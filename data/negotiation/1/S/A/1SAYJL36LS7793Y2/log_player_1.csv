Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, while still ensuring I get a profit significantly higher than my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is my minimum value, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $18,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $15,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.  It's also a good compromise that still allows me to profit comfortably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is too low. It's below my minimum value and not worth continuing the negotiation.  I'll sell the product to John for $12,000, ensuring I at least get my minimum value."
