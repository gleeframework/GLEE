"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $950,000 is too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?  This price reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a significant return on your investment.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1,025,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's split the difference - $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair and balanced price for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
