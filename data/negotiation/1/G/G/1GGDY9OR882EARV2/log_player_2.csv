"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let me know if you're interested!
