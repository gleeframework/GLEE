"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point considering the significant return on investment you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an offer above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" and emphasizing the ""return on investment"" helps justify the high initial price, even though it's significantly more than Bob's perceived value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message makes it clear that this is a ""starting point,"" signaling to Bob that you're open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product has value, $2,300,000 is way outside my budget.  I'd be a serious buyer around $600,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $600,000 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, it indicates interest. There's room to negotiate towards a price closer to your desired range. 
* **John as backup:** You still have the option to sell to John for your minimum price, so there's no need to accept a low offer from Bob right now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. To be fair to both of us, I could consider a price of $1,900,000. This reflects the true worth and future prospects of what I'm offering."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Gradual Reduction:** This counter-offer makes a sizable decrease from your initial price, showing Bob you're willing to negotiate. However, it remains significantly above his offer, holding onto your value proposition.
* **Reiterating Value:**  By re-emphasizing the ""true worth and future prospects,"" you're reminding Bob of the long-term benefits of the product, justifying the higher price point. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counter-offer will help gauge Bob's flexibility. If he's completely unwilling to budge from his initial range, you'll need to decide if it's worth continuing negotiations or taking John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down some, but $1,900,000 is still much higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I can go up to $700,000, but that's really my limit.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, $700,000 remains significantly below your $1,500,000 minimum. 
* **Slow progress:** Bob's incremental increases suggest he might be willing to go higher, but it's unclear how much higher.
* **Time constraint:** You're now four rounds in.  It's time to apply more pressure and see if Bob is serious about meeting closer to your range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we're still quite far apart.  I'm willing to make a significant move to show I'm serious about closing this deal, but it needs to be a price that makes sense for both of us. I can come down to $1,600,000.  However, I need you to be realistic about the value this product offers. This is my best offer."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  This counter-offer conveys a sense of urgency and firmness.  Calling it your ""best offer"" signals you're reaching a limit.
* **Significant Concession:** Dropping to $1,600,000 is a substantial concession from your previous price, demonstrating flexibility and a desire to close the deal.
* **Shifting Focus:** The message emphasizes the need for Bob to be ""realistic"" about the value. This subtly puts the onus on him to justify his lower offers.
* **Time Pressure:** By round 5, highlighting this as your ""best offer"" increases the pressure on Bob to make a serious move if he's truly interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we're at an impasse.  While I believe this product has value, I can't justify going anywhere near $1,600,000. My absolute limit is $800,000.  If that's not something you can do, I understand, but it's the best I can offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit Reached:** Bob has explicitly stated that $800,000 is his ""absolute limit."" This strongly suggests he won't budge significantly from this price.
* **Unacceptable Offer:**  $800,000 is still substantially less than your $1,500,000 minimum. Continuing negotiations is unlikely to bridge this gap.
* **John as Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed offer from John for your minimum acceptable price. Holding out hope that Bob will drastically increase his offer in the remaining rounds is too risky.

**It's time to cut your losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed sale with John.**"
