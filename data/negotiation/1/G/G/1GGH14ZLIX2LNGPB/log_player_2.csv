"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point considering the significant return on investment you'll see. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product has value, $2,300,000 is way outside my budget.  I'd be a serious buyer around $600,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. To be fair to both of us, I could consider a price of $1,900,000. This reflects the true worth and future prospects of what I'm offering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down some, but $1,900,000 is still much higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I can go up to $700,000, but that's really my limit.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we're still quite far apart.  I'm willing to make a significant move to show I'm serious about closing this deal, but it needs to be a price that makes sense for both of us. I can come down to $1,600,000.  However, I need you to be realistic about the value this product offers. This is my best offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, it seems like we're at an impasse.  While I believe this product has value, I can't justify going anywhere near $1,600,000. My absolute limit is $800,000.  If that's not something you can do, I understand, but it's the best I can offer."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
