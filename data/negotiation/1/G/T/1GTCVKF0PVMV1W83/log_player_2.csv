{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob.  Since Bob has a backup option with John, it's best to reject Alice's offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his maximum budget of $800,000. This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's original price, but still leaves some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer is still above Bob's budget. While it's slightly lower than her initial offer, it's not enough to make it worthwhile for Bob. He should continue negotiating to try and get a better price, especially since he has a guaranteed option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of progressively getting closer to his budget while still showing willingness to negotiate.  This offer is a slight increase from his previous counteroffer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob. She seems unwilling to budge much closer to his budget, and further negotiation might not be fruitful. At this point, it's better for Bob to secure the product from John at his predetermined price, guaranteeing the purchase within his budget."
