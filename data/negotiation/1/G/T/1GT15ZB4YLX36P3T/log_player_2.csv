"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get this valuable item at a discount. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $120, which is still above Bob's maximum budget of $150.
* **Strategy:**  Reject the offer and counteroffer to get a lower price.  There are still 9 rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'd be happy to pay $105 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Initial offer:** $120 was too high.
* **Counteroffer strategy:**  Start with a significant but reasonable drop in price to test Alice's willingness to negotiate. $105 is still above Alice's value of $100, giving her room to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $115, which is still higher than Bob's ideal price but within his budget.
* **Strategy:**  Reject the offer and counteroffer again.  Since Alice is already willing to compromise,  Bob can potentially get a lower price by continuing to negotiate. There are still 7 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice.  $115 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $110?  Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $115 was a step in the right direction but still too high.
* **Counteroffer strategy:**  A counteroffer of $110 is a further compromise, signaling Bob's seriousness while leaving room for Alice to accept.  This is a good midpoint between the two offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $110 is still a bit above your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $112. It's a fair price, considering the value it brings, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $112, which is within Bob's budget and only $2 above his previous counteroffer.
* **Strategy:**  Accept the offer.  While Bob could potentially continue negotiating, the risk of Alice walking away or Bob running out of rounds is increasing.  At $112, the deal is reasonable, especially with only 5 rounds remaining.  Buying from John for $150 is a much worse option."
