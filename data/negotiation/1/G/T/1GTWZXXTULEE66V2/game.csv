"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $20,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but $20,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,000. I believe that's a fair starting point that acknowledges its value while reflecting a price I'm comfortable with.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $17,500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being a reasonable offer for you.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $17,500 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $14,000? That seems like a fair compromise, getting us closer to a deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to make another concession, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to go down to $16,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price that balances our interests and gets us closer to a deal.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the continued negotiation. I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm keen to make this work. How about we settle at $14,500?  It's a fair offer, and it allows us both to walk away feeling positive about the deal.",14500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $16,000. I think $14,500 is a bit too low for the product's value. How about we meet in the middle at $15,250? This way, we can both feel good about the price and move forward with the sale.",15250.0,Alice,7,
