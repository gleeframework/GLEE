"I appreciate your time and consideration, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $6,500 is significantly below what I need to get for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? This would still be a good value for you, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $7,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in making a deal, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  $7,000 is closer to what I need, but I'm still a bit short.  If you're truly serious about acquiring the product, how about we split the difference and settle on $7,250?  This would represent a fair compromise for both of us.",7250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $7,000, and that's as high as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $8,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make a decision soon.",7000.0,Bob,6,
