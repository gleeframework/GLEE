Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, as it gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit. I'm confident I can get more than my minimum price of $150, but I want to leave some room for negotiation to increase the chances of a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to sell for $50, as that's significantly less than my minimum price.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering with $175. This is still a good profit for me, but it's closer to Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping that this will encourage him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not enough for me to make a decent profit. I'm not willing to sell for that low, and I'm hoping that I can negotiate a higher price.  I'll reject his offer and try again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm counteroffering with $160. I'm still willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm making a reasonable profit. I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product and Bob's previous offer. I'm hoping he'll accept this counteroffer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is significantly below my minimum price and even lower than his previous offer.  It's clear we're too far apart in our valuations. It's time to move on to a buyer who is willing to pay closer to my asking price.  John will pay me $150, which is a much better deal."
