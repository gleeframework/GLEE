"I appreciate your understanding of the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I have to consider my own valuation of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $11000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. How about we try $9800?",9800.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I still need to make a decent profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my original asking price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued flexibility, Alice, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. How about we try $9500 again, or even better, $9200?",9200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm getting a bit concerned that we're getting too far away from my original asking price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10200. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but $10200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm starting to think that buying from John might be a better option, but I'd like to give you one last chance. How about we try $9500 again, or even better, $9000?",9000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $10000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling to John. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,9,
