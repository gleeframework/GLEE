Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is strategic:

* **It's higher than your minimum acceptable price of $100**, ensuring you make a profit even if Bob rejects. 
* **It's lower than the product's value to Bob ($150)**, giving him an incentive to accept and still get a good deal. 

By offering a price close to Bob's perceived value, I increase the chances of him accepting the offer, leading to a higher profit for me."
