{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $85.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than the product's worth to me ($80) because I want to see if I can get a better deal. I'm also being friendly and confident to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $75 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $80.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $75 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $82.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 82}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $82. How about $78? I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $78 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still not quite there. I'm willing to take a slight loss on the deal, but I don't want to go below $80.  John is offering a guaranteed $80, so I'll choose to sell to him instead."
