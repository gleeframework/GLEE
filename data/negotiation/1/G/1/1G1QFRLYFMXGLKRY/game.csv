"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know your thoughts!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $10,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $10,000.  Would you be willing to go down to $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay under $10,000, and I appreciate your continued interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $9,500 is still a little too low. Would you consider $9,800? This would be a great price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know if that works for you.",9800.0,Alice,5,
