# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I think it's worth discussing a price of $18,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I'm open to negotiations if you have a different number in mind.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $12,000. This price still reflects the value the product brings to you, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're making progress, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from the last offer, so let's try $14,000. This price is more in line with my minimum value for the product, and I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me there.

Alice is unlikely to come down to a price I'm comfortable with. It's time to cut my losses and go with John's guaranteed offer."
