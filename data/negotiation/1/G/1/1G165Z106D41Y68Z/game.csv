"I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I think it's worth discussing a price of $18,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I'm open to negotiations if you have a different number in mind.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but $18,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $12,000. This price still reflects the value the product brings to you, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"You're right, $6,000 was a bit low. How about we split the difference again and settle on $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're making progress, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from the last offer, so let's try $14,000. This price is more in line with my minimum value for the product, and I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me there.",14000.0,Alice,5,
