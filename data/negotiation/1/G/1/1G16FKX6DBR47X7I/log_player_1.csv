Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it's worth at least $10,000, but I'm willing to part with it for $12,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

Here's why this approach makes sense:

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a price that's profitable for you. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning that the product is worth at least $10,000 (which is Bob's perceived value), you are subtly anchoring the price in his mind.
* **Time Sensitivity:** Implying you have other options (listing it publicly) creates a sense of urgency and might encourage Bob to act quickly."
