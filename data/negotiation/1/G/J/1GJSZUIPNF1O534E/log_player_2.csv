You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is trying to inflate the price by claiming it's worth $10,000 to me. While I'm willing to spend up to $10,000, I know John will sell it for that much.  There's a chance I can get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if she'll come down in price."
