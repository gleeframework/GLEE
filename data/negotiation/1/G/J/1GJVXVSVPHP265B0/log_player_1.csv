Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120.  It's in great condition and worth a lot to the right person.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $120 is significantly more than your minimum of $80, giving you room to negotiate.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $120 is still less than what the product is worth to Bob ($150), giving him incentive to buy.
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  You're upfront about the price and give a reason why it's worth it. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $90 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is above my minimum, it's still below my desired price point.  I'm going to counter Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $105?  That's still a good deal for you, considering how much it's worth to you."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise that gives Bob a better deal than my initial offer, but still allows me to make a decent profit."
