Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to get as close to my minimum as possible.  Since Bob values the product at $800,000, this offer is significantly higher than his value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This strategy allows me to gauge his interest and potentially find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low for me.  While I'd like to secure a sale, I can't afford to sell for so much less than my minimum.  I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can find a price closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but still keeping it significantly higher than Bob's offer. This demonstrates flexibility while also trying to secure a price that's closer to my desired value.  I believe this counteroffer is reasonable enough to encourage further negotiation while still being within my acceptable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm getting closer to my desired price, I'm not willing to settle for a price that's far from my minimum. I'm going to counteroffer one more time to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. If he rejects again, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

```

This is my final counteroffer. It's a significant compromise, bringing the price down to $1 million, which is still higher than Bob's offer, but closer to his perceived value.  I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, while still maintaining a fair price for me. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll move on to selling the product to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value.  I've already made several concessions, and further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a price I'm comfortable with.  Therefore, I'll sell the product to John, ensuring I get a price that meets my minimum requirements."
