"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's important to stick to my minimum acceptable price.  Since I have another buyer (John) willing to pay $150, which meets my minimum, it makes the most sense to sell the product to him."
