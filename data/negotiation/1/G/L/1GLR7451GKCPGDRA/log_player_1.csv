"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth at least $100 to me, and Bob's offer is below that. I will try to get a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $105? That's still a good price for you, considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 105}

Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $95 is still just a bit too low. How about $100? That's my absolute minimum, but it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 100}
