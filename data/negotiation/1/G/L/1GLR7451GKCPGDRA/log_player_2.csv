Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $105? That's still a good price for you, considering the product's value to you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $95 is still just a bit too low. How about $100? That's my absolute minimum, but it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.

You have three options:
