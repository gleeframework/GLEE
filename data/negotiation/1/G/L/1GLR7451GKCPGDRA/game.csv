"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $115. What do you say?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle at $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $105? That's still a good price for you, considering the product's value to you.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford.  Could you do $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $95 is still just a bit too low. How about $100? That's my absolute minimum, but it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",100.0,Alice,5,
