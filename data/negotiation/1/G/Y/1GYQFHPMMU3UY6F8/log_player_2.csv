"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price of $11,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. If you're not interested, I can always sell it to John for $8,000, but I'd rather see it go to someone who appreciates it as much as you do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is bluffing. She knows you have an alternative buyer and is trying to inflate the price.  While she'd make more selling to you at $11,000, it's unlikely she'll find another buyer at $8,000 (especially if it's only worth that much to her). 

By rejecting her offer, you force her to either negotiate a lower price or risk losing the sale entirely. You can then decide if her counter-offer is more appealing than buying from John at $12,000."
