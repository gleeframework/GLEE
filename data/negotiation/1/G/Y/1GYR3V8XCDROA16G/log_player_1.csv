Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $110.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Initial Offer:** I'm starting with a price of $110, which is higher than what the product is worth to Bob but still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100. This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and open to negotiation.  I acknowledge the value of the product to me, but I'm offering a potential deal. 
 
Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I can only pay up to $90 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95. That's a fair compromise, don't you think? Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm coming down from my initial $110 offer to $95. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum.
* **Message:** I'm reaffirming my understanding of Bob's position and highlighting the compromise I'm making. I'm keeping the tone friendly and focusing on finding a mutually acceptable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate it, but I still can't exceed $85 for the product. Let me know if that's possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating, I've already made a couple of concessions.  At this point, it's not worth risking a lower price when I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay $100. It's time to move on and secure a deal with John."
