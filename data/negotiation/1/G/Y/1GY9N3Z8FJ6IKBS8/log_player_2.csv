Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting, Bob! But I think we can do better than $108. How about we meet at $110? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $110.  Continuing to negotiate might save a few dollars, but it also risks Alice pulling back and the deal falling through.  It's a good idea to accept the offer and secure the product for a price significantly lower than John's $150."
