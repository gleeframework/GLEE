"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I was thinking. This product would be useful to me, but it's not essential, so I'd be willing to pay $6,000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. I could meet you halfway from my original offer. How about $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still too high for me.  Could you do $8,000? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",8000.0,Bob,4,
