"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, which I know will be a valuable asset for your business.  My initial price is $950,000, reflecting the significant value it brings. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is the maximum I'm comfortable with. Can we meet in the middle at $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I value your business, $875,000 is below my minimum.  Let's aim for a more mutually beneficial arrangement.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price still reflects the value I bring to your operation, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's keep this negotiation moving forward.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $825,000. Can we discuss further?",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point and appreciate your persistence. While $825,000 is still below my minimum, I'm willing to meet you halfway once again. Let's settle on $862,500. This price reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair value considering the benefits this product will bring to your operations.  I'm hoping we can reach a final agreement in this round.",862500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but $862,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, but no more. Can we discuss further?",825000.0,Bob,6,
