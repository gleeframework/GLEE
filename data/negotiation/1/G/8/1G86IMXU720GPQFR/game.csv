"Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $80. Would you be willing to consider that?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $100. It's a fair price considering its value, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $100 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. How about $90? It's a fair compromise that I think we can both agree on.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire for a compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $90. I'll meet you at $95. It's a slight concession, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value.",95.0,Alice,5,
