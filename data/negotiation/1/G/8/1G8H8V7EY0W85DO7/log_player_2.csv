"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your target price of $15,000.**  
* **Rejecting allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price.** 
* **Buying from John immediately is not the best option because you could potentially get a better deal with Alice.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $14,000, but I'm really hoping to get it for a bit less.  How about $13,000? That would be a great price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $13,800. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of this product at this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is $13,800, which is still within your budget of $15,000.**  
* **This price is a good compromise, and you are likely to save more money by accepting this offer than by continuing to negotiate or buying from John.**
* **The risk of further negotiation is that Alice might increase the price again, making the deal less favorable.**"
