"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I'm very interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11000 for it. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $13500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for this unique product.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  $13500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12500.  I truly believe this is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm still a bit far from my target. I can meet you halfway between $12500 and $13500, which is $13000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",13000.0,Alice,5,
