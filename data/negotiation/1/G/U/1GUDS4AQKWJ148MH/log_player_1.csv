Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to secure this product for a bit less. Given its potential value, I'm willing to pay $1200000. This price reflects a fair value considering the market and allows for both of us to walk away happy. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.

Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1350000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1250000. This price acknowledges the product's value while remaining within my budget.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $1,250,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not at a point where I'm willing to settle.  I believe there's room for further negotiation and will make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, but $1,250,000 just doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1300000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1275000. This price is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's close this agreement and move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd ideally like to get closer to $1,300,000, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  $1,275,000 is a good compromise and allows me to secure a substantial profit."
