,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900000 is simply too low. I'm willing to go down to $1050000. This reflects the product's value to you and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1050000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1025000. Can you consider that?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1025000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1037500? This would give you a significant discount from my original offer and would be a good deal for both of us.  Let's make this happen!",1037500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1037500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'd be willing to go up to $1025000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",1025000.0,Bob,6,
