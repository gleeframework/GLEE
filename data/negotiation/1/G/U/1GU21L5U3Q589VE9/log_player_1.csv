"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** 

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I need to earn. I have 8 rounds left, and I can get a higher offer or even sell to John for $1,200,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000. This reflects the product's value to you and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1050000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1025000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,025,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. I have 6 rounds left, and I believe I can push for a better offer. It's also worth noting that I can still sell to John for $1,200,000, so I'm not desperate to close the deal with Bob at this moment."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,037,500? This would give you a significant discount from my original offer and would be a good deal for both of us.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1037500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1037500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'd be willing to go up to $1025000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are down to our last 4 rounds, and Bob is stubbornly sticking to $1,025,000. While that's a decent offer, it's still not enough to make it worthwhile for me considering my minimum goal of $1,200,000. John is a reliable buyer who is willing to pay my minimum, so it's the safer and more profitable option at this point."
