"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a special price of $9,500. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer opens the possibility of her making a counter-offer at a lower price, closer to her perceived value of $8,000.  If she doesn't offer a better price, you can always buy from John."
