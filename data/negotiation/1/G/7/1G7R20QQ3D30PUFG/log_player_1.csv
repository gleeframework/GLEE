Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think it would be perfect for you, and this is a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:** Offering the product at $125 starts the negotiation above Bob's perceived value but is still low enough to potentially entice him. 
* **Creating Perceived Value:** The message emphasizes a ""special price"" and a ""great deal"" to make Bob feel like he's getting a unique opportunity.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While I want to maximize profit, starting at $125 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer.  Even if he negotiates down slightly, I'll still earn more than selling to John.

This strategy aims to balance maximizing profit with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
