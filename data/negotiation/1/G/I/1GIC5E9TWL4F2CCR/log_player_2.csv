(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's a great deal for you, saving you $300,000. There's no need to risk further negotiation or buying from John at a higher price."
