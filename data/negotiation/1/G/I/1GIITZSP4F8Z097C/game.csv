"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its features and market value, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident it can significantly benefit you.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $20,000 reflects its true value, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I could potentially go up to $11,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know if that works for you.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your reply.  I appreciate you working with me on this. To be honest, $11,000 is quite a bit below what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?  That's a significant reduction on my end.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $14,000 is a compromise, but it's still a bit too high for my budget. I could stretch to $11,500 as a final offer.  If that doesn't work, I might have to explore other options.",11500.0,Bob,6,
