"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I do see the potential in this product, $15000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8000, which is the maximum I can afford right now.  Let me know if you're interested in negotiating further.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I can offer you a compromise at $12000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12000 is still above my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8000. It's the highest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price given the potential of the product.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $8000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you $10000, which is a significant discount from my original price. I think it's a fair compromise, considering the value the product can bring to your business. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is still a bit out of my reach. I'm willing to go up to $9000, which is a compromise from my previous offer. I'm confident this price reflects the product's value and gives us both a good deal. What do you say?",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer you $11000, which is closer to my original price. I think it's a fair compromise, considering the value the product can bring to your business. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,7,
