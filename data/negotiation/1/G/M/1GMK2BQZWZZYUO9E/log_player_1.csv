"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This is a price that is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000 but leaves room for negotiation.  It also reflects the fact that I know the product is worth more to Bob.  By starting high, I maximize my potential profit while still leaving room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I still have time to negotiate. By rejecting his offer, I can attempt to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price to $11,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise while still keeping my profit margin above my minimum acceptable price. I believe this price is still attractive enough to Bob considering the value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,500 is a significant improvement over his previous offer and is closer to my desired price. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk of reaching a stalemate or Bob deciding to walk away.  It's also worth considering that John is offering $10,000, making this a good opportunity to secure a profit."
