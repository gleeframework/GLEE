"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I do like the product, $15,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

We are starting with a low offer to see how much negotiating room we have.  It's important to be polite but firm in our counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit high for you, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but the price is still above our budget. We can counteroffer again to try and get closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle, Alice.  How about we try $9,500?  I think that would be a fair price."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

We are moving closer to Alice's price but staying within a reasonable range of our budget.  We need to show we are willing to negotiate but also stand firm on not overpaying."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not comfortable with $9,500. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I think $11,000 is my minimum. I'm confident that you'll find this product valuable, and I'm willing to meet you at this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice seems to be holding firm around $11,000.  While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely we'll get her much lower.  Buying from John for $10,000 ensures we stay within budget and don't waste time on further haggling."
