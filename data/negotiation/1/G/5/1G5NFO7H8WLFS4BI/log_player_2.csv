Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider your proposal. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll offer the product to you for $1,025,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

We've reached a point where further haggling is unlikely to yield significant savings. Accepting at $1,025,000 is a reasonable compromise."
