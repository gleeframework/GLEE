Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can do better. How about $90 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $90 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still below my minimum of $120. I'll counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about $95?  This would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. Let's try $90 again. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob is persistent, $90 is still below my minimum. I'll counteroffer again, hopefully getting closer to my goal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $90 is just too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $92.50.  This way, we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 92.5} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts, Alice. Let's try $90 one more time. It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has stubbornly stuck to his $90 offer, and it's clear he won't budge. I've already made several counteroffers, and the negotiation isn't progressing.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $120. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a better outcome than accepting Bob's low offer."
