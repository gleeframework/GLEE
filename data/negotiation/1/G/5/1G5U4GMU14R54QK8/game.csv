"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it can be a game-changer for you.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. Given its potential, I believe this is a very fair offer.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential in this product, $1,500,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000, a price that I believe is still fair considering the value it brings. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,200,000? This price reflects the value it brings while recognizing your interest.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer. I believe this price reflects a fair balance between the product's value and my budget.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
