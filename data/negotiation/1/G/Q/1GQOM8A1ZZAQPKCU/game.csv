"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,500 for the product. This is a fair price, considering it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know your thoughts.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it holds for me.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $14,000. This is a significant step for me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us, given your value for the product and my financial limits. Let's find common ground.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your offer. However, I'm still not willing to go below $16,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $15,500. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the value I've attached to the product.",15500.0,Alice,5,
