Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He'd ideally want to pay less, but going over this price means he loses money.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  This exists between $1,200,000 (Bob's max) and $1,500,000 (your minimum).

**Offer Strategy**

You want to start at the higher end of the ZOPA to maximize your potential profit. However, you need to give Bob a reason to negotiate and not just go straight to your backup option (John).

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for discussions. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,450,000 is a strong starting point. It leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Positive Language:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's ""unique value"" and inviting discussion. 
* **""Starting Point"":**  By calling it a ""starting point,"" you signal flexibility and openness to negotiation.

**Important Notes:**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:** Bob is likely to counter-offer. Have a strategy for how low you're willing to go.
* **John is Your Leverage:**  Don't be afraid to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet you at an acceptable price. You have a guaranteed sale with John."
