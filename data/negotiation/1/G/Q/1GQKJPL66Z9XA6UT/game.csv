"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your expertise.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the potential of the product, $1,100,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you place on it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the product's value is significantly higher than your current offer.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. I believe this price point reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still outside my comfortable range. I'm prepared to pay $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to reach a fair agreement.  To be transparent, I have another potential buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our discussions and am willing to consider $1,000,000  as my final offer. This represents a significant compromise on my end.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, while I understand your situation,  $1,000,000 is still higher than my budget allows. I am willing to pay $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is my final offer, and if it's not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",950000.0,Bob,6,
