"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Offer:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but lower than my minimum of $1,500,000. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone, emphasizing the value of the product. I'm also trying to build a relationship with Bob to encourage a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $900,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is higher than his initial stated value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I want to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a more favorable price.  There are still 8 rounds left, and I believe there's room for compromise.
* **Selling to John:** Selling to John right now would guarantee me $1,500,000, but I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $900,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. I'd be willing to sell for $1,200,000. This still leaves you with a good deal, and it's a price I can work with."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price from $1,750,000 to $1,200,000. This shows a willingness to negotiate and potentially meet in the middle.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value proposition for Bob, highlighting that the price still offers him a good deal.
* **Continuing Negotiation:**  By continuing the negotiation, I'm hoping to close the gap further and get closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That being said, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I believe there's still room to negotiate and potentially close the deal at a price closer to my target. 
* **Selling to John:** Selling to John would guarantee me $1,500,000, but I'm hoping to get a better price through negotiation with Bob. I have 6 rounds left, which is a good amount of time to continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still too low. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1,125,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm offering to meet Bob halfway between his last offer ($1,050,000) and my previous offer ($1,200,000). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and find common ground.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I'm framing the price as ""fair"" and highlighting the value of the product.
* **Continuing Negotiation:** I'm still hoping to get a better price but also recognizing the need to find a middle ground. With 5 rounds remaining, there's still time to reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down further.  However, I need the price to be closer to my budget for this to work. How about we settle at $1,000,000 even?  That's a significant amount and demonstrates my serious interest in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Stalemate:** We've reached a point where Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum. Further negotiation may not lead to a significantly better price.
* **Time Constraint:** We're down to 4 rounds remaining.  There's a risk that I may not be able to secure a better deal within this timeframe.
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price of $1,500,000. This is a much more favorable outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob. 

Given the current negotiation status and the time constraint, selling to John is the most prudent decision."
