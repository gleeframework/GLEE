"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its high value to you, I propose a price of $12000 for the product. This price not only ensures a fair return on my investment but also leaves room for you to maximize your potential gains from the product's usage. I look forward to discussing this opportunity further with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. I can get the product for $15,000 from John, which is a better deal for me than Alice's offer of $12,000.
