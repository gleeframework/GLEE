"Alice,  $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $800,000.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000 to make this deal work.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 represents the true value of this product, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a significant reduction on my end and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the concession, but $1,025,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. If we can meet in the middle, I think we can make this work. ",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for your continued interest. It seems we're getting closer.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to accept $985,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget limitations.",985000.0,Alice,5,
