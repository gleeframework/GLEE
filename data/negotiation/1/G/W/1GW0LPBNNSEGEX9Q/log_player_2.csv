Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, but $975,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I can do $1,025,000, which is my final concession. If you're willing to meet me here, we can finalize the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

**Reasoning:** While I could try to negotiate further, Alice has stated this is her final offer.  The difference between her price ($1,025,000) and John's backup offer ($1,200,000) is significant enough to warrant accepting. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing it for a potentially insignificant saving."
