"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I need to make a fair profit, so I'm starting with an offer of $1,100,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we bring it down to $900,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $975,000? That's a significant step closer to my budget.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, but $975,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I can do $1,025,000, which is my final concession. If you're willing to meet me here, we can finalize the sale.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
