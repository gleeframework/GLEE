"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,800,000 undervalues it considerably.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,100,000. I believe this price reflects the product's worth while still offering you a good deal. What do you think?",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I still think the product is overpriced. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned. Can you consider this counteroffer?",2000000.0,Bob,4,
