"Bob, I understand you want to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $9500. This is the best price I can offer, but I think it's still a great value for you.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I can see you're serious about getting a good deal. I'm willing to meet you at $9000, but I'd like to add a slight premium for the hassle of negotiating with me. How about we do $9250? I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",9250.0,Alice,5,
