Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 allows for some negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **High Anchor:** This initial price sets a high anchor point, making Bob more receptive to a price slightly lower, should he choose to negotiate.
* **Alternative Option:** While John provides a safety net at $800,000, securing a deal with Bob is significantly more profitable."
