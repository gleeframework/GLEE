"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm happy to make a counteroffer of $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but I'm afraid $950,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product, and I think it's a good compromise between our initial offers.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $1,025,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This would allow you to make a profit, and I would be happy to finalize the deal. ",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,000,000, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price of $1,200,000. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
