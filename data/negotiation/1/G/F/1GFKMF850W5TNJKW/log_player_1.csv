Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm happy to make a counteroffer of $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but I'm afraid $950,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This would allow you to make a profit, and I would be happy to finalize the deal.
