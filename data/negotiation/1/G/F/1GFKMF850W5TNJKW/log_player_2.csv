# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my budget. It's worth exploring if we can negotiate a lower price.  I'm confident I can do better than $1,100,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but I'm afraid $950,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product, and I think it's a good compromise between our initial offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to my target price, but it's still a bit higher than I'd like.  I'm confident I can push for a lower price.  We're both getting closer, but I'm not ready to buy just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $1,025,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This would allow you to make a profit, and I would be happy to finalize the deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,000,000, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price of $1,200,000. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my target price, but it's still a bit high.  I've already made several counteroffers, and we haven't reached a price I'm comfortable with.  To avoid further negotiation, I'm going to take John up on his offer. It's a fair price, and I'm happy to finalize the deal."
