Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $13,000 is still too low for me, and I think I can get closer to my asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  Let's see if we can agree on a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
