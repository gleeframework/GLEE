"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Bob is willing to pay a maximum of $12,000 for the product, and Alice is offering it at the exact same price, there's no immediate benefit to accepting her offer.  Bob can always buy it from John for the same price. Rejecting Alice's offer keeps the option open to potentially negotiate a lower price with her or find a better deal elsewhere."
