"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. I'm confident you'll love it!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This price reflects its value to me while still giving you a good return. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I put into it. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let's try to find a compromise here.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,800. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I put into it. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",10800.0,Alice,5,
