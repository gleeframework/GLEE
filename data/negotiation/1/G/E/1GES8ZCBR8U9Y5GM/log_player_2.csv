"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product, and I think it's worth considering a price of $9,500. It's a unique opportunity to own something that's worth $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to make a deal that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $9,500 is only slightly below your maximum budget of $10,000. 
* You know John is willing to sell for $10,000. 
* There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further if you reject the initial offer. It's worth seeing if you can get a better deal."
