"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your interest. While $900,000 is a good offer, it's below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.

"Bob, I see your point, but $925,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $940,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's close this negotiation.",940000.0,Alice,5,
