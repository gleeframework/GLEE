Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $200,000 profit margin.
* **One Shot:** You only get one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you lose the chance to get more than $1,000,000.

**Strategy**

You need to balance maximizing your potential profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.  Here's a strategy:

1. **Aim High, But Be Realistic:** Don't start at $1,200,000. Bob likely won't accept paying his full valuation.  Aim slightly lower to give yourself room to negotiate if needed.
2. **Confident Justification:**  Even without specifics about the ""product,"" you can imply its value in your message. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will generate significant returns for you, far exceeding your investment. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  The message positions the product as valuable and exclusive, appealing to Bob's potential profit.
* **Strategic Price:** $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even if it's just John) might encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is just one approach. The best negotiation strategy depends on the context of the situation and your understanding of Bob's personality and negotiation style."
