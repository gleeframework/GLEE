Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? I'm willing to make a deal with you at this price, but I need to let you know that I have another interested buyer who is willing to pay the full price, so I need to make a decision soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

Alice is now matching John's price. There's no guarantee of getting a better deal from Alice and further negotiation might risk losing the product.  It's best to accept the current offer."
