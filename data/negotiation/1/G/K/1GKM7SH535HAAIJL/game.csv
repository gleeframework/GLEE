"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $80? I'm willing to pay that much for it.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $120. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $120 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we meet in the middle at $100? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $100. I'm willing to give you a small discount, but I need to make a profit. I'll offer it to you for $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,5,
