"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price."

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $500,000 at this time.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $500000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm thinking of a price that's higher than $500000, but lower than my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $1200000? This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still above my budget, but it's getting closer. I'm going to reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There's still room for compromise."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1,200,000 is closer to my budget, but still a bit high.  Let's split the difference and go with $900,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $900000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900000 and $1200000, which would be $1050000. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still above my budget.  While it's tempting to buy from her, I'm going to reject her offer and counter with a final offer.  If Alice doesn't budge, I can always buy from John for $1,000,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $1200000? This is my last offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product. If not, I'll have to consider other options.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is sticking to her price of $1,200,000, which is still above my maximum budget.  I've already made multiple counteroffers, and it's clear that we're not going to agree on a price.  It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  While it's not the best deal, it's still within my budget and I'm able to move forward with the purchase."
