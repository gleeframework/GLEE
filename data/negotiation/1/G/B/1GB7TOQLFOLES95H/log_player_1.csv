Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $12,000."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Starting High:**  Beginning with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit margin.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies high value without directly stating it, making Bob more inclined to consider the offer. 

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or seems hesitant. You can always lower the price, but you can't raise it once offered."
