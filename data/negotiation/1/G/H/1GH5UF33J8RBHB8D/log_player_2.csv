"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I think it's worth your consideration. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is better than Alice's initial valuation of $10,000, it's still above Bob's maximum of $8,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm happy to come down to $9,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  There is still room for negotiation before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,750, which is a fair compromise. This price is closer to my budget and would allow us to finalize the deal. "", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and the offer of $8,750.  While I'm willing to make concessions, that price is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,900. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting close to his maximum budget, but Alice's offer of $8,900 is still within his range. It's a good compromise and allows Bob to save some money compared to buying from John. There's a risk of continuing negotiations, but there's also a risk of Alice walking away or making a worse counteroffer. It's better to accept this offer and finalize the deal."
