"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth.  What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I think the product is worth less than $2,200,000. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $1,800,000 is significantly below my valuation for this product and the potential it holds. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of what's being offered.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. While $1,900,000 is still less than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to accept that price if we can close the deal today.  This is my final offer.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
