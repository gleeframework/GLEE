Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, I think the product is worth less than $2,200,000. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. Can you consider this offer?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable paying $1,900,000. I'm willing to pay $1,850,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?

While I could push for more, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $1,850,000 is a significant profit, and it avoids the risk of him walking away completely."
