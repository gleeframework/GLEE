"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I've done my research and I believe the product's value is lower than your initial offer. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $700,000. I'd like to propose a price of $700,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below the product's value to both of us. Accepting would be a substantial loss. While there's a risk Bob won't agree to a much higher price, it's worth negotiating further before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 undervalues the product significantly. It offers unique capabilities and potential that justify a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly, but not to that extent. How about $925,000?"", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

We want to signal flexibility but remain firm on a price closer to the product's actual value. This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation while aiming for a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that the product has unique capabilities, but I still believe $925,000 is too high. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to propose a price of $775,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also being reasonable for my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we're still below our minimum and have room to negotiate. It's too early to settle at $775,000 when John's offer is a viable alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $775,000 is just too low for me to accept.  However, I am eager to find a solution that works for both of us. If you're willing to meet me at $875,000, we have a deal."",
""product_price"": 875000
}
``` 

This counter-offer does a few key things:

* **Firm but Fair:**  We're holding strong above our minimum ($800,000) but showing a willingness to negotiate down from our previous offer. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By presenting it as a ""take it or leave it"" deal, we're encouraging Bob to make a decision.
* **Still Above John's Offer:**  We have a safety net with John, so we can be more assertive in these later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $875,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $875,000, so I'd like to propose a price of $862,500. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also being reasonable for my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $862,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $862,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is getting very close to our target, and this offer is well above John's $800,000.  Accepting now secures a significant profit and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer in subsequent rounds."
