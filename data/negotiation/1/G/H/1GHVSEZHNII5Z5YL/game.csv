"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your time, Alice. I've done my research and I believe the product's value is lower than your initial offer. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $700,000. I'd like to propose a price of $700,000 for the product.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 undervalues the product significantly. It offers unique capabilities and potential that justify a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly, but not to that extent. How about $925,000?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that the product has unique capabilities, but I still believe $925,000 is too high. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to propose a price of $775,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also being reasonable for my budget.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $775,000 is just too low for me to accept.  However, I am eager to find a solution that works for both of us. If you're willing to meet me at $875,000, we have a deal.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $875,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $875,000, so I'd like to propose a price of $862,500. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also being reasonable for my budget.",862500.0,Bob,6,
