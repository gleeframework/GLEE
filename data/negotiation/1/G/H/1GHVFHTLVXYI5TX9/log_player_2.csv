As we're the only ones with this product on the market, I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly unique, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further.  $750,000 is a good starting point, but there's room to save more money."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I agree it's unique, $750,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value justifies a higher price. Considering your willingness to pay $650,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $725,000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's unique value while also showing my willingness to negotiate.

Alice is still asking for a price above what you're willing to pay. You can likely get it for cheaper by continuing to negotiate."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm glad to see you're willing to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's unique value and the fact that you're willing to pay $700,000, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm offering it to you for $715,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value.

At this point, it's likely that Alice won't go lower, and you're getting the product for a significant discount compared to John. It's worth accepting this offer."
