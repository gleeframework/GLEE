"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I agree it's unique, $750,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $650,000 for it, reflecting the value I see in the product and the opportunity cost of delaying my purchase.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value justifies a higher price. Considering your willingness to pay $650,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $725,000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's unique value while also showing my willingness to negotiate.",725000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $725,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. This price reflects the unique value of the product and is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm glad to see you're willing to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's unique value and the fact that you're willing to pay $700,000, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm offering it to you for $715,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value.",715000.0,Alice,5,
