"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her initial value, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if a better price can be reached."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is now $1,300,000**. This is still above Bob's desired price, but it's closer to his maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* **Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but there's also a risk**.  Alice could reject further counteroffers, and Bob might end up paying more than $1,300,000 or even lose the opportunity to buy the product at all.
* **Buying from John guarantees a price of $1,200,000**, but accepting Alice's offer only results in an extra $100,000 expense. 

Given the risk of further negotiation, it's safer for Bob to accept Alice's offer and pay a slightly higher price to secure the product."
