"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it's a fair price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. It's a bit lower than your original price, but I believe it's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I have 8 more rounds to try and negotiate a higher price. It's worth seeing if I can push for a better deal with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is still a significant value for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1350000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer $1300000. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is close to my desired price and significantly higher than John's offer. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and avoids further negotiation rounds, which might lead to a lower price or even a failed deal."
