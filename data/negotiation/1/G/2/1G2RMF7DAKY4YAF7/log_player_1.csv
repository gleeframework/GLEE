"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe will be highly valuable to your business. My asking price is $1,000,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire a product worth $1,200,000 to you.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a good start, but I'm looking to acquire this product for a price closer to its value to me. I'd like to offer you $900,000. This allows for a significant profit for you while still leaving room for me to make a good return on my investment. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $900,000 is a good offer, it's still lower than my desired price point. I want to see if I can push for a higher price before accepting or resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  While I value our potential partnership, I need to remain closer to my initial price point. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This still leaves substantial room for you to realize the value of this product. Let's aim for a deal that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, I'm still not quite there yet. I'd like to counter with $925,000. This represents a good middle ground that allows both of us to walk away with a satisfactory outcome. Let's bridge the gap and finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $925,000 is a good middle ground and a significant improvement over his previous offer. Accepting this offer would net me a profit of $125,000, which is still a substantial gain. It's important to remember that there are only a limited number of rounds left, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether."
