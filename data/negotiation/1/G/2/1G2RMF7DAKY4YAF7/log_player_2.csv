"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe will be highly valuable to your business. My asking price is $1,000,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire a product worth $1,200,000 to you.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You can get the product for less than $1,200,000 from John. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good start, but I'm looking to acquire this product for a price closer to its value to me. I'd like to offer you $900,000. This allows for a significant profit for you while still leaving room for me to make a good return on my investment. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  While I value our potential partnership, I need to remain closer to my initial price point. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This still leaves substantial room for you to realize the value of this product. Let's aim for a deal that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but her offer is still too high. You're still better off continuing to negotiate with her, as you can potentially get a better deal. Buying from John at $1,200,000 is still the least desirable option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, I'm still not quite there yet. I'd like to counter with $925,000. This represents a good middle ground that allows both of us to walk away with a satisfactory outcome. Let's bridge the gap and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}
