"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product, and I think you'd really find it valuable. I'm offering it to you for $180. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is way above my limit. I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $100 for it.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($100) to leave room for negotiation. This anchors the discussion at a lower price point.
* **Expressing Interest:** I don't want to completely discourage Alice, so I'm indicating genuine interest in the product while making it clear that the initial price is a deal-breaker. 
* **Aiming for the Middle:** My goal is to get the price closer to $120 (the price I can get it from John). By starting low, I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm open to negotiation. How about we meet in the middle at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice is moving in the right direction, coming down from $180 to $140. This shows she's willing to negotiate. 
* **Still Above Limit:** $140 is still above my $120 limit, and I'm aiming to get as close to that as possible.
* **Leverage:**  I still have the option to buy from John for $120, which gives me some negotiating power."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about $110? I think that's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm moving closer to the middle ground between her offer of $140 and my previous offer of $100.
* **Strategic Increase:** I'm only increasing my offer by $10 to show that I'm willing to negotiate, but also signaling that I'm getting closer to my limit.
* **Simplicity:** I'm keeping my message simple and to the point, focusing on the price and avoiding unnecessary details that could complicate the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's split the difference again and call it $125. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** $125 is just slightly above my $120 limit, but it's unlikely Alice will go any lower.
* **Final Offer:** She stated this is her final offer, so pushing further might make her walk away.
* **Saving Something:** It's better to get the product for $125 than to risk losing the deal and having to pay John's full price of $120."
