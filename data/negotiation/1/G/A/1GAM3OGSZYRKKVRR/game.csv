"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I really like the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value I'm sure you'll get from the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,800 for the product. Can we meet in the middle?",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $8,800 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000?  I think that's a fair compromise and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,800 is still too low for me. Let's compromise again â€“ I'm willing to drop to $9,200. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you.  Let's make this deal happen!",9200.0,Alice,7,
