"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's offer is quite high. It makes sense to negotiate further and see if I can get a lower price closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $9,500 is a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaving room for negotiation. This strategy aims to understand Alice's flexibility and potentially secure a great deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is too far below my asking price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $8,500 is my final offer. It's still a great price for the value this product delivers. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice came down in price, but it's still above my ideal budget and what John is offering.  I'll try to meet her halfway and see if she's willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $7,750?"", 
""product_price"": 7750
}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to find a compromise. It's a reasonable increase from my previous offer and still allows for some potential savings compared to both Alice's current offer and John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us.  While I appreciate the compromise, $7,750 is still a bit low for me. Let's try $8,250.  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to go no lower. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unwilling to budge much further, and the difference is now relatively small. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation and potentially missing out on a good deal. John's offer of $8,000 is the safer and more financially sound option at this point."
