"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $9,500 is a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is too far below my asking price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $8,500 is my final offer. It's still a great price for the value this product delivers. Let me know if you're interested!",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us.  While I appreciate the compromise, $7,750 is still a bit low for me. Let's try $8,250.  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to go no lower. Let me know your thoughts.",8250.0,Alice,5,
