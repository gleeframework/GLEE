Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is higher than Bob's valuation of $80, but lower than your minimum price of $100. It gives Bob a little room for negotiation and incentivizes him to buy, while still securing you a decent profit. If he rejects, you can then sell to John for your minimum price."
