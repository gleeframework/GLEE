"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $11,500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm not willing to sell at that price, and there's still room for negotiation.  I will counter with a higher price in the next round, hoping to close the deal closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a great price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand we're both trying to find a fair deal. How about $9,750? That's a significant jump from my last offer, and it shows I'm serious about buying. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target price.  I believe there's still room to negotiate. I'll counter with a slightly higher offer in the next round, but I'm also getting closer to considering John's offer if I can't reach a mutually acceptable price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer.  How about we split the difference at $10,125?  That's a fair compromise, and it's still a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer. I'm willing to offer $9,900. This is a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still under my minimum price and we are approaching the halfway point of the negotiation rounds.  I am still confident that I can get a higher price, and will counter with a slightly higher offer in the next round. However, with the decreasing number of rounds remaining, the offer from John becomes more tempting.  I'll need to carefully consider if it's worth risking losing the deal altogether to try and get a slightly higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're going in circles. Let's make one final push. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is my best offer. It's fair to both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the final few rounds, and it's getting risky to keep rejecting Bob's offers. My goal is to maximize profit, but I also need to be realistic about the chances of getting my desired price.  At this point, $10,000 is a reasonable compromise, especially considering John's offer of $12,000.  This final offer provides a good chance to close the deal and avoid the risk of selling to John instead."
