"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Could you consider meeting me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  However, $900,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,100,000. This reflects the true value of what's being offered.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. Would you consider $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
