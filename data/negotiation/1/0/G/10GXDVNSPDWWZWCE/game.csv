I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $9000. What do you think?,9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $9000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7500 for it.  What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $8250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $8250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8000, which is a fair compromise considering your original asking price. Let's finalize this deal at $8000.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm close to meeting you at $8000, but I'm not quite ready to give up on getting a bit more. I can offer it to you for $8200. This is my final concession, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're close to your bottom line, but I'm still not comfortable going above $8000. This product is valuable to me, but so is staying within my budget.  If you're serious about selling, I'm ready to close this deal at $8000 right now.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've made a significant concession, and I'm starting to feel like we're at an impasse. I'm willing to meet you at $8000, but I'd like to throw in a small sweetener to make it worth my while. I'll include a free accessory that's worth $200, which will bring the total value to $8200. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,7,
