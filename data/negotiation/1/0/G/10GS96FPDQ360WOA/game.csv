"I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can we meet in the middle at $1400000?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1400000 isn't quite where I need to be.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1600000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1500000, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your offer. However, $1500000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $1550000. It's a small step up, but I'm hoping we can close the deal.  What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm not willing to go up to $1550000. I'm still thinking $1500000 is a fair price. Can you meet me at $1525000?,1525000.0,Bob,6,
