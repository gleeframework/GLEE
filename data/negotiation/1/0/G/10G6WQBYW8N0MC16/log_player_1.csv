Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This allows for some negotiation room while still ensuring I don't sell below my minimum.  I'm confident I can make a profit if Bob negotiates, and if he doesn't, I can always move on to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a better price with a counteroffer.  I can always go to John if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my price slightly from Bob's offer, but still leaving room for negotiation. This keeps the pressure on Bob to increase his offer while still being within a reasonable range.  I'm confident I can get a higher price than Bob's initial offer but still lower than my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's latest offer is below my minimum acceptable price. Even though I'm making a small profit, it's not worth the time and effort to continue negotiating. I'm better off selling to John for my minimum acceptable price and ending the negotiation with Bob."
