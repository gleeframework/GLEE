Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a good starting point, as it's above Bob's value but still leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'm prepared to counter-offer, but I'll also keep John in mind as a backup buyer at $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm counter-offering at $105. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my last offer. It's still a bit above his value, but hopefully, it's tempting enough to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $95 is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not enough. At this point, John is a safer option, as he's willing to pay my minimum price. I'll sell to John and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
