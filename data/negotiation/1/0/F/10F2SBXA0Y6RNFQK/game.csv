"Alice, thanks for the offer. It's a great start, but $1800000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to be honest, I was expecting a bit more enthusiasm for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can offer it to you for $1600000. That's my best and final concession for now.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1600000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to go up to $1550000, which is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this.",1550000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I can see you're really pushing hard to get a good deal, and I respect that. However, I still need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I can meet you at $1580000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a compromise, but I think it's the best we can do. What do you think?",1580000.0,Alice,5,
