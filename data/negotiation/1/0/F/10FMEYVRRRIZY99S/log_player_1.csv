Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum price, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

While I'm happy to sell to John for $8,000, I want to see if I can get a little more from Bob.  I'm going to reject his offer and see what counteroffer he makes."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $9,000. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully it will be appealing enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has increased his offer slightly. While it's still below my desired price, it's only $200 less than what John is offering. It's not worth risking another round of negotiation with Bob, so I'll accept his offer and sell the product to him for $8,200."
