"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in this product,  $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'm proposing a new price of $1,075,000.
