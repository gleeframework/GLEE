"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in this product,  $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'm proposing a new price of $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
