Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate the value it brings. I would like to propose a price of $80 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $80, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price of $95. I'll see if I can get Bob to budge a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50?  I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate the adjustment. I would like to counter with a price of $85 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $85 is a good deal and gets me closer to my minimum desired price of $80. I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely and having to sell to John for $80."
