"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're bringing to the table, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the value it brings to your business.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than I can afford right now.  I'm prepared to pay $11,000, which would be a fair price for both of us. Let's close the deal at this price.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $11,500. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $11,250. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the value it brings to your business.",11250.0,Alice,5,
