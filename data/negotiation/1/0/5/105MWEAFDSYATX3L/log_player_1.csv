Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $140. It's a steal considering its value, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $140, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves some room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm not setting a hardline price, which allows for flexibility in the negotiation.
* **Safety Net:** I have John as a backup buyer at $150, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested but my budget is a bit tighter than that.  Would you be willing to go down to $125? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $125 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum of $150. Selling to John guarantees me that amount. 
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe I can still get closer to my target price through further negotiation. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter-offer and potentially secure a better price. 
* **Risk Assessment:** Selling to John is the safest option, but I'm willing to take a calculated risk to see if I can get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While I'm willing to negotiate further, $125 is a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $135. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll still get a great deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a compromise by meeting Bob halfway at $135. This shows I'm flexible but still firm on my bottom line.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to maintain a good rapport with Bob and make him feel valued.
* **Reiterate Value:** I remind Bob that he's getting a good deal even at $135, highlighting the product's worth. 
* **Strategic Counter:** This counteroffer is strategically placed to gauge Bob's willingness to pay more while staying within my price range."
