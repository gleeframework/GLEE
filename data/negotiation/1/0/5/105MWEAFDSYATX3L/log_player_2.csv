"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $140. It's a steal considering its value, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget of $120. You can do better by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested but my budget is a bit tighter than that.  Would you be willing to go down to $125? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While I'm willing to negotiate further, $125 is a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $135. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll still get a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $135 is still above your maximum budget of $120.  It's better to go with the guaranteed price from John and avoid further negotiation."
