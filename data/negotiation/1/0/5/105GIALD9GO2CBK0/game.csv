"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to acquire my product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're making progress, Alice. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $1,100,000. That's the highest I can go.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything less than $1,175,000. This is my final offer.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best price for your product, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $1,150,000, but that's as high as I can go. Please consider it my final offer.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
