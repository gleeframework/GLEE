Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring Bob is likely to accept. 

* **Why 12,000?**
    * It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
    * It leaves room for Bob to still get a good deal, as the product is worth $15,000 to him.
    * It's likely to be attractive enough for Bob to accept, rather than risk losing out and you selling to John for $10,000.

**Reasoning:**

This strategy utilizes a key concept in negotiation: **the zone of possible agreement (ZOPA).**  The ZOPA is the range between your minimum acceptable price and Bob's maximum acceptable price. By offering $12,000, you're within the ZOPA, making a deal more likely."
