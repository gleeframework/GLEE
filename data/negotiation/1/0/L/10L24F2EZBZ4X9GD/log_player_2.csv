It's always worth exploring options, and $1,000,000 is a good starting point, but I can likely do better. Let's see if we can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see if Alice is serious about selling. This price is a good starting point for negotiation, as it leaves room for both of us to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice is coming down, but I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I'll counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm going to raise my offer slightly. It's still below Alice's latest offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise. This keeps the negotiation moving forward."
