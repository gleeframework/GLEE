"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. My asking price is $115. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $105? That would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $105 is a good deal for me. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $100? That's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to pay $100. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $95 and $100, so I'd be willing to pay $97.50 for the product.",97.5,Bob,6,
