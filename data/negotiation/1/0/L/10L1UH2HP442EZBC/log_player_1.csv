Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I believe it would be valuable to you. I'm offering it at $20,000."", ""product_price"": 20000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate down and still achieve a good outcome. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** By starting at $20,000, I can get a sense of how interested Bob is and how much he might be willing to pay. 
* **Alternative Option:** I always have John's offer of $15,000 as a safety net, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Low:** Bob's offer of $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still a gap between his offer and my minimum, indicating room for negotiation.
* **John as Backup:** I'm not desperate to accept a low offer because I have John's offer of $15,000 as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is quite high, and $12,000 is considerably below what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** By countering, I demonstrate willingness to negotiate.
* **Significant Drop:** Coming down from $20,000 to $17,000 is a substantial concession, showing Bob I'm serious about making a deal. 
* **Still Above Minimum:** This counteroffer keeps me well above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Encourages Compromise:**  The ""meet in the middle"" phrasing aims to encourage Bob to make a counteroffer closer to my target range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $15,000. Would you be willing to consider $14,500? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but Not Enough:** Bob's offer of $14,500 is close to my minimum of $15,000, but it's still below what I'm willing to accept.
* **Budget Constraint:** Bob has explicitly mentioned a budget constraint, making it less likely he'll significantly increase his offer.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  John's offer of $15,000 is guaranteed and meets my minimum acceptable price. It makes more sense to take the sure thing than to continue negotiating with Bob for a potentially small gain."
