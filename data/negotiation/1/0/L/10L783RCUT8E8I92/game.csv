"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I think you'll find it's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $13,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,500.  This is a fair price considering your product's value to you and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,200. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and my minimum price of $12,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",13200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,200 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $12,750. This is a fair price that's closer to both of our desired outcomes. I'm confident we can reach an agreement on this price.",12750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your point, Bob, and I'm willing to consider your proposal. However, I'm not ready to give up on the extra $250 yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'll sell the product to you for $13,050. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",13050.0,Alice,5,
