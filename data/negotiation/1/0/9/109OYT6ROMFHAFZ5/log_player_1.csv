Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $125. I believe it's a great deal and will be valuable to you."", 
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while staying above our minimum acceptable price ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $125 allows room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a price higher than $100.
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing we have a guaranteed sale at $150 gives us leverage. We don't need to desperately lowball Bob.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between enticing Bob and securing a profit above our minimum."
