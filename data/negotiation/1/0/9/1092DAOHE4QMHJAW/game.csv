"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 feels a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $90?",90.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,105.0
"I understand that $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we settle on $95? That seems like a reasonable compromise to me.",95.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,110.0
"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still think $95 is a bit low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. How about we try $107.50? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",107.5,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to offer $97.50, but I need to be upfront â€“ that's the absolute highest I can go. If we can't agree on this, I might have to consider other options.",97.5,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,110.0
"I understand that you've reached your limit, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $110. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum. How about we try $109? That's the lowest I can go.",109.0,Alice,7,,
