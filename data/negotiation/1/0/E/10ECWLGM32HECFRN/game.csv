"Alice, $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell it to you for $10,500. This is the best I can do.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $9,750. This would be a fair deal for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,750. I can meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,250. This is the lowest I can go.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,250 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,900. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",9900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to reach an agreement, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth it. I can sell it to you for $10,000, which is the same price I offered in Round 1. This is my final offer.",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,000 is still more than I can pay. I'm willing to offer $9,800.  This is my final offer, let's make this deal!",9800.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not going to budge any further, Bob. I've already made concessions and this is my final offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,500, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",10500.0,Alice,9,
