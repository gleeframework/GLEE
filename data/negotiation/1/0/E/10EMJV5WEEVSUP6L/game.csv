"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,000,000 is significantly lower than the value I place on the product.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $1,250,000? It's a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
