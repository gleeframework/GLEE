"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it allows for negotiation and gives me a good starting point. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to secure a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $15,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves some room for negotiation.  I believe this price is fair, considering my minimum acceptable price and the fact that Bob is clearly interested in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,500 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer and is closer to my desired price point.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
