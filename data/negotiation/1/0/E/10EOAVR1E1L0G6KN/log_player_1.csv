Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $15,000.  Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I know Bob values the product at $10,000, starting with a higher price ($15,000) creates room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  The message implies the product is worth the higher price without explicitly stating it's worth more to Bob than his perceived value.
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone is suggestive rather than demanding, leaving room for Bob to counter-offer.
* **Backup plan:** I'm comfortable with the risk that Bob might reject the offer because I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize profit while keeping Bob engaged in the process."
