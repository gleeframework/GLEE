"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $9,500. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $9,500 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Can you consider my offer?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  It's still a great deal for a product of this quality. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $8,800 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,200?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be very happy with this product.",9200.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm getting a little tired of going back and forth. $8,900 is still too low for me. I'm going to stick to my price of $9,100. If you're serious about buying, this is the best I can do.  Let me know.",9100.0,Alice,7,
