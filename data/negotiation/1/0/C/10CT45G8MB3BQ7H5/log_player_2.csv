"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $11,000 is fair.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a good price, it's still higher than what the product is worth to Alice.  There's room for negotiation, so it's better to reject and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500, which is still a good deal for you, considering what the product is worth to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above Alice's value for the product.  This gives Alice room to negotiate while still making a profit.  It's a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? It's a competitive price that still acknowledges the value you'll be getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $10,250 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. There's still room for negotiation, and  Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,250 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that's closer to Alice's counteroffer, but still below it.  This shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but is still trying to get the best possible price. This offer gives Alice a chance to accept and avoid further negotiation, or reject and potentially lose the deal if Bob decides to buy from John."
