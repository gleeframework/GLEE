"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500, which is still a good deal for you, considering what the product is worth to you.  What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? It's a competitive price that still acknowledges the value you'll be getting.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,250 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.",10000.0,Bob,4,
