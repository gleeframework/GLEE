"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $175 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $100.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit out of my price range.  I'd be willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting his negotiation by offering the absolute minimum he's willing to pay. This establishes a clear boundary and puts pressure on Alice to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about $140?  That's a good price for both of us, and we can close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his $100 limit.  He can continue to negotiate and see if he can get Alice closer to his price point.  There are still many rounds left, so he doesn't need to rush into a deal that's not beneficial to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $140 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $110.  This is a fair price for both of us, and lets us close the deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $110, showing flexibility. This is a reasonable compromise, as he is still below his budget. This also gives Alice an incentive to accept, as she is closer to her target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is a reasonable compromise, and we can finally finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still determined to get the product for as close to his $100 budget as possible. While $125 is getting closer, it's still above his target.  There are still several rounds left, so he can keep negotiating and try to get a better deal. He can also still purchase from John for $100 if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $115. This is a fair compromise, and we can close the deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again increasing his offer slightly, to $115, to show flexibility and willingness to meet halfway. This offer is still within his budget and represents a further compromise, potentially encouraging Alice to accept. He continues to push for a better price while keeping in mind that he can still buy from John if negotiations fail."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference and settle on $120?  I think this is a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still determined to get the product for as close to his $100 budget as possible. While $120 is getting closer, it's still above his target.  There are only a few rounds left, but he can keep negotiating and try to get a better deal. He can also still purchase from John for $100 if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy we're getting close, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $118.  Let's close this deal with a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 118}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a final push for a better price, increasing his offer to $118. This is a compromise, showing that he's serious about closing the deal while still trying to save money.  He's also making it clear that he's willing to walk away and buy from John if Alice doesn't accept his final offer."
