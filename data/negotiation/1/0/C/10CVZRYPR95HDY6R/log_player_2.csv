"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects its value while giving you a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to start the counteroffer process and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000. This would be a great deal for both of us, as you'd still be making a profit, and I'd be getting a fantastic product at a price I'm comfortable with."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer you the product for $11500. This is a fair price that gives you a good deal while ensuring I make a reasonable profit.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still looking to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a better offer than the initial $13,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should reject the offer and try to get closer to his desired price of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. How about $11,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal at that amount."", ""product_price"": 11000}
