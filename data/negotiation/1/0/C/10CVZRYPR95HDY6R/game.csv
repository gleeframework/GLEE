"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10000. This would be a great deal for both of us, as you'd still be making a profit, and I'd be getting a fantastic product at a price I'm comfortable with.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer you the product for $11500. This is a fair price that gives you a good deal while ensuring I make a reasonable profit.  What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11500 is still a bit high for me. How about $11000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal at that amount.",11000.0,Bob,4,
