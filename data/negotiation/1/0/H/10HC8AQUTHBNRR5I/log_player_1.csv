Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you have significant leverage. Starting high allows room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value is even higher than the asking price, aiming to influence Bob's perception.
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone remains open for discussion, inviting Bob to counter-offer and engage in the negotiation.

By starting high, Alice maximizes her potential gain while still leaving room to reach a deal with Bob."
