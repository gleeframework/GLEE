"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point, as it's higher than the product's worth to Bob, but not so high that it immediately scares him off.  I'm hoping to maximize my profit, but also want to keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm happy with the $12,000 offer, I believe I can still do better. I'm going to try and counter-offer him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm counter-offering Bob at $13,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves some room for profit. I'm hoping this will be appealing enough for Bob to accept, while also maintaining some leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  Although it's only $500 more than what I would get from John, I'm starting to feel the pressure of time.  I've only got 6 rounds left, and if we keep going back and forth, I might not be able to secure a better deal before my other options disappear.  It's important to be practical and recognize that a slightly higher profit is better than risking getting nothing at all."
