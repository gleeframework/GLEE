"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $750000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $825000. This is the best I can do at this time. What are your thoughts?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $775000 for the product. Is that something you'd consider?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $775000. I'm willing to compromise again, so I'm counteroffering at $815000. This is my final offer for now. What are your thoughts?",815000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm not willing to meet you at $800500. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $810000. This is my last offer before considering other options.",810000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your last concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $810000. I'd be willing to go up to $795000, but no higher. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",795000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit far apart, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $805000. This is my absolute final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",805000.0,Alice,9,
