{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm trying to maximize my profit while keeping the deal appealing to Bob. It's slightly higher than his perceived value, giving him a small incentive to buy. If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly, always keeping in mind the potential sale to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $14000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to come down to $13000? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum value of $15,000. However, his willingness to negotiate shows there's potential.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I understand your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  How about $13,500? It's a fair compromise that shows I'm willing to work with you. Let's find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm offering a counteroffer slightly higher than Bob's proposal, but still lower than my ideal price. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and encourages further negotiation, potentially leading to a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13250? I think that's a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum value.  I've reached a point where further negotiation with Bob seems unlikely to yield a price I'm comfortable with.  Selling to John for $15,000 ensures I meet my minimum value and avoids further potential negotiation."
