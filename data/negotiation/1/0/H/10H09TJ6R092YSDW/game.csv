"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $14000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to come down to $13000? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. I understand your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  How about $13500? It's a fair compromise that shows I'm willing to work with you. Let's find a solution that benefits us both.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13250? I think that's a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal.",13250.0,Bob,4,
