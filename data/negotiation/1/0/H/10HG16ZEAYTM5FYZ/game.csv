"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $10,500 is still a bit out of my range. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $9,500. This is my final offer.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $9,500, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again and offer it to you for $10,250. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",10250.0,Alice,5,
