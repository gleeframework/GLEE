"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You are trying to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit high for me. How about $105? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $105 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110?  I'm confident you'll be happy with this product, and I'm sure we can find a mutually agreeable price.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You are still trying to get the best possible price. While $110 is better than $115, you are still closer to your ideal price of $105.  Rejecting and counteroffering again keeps the negotiation moving towards a price you are happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle again at $107.50? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 107.50}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $107.50 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try $109.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You've been making steady progress in the negotiation. $109 is only $4 more than your ideal price and closer to Alice's asking price.  It's likely Alice won't budge further and you risk reaching the 10-round limit, forcing you to buy from John for $120.  Accepting this offer is the best course of action."
