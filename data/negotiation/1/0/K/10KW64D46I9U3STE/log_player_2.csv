"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that could greatly benefit you. Considering its value, I propose a price of $110 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
```
Reason:Alice's starting price of $110 is close to my maximum but still leaves room for negotiation. I'll counteroffer with a lower price to see if I can get a better deal. 
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price of $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 
```
Reason: I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still within a reasonable range. This gives me room to negotiate up while aiming for a price well below my $120 limit. 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial price. How about considering $95 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

```
Reason: While $95 is a better price, I still have room to negotiate.  I'll counteroffer slightly below her price to see if I can get it even lower.
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $92?"",
""product_price"": 92
}
``` 

```
Reason: Alice moved down in price, showing she's willing to negotiate. My counteroffer is a compromise, aiming for a price that benefits both of us. 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Bob. Considering the value of the product, I would like to suggest $93 as the price for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $93
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

```
Reason: $93 is a great price, well below my $120 limit and only slightly above Alice's last offer. It's unlikely I'll get a much better deal by continuing to negotiate.
