I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1200000, and I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to get a better return on my investment. Considering the product's worth to you is $1200000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $850000. This is a reasonable compromise that should benefit both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
