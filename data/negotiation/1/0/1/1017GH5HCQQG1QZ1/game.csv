"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm interested, but  $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I can see you're serious about the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,200.
