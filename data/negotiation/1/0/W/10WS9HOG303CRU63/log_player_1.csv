Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Above Minimum:**  This price is significantly above my $10,000 minimum, ensuring a good profit even if Bob negotiates down slightly. 
* **Alternative Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'm still guaranteed a sale at $10,000 to John, so there's no risk of losing money."
