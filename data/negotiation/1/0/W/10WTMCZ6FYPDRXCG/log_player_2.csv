"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $2,300,000 is far beyond your budget of $800,000. It's clear that we need to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows us to make a counteroffer and hopefully find a price that works for both parties."

{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to spend.  Considering the value to me, I'm offering $800,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  I'm willing to negotiate, so I'm proposing a revised price of $1,900,000. This offer reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,900,000 is still too high for my budget.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to get her closer to my target price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 is closer to a realistic figure, it's still below my bottom line. To meet you halfway, I'm proposing a final offer of $1,450,000.  This offer reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has continued to come down in price, $1,450,000 is still above my budget of $800,000.  At this point, it's clear that we won't be able to agree on a price.  I'm going to buy the product from John for $800,000, which is within my budget."
