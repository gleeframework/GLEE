Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $15,000, giving you significant room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $12,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly while still securing a great deal for yourself. 
* **Above John's Offer:** This price is significantly higher than John's offer of $8,000, ensuring a better profit if Bob accepts.
* **Direct and Clear:**  The message is straightforward, highlighting the product's value and offering a clear price point.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit by leveraging your understanding of Bob's valuation while still leaving a possibility for a mutually beneficial agreement."
