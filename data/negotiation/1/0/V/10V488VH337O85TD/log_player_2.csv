"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  $950,000 is still too high, and you can potentially get a better deal."

Alice's offer:

I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value it holds for me.

$900,000 is still too high for Bob. He should reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  He can still get a better deal than this with a little more haggling."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $890,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope you can see the value in the product at this price.

While $890,000 is closer to your goal, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  It's worth trying to push for a lower price, as Alice has already made concessions. You could try one more counteroffer and then go with John if that fails."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $880,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $895,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope you can see the value in the product at this price.

While $895,000 is tempting, it's still higher than the price John is offering. It's time to cut your losses and go with John. You've already put in a lot of effort negotiating with Alice, and at this point, it's clear she's unwilling to go any lower.  Saving $95,000 is worth it."
