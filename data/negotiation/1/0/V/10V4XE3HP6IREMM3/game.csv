"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further.  How about $8,500?  This gives you a good deal and still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $8,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $7,500. Would that work for you?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate.  However, $7,500 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $8,000, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested. If not, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",8000.0,Alice,5,
