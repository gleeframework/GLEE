"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $110 is better than $120, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  How about we meet in the middle at $95?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his target of $80, while still being within the negotiation range. Offering $95 demonstrates a willingness to compromise, but keeps the pressure on Alice to come down a bit more."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $105. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal on a high-quality product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is closer to Bob's goal, he can still try to get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a deal closer to his target of $80.  There are still 7 rounds left, giving Bob room to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $95.  It's a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his previous counteroffer of $95.  He's demonstrated a willingness to compromise, and reiterating this offer shows he's serious about getting a fair deal.  He's also emphasizing the mutual benefit of closing the deal, hoping to encourage Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you halfway between $105 and $95, which is $100. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal on a high-quality product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price. Accepting Alice's offer at $100 would give Bob a good deal and save him $20 compared to buying from John. At this point, continuing to negotiate risks running out of rounds and being forced to buy from John at a higher price."
