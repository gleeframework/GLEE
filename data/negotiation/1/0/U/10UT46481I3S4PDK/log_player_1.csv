To start, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This reflects the value I place on the product, but I'm open to discussing a fair price.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1,100,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

This would still allow me to recoup my investment, and it's a significant value for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
