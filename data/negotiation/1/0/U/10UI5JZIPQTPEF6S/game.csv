"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is fair given its value to both of us. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This price reflects the product's value to you and allows us both to make a profitable deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $875,000, which is a fair compromise that meets us halfway.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 still isn't quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $890,000, which is a fair price considering the value you'll receive. This is my final offer, let's see if we can close this deal.",890000.0,Alice,5,
