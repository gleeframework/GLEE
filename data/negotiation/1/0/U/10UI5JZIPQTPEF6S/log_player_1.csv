Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is fair given its value to both of us. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $875,000, which is a fair compromise that meets us halfway.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.
