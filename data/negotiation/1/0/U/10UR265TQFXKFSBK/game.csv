"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150.",150.0,Alice,1,,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120.",120.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,140.0
"I understand that $120 is a bit tight for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $140, which is a great deal considering the value of the product. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $125, but that's as high as I can go.",125.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,135.0
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $140, so I'll offer you $132.50. This is the lowest I'm willing to go.",132.5,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $132.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $130, and that's my final offer. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $100.",130.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,135.0
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $135, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you at $130, but I need to make a bit more than that to make it worth my while. I'll make a final offer of $132.50, and that's as low as I can go.",132.5,Alice,7,,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,
"I've already made a counteroffer of $130, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm willing to walk away and buy the product from John for $100 if we can't come to an agreement.",130.0,Bob,8,,
