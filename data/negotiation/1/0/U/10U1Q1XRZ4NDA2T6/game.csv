"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $2,000,000 represents its full value, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  I believe this price reflects a fair compromise.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,750,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this price is more in line with my expectations.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
