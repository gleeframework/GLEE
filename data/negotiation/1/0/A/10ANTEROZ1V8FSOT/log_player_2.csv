"Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer of $700,000 is a good deal, it's still possible to get a better price by continuing the negotiation. There's a good chance Alice is willing to go lower, and Bob has nothing to lose by trying."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 650000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal and willing to push for a lower price.  It's a strong starting point for negotiation while still being realistic and potentially acceptable to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is slightly better than her initial offer, but still not as good as the price Bob wants. Since Bob is determined to get the best possible price, he should reject this offer and try to negotiate further.  There's still a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 675000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to slowly close the gap between his desired price and Alice's asking price.  By raising his counteroffer by $25,000, he shows Alice that he is serious about buying the product but still wants a better deal.  This strategy keeps the negotiation moving forward and might lead to a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to what Bob is willing to pay, but it's still not ideal. There's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price and see if Alice is willing to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer brings Bob's offer up to $700,000, which is a significant increase from his previous offer. This shows Alice that he is serious about buying the product and is willing to meet her halfway. It's a calculated risk, but it could lead to a quick agreement and save time. If Alice rejects this offer, it might be time to consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now at $725,000, which is only $25,000 more than Bob's last counteroffer. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are minimal. It's likely that continuing negotiations would take more time and energy, and the final price might not be significantly lower.  Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most practical decision. It secures a good deal without risking a lengthy negotiation that might not yield a much better price.  Bob can still save $75,000 compared to buying from John."
