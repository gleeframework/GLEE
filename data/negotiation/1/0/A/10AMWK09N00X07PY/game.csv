"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I'm proposing $1,400,000. This reflects its worth while acknowledging your interest.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, $1,400,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Could we agree on $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be fair, $900,000 is too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  I believe this reflects a fair compromise, considering its value.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,6,
