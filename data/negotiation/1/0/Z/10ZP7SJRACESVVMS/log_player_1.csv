Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $80. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher price.  I'll be ready to counter-offer if he rejects this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than my minimum of $150.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range, and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm proposing $160, which is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. This allows me to potentially earn a decent profit while also giving Bob a fair price considering his valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $140 is just above my minimum of $150, making it the best option for me. It's a good compromise, considering the back-and-forth negotiation.  Selling to John for $150 would only be slightly better, and there's no guarantee that I can secure a higher price in future rounds with Bob."
