Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring Alice makes a significant profit. 
* **Avoid Alienating Bob:**  Going too close to $15,000 might make Bob feel like he has no room to negotiate and could cause him to walk away. 
* **Secure a Good Deal:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale to John for $12,000. This offer aims to get a better outcome without jeopardizing the fallback option."
