Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. I think that's a fair price considering its potential worth to your specific needs."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, I need to aim for a price higher than that with Bob to make a bigger profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $950,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation with Bob. He might counter-offer, and we could potentially settle on a price between $950,000 and $1,000,000.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob specifically, increasing the chance he'll be willing to pay a premium compared to its objective worth. 
 
**Important Note:** This strategy assumes I have no pressing need to sell the product immediately. If I need the cash quickly, selling to John for the guaranteed $1,000,000 is the safer option."
