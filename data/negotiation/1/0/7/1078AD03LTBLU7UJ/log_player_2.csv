Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10,000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,375

We are now getting into the territory of diminishing returns.  Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but it's unlikely she'll move much further. Accepting at $10,375 secures a significant saving compared to John's $15,000 price."
