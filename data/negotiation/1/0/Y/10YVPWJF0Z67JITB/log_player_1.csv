Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is still beneficial for both of us.  It leaves room for negotiation and potentially reaches a higher price while still staying above my minimum value.  This strategy is designed to maximize my profit while still leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I'm confident I can get closer to my target price of $13,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,000? That way, we both get a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $11000. How about we meet in the middle at $11500? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is a good compromise.  It's above my minimum of $10,000 and gets me closer to my target price of $13,000.  While I'd prefer to get a bit more,  it's important to balance getting a good price with the risk of him walking away or me having to settle for the lower offer from John."
