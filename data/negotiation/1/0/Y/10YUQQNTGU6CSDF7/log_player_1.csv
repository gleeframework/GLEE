"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a little high for me. How about $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I have 8 rounds left to try and get a better deal with Bob, and I don't want to give up too quickly."
