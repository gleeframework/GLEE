{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can go from there."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing the walk-away point:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 with John, so you absolutely won't accept anything less from Bob.
* **Aiming high but reasonably:** Starting at $1,150,000 allows room for negotiation while staying above your minimum. Bob might value the product enough to pay a premium over his $1,000,000 valuation, especially if you highlight its unique benefits.
* **Leaving room for Bob to counter:** A direct approach might seem too aggressive. Giving Bob space to respond allows him to feel involved in the process and potentially offer a counter-proposal closer to your desired price."
