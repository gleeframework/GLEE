{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Initial Offer:** I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000, which is $250,000 higher than the product's value to Bob. 
* **Message:** My message is friendly and emphasizes the fair value of the product for Bob.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I'm leaving room for negotiation, but I'm starting high to maximize my potential profit. I'll be prepared to counteroffer if Bob rejects my initial offer.
* **John as Backup:** The fact that John is willing to pay $1,500,000 gives me a safety net. I can always walk away from the negotiation with Bob if his counteroffers aren't satisfactory."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. How about we discuss a price of $1,600,000? I hope this proposal is within your considerations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,600,000 is closer to my minimum desired price of $1,500,000, but it's still not ideal. I'm aiming for a higher price.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,700,000.  I'm willing to compromise a bit, let's meet in the middle at $1,650,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1650000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm counteroffering at $1,650,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $1,750,000 and Bob's offer of $1,600,000.
* **Message:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone while expressing my desire for a higher price. I'm also framing the offer as a compromise to show I'm willing to be flexible. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving towards a potential deal while still aiming for a price closer to my initial target. 

I'm confident that this counteroffer will incentivize Bob to consider a higher price while remaining within his budget.  I'm also prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've reviewed your latest offer and while it's a step in the right direction, I'm still looking for a price closer to my budget. Considering the value of the product and my financial situation, how about we aim for $1,625,000? I hope this proposal will be more acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,625,000 is very close to my desired price point.  While I would prefer a bit more, it's only $25,000 below my last counteroffer and a significant improvement over his initial offer. Given the risk of further negotiation dragging on or potentially leading to a lower price, I'm going to accept his offer to secure the sale."
