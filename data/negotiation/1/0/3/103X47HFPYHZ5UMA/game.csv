"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it's worth $1,050,000 to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $1,050,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. We understand your position, but we're unable to meet you halfway at $950,000. Considering the value of the product, let's propose $1,000,000 as a new midpoint. This still gives us some room to negotiate while respecting your budget constraints.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,000,000 is still outside my comfort zone. Let's try $975,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to move towards a deal.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your proposal. We've considered your offer carefully, and we'd like to suggest $985,000 as a new midpoint. This is a slight adjustment from our previous offer, aiming for a fair compromise that respects both of our positions.",985000.0,Alice,5,
