"Round 1

# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it's worth $1,050,000 to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We understand your position, but we're unable to meet you halfway at $950,000. Considering the value of the product, let's propose $1,000,000 as a new midpoint. This still gives us some room to negotiate while respecting your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,000,000 is still outside my comfort zone. Let's try $975,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to move towards a deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your proposal. We've considered your offer carefully, and we'd like to suggest $985,000 as a new midpoint. This is a slight adjustment from our previous offer, aiming for a fair compromise that respects both of our positions.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $985,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $985,000 is within Bob's budget of $1,200,000. 
* It's a good deal for Bob as he's getting a decent discount from the original offer.
* While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of Alice rejecting and leaving Bob with only the option to buy from John at a higher price."
