"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While I see the value in the product, $14,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could we consider $7,000?"", ""product_price"": 7000}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try this - $12,000 and we have a deal. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but her ""final offer"" of $12,000 is still significantly higher than John's offer of $8,000. It's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and risking further negotiation might not yield a significantly better outcome.  Buying from John guarantees the best price and avoids potential negotiation fatigue."
