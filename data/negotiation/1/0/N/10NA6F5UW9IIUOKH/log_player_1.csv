While $95 is closer, it's still below my minimum. I'll keep pushing for a better price."

Round 6

Bob's offer of $100 is the same as what John is willing to pay.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John, there's no need to risk further negotiation with Bob. I'll take the safe option and sell to John."
