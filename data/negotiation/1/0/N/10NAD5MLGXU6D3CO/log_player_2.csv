"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe we can come to an agreement at a price of $9,500. This is a special offer tailored just for you, considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. There are more rounds of negotiation, so Bob should try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the special consideration. While I value the product, $9,500 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:**  Bob starts with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, dropping the price significantly. This shows Alice that he's serious about getting a good deal.
* **Justification:**  He provides a brief explanation, acknowledging the product's value but reiterating his budget constraints.
* **Openness:** The message ends with a question, inviting further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value of the product to both of us, how about we aim for a price of $9,000? I believe this strikes a good balance between our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Target:** Alice's counteroffer of $9,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price point. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** There are still several rounds of negotiation left.  Bob can likely get a lower price by continuing to counter.
* **No Urgent Need:**  Since Bob can always buy from John for $10,000, there's no immediate pressure to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,000 is still outside my budget. I'm happy to meet in the middle at $8,750. This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Compromise:**  Bob is willing to move slightly from his previous offer, showing he's engaging in the negotiation.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** He suggests a price halfway between his previous offer and Alice's current offer. This creates a sense of fairness and makes his counteroffer seem reasonable. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message maintains a polite and professional tone, keeping the negotiation open and positive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see your point, Bob. Let's try to find a common ground. How does a price of $8,900 sound to you? It's slightly above your last offer but below mine, aiming for a fair solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Alice's offer of $8,900 is very close to Bob's desired price point.  
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 5 rounds left, the risk of getting a better deal is decreasing.  
* **Value of the Product:** Bob values the product enough that paying $8,900 is still a good deal compared to buying from John. 
* **Potential for Future Negotiation:**  Even if Bob accepts, he could potentially negotiate a better price for future purchases if he continues to work with Alice."
