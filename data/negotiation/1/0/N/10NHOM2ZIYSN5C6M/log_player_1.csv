"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal and a valuable asset.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $8000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is lower than my minimum, it's still close enough that I can potentially negotiate a better deal.  I'm going to try to meet him halfway and see if we can close the gap.  Selling to John is always an option, but I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $8,000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to see if we can reach an agreement.  This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 8500}
