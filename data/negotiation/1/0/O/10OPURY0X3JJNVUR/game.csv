"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $18000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8000 at this time. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value I place on the product.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $12000, which is a compromise that I'm comfortable with. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9500. This is a significant step up from my previous offer and shows my genuine interest in acquiring the product. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",9500.0,Bob,4,
