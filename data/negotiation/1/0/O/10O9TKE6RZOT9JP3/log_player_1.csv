Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. My starting offer is $12,000. Let's talk!"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I want to see if I can get a higher price from Bob.  $10,000 is still below my minimum, but it's a starting point for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our potential partnership, $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $11,000?  That gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want a fair price, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John. $10,500 is closer to my minimum, but I want to see if I can get Bob to go a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you. $10,500 is a good offer, but I'm just a little bit away from accepting.  How about $10,750?  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
