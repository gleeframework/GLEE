"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that's worth a great deal to me, and I believe it could be just as valuable to you. I'm willing to let it go for a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but I need to know if you're interested. Let's discuss a figure that works for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
