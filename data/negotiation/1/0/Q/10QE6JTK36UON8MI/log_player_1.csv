Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly message makes Bob more likely to engage in the negotiation.
* **Potential for Compromise:** The price is close enough to Bob's value that he might be willing to accept, but if not, I can still negotiate down further.
* **John as a Backup:**  Having John as a backup at $10,000 means I can walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I've done some research and I'm not sure if the product is worth more than that to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. Accepting would result in a significant loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, I can still negotiate with him. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:**  Having John's offer of $10,000 gives me a strong negotiating position. I can use it as a threat if Bob won't come closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer with Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's desire for a lower price but also demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Midpoint Approach:**  $9,000 is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counter-offer, showing a desire to meet in the middle.
* **Continuing the Dialogue:**  The message emphasizes a continued dialogue, making Bob feel more engaged in the negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Further Compromise:**  $9,000 is still higher than Bob's offer, leaving room for a potential compromise in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $8,000 is a fair price for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Line:** While $8,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than my desired outcome. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential for further negotiation is present, but the risk of further lowering the price is too high. I'm already close to my minimum, and continuing to negotiate might push me below that line.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer of $10,000 guarantees me a profit and meets my minimum requirement.  It's a safer and more predictable outcome.

By selling to John, I ensure a good profit and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob."
