Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects a competitive price point."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to maximize profit. Since she has a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, she wants to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product just below John's valuation ($11,999) creates a sense of urgency and perceived value for Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves a small margin for Bob to negotiate, potentially increasing Alice's profit slightly.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice cannot reveal she has another buyer. If she could, she might push the price closer to $12,000."
