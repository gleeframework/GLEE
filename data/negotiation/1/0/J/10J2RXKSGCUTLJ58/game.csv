"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for countering, Alice. I appreciate you working with me. While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a touch high. How about we settle at $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $7,500 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $8,500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",8500.0,Alice,5,
