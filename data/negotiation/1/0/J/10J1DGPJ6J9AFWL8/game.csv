"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $12000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it, considering the maximum value I'm willing to pay. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10000. This is a great compromise, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm firm on my offer of $8000. If you're not able to accept that, I'll have to look at other options.",8000.0,Bob,4,
