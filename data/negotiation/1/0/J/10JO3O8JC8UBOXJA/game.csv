"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for it, which is still a fair price considering my assessment of its value.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to sell it at that price. Considering the product's unique features and the value it can bring to your business, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a compromise that I hope you'll find acceptable. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $800000.  This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to reach an agreement.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,4,
