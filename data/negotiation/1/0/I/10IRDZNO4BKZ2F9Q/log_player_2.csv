"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $125. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $125 is a decent starting point, but there's room for bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $125 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** By offering $100, we're anchoring the negotiation closer to Alice's perceived value of the product. This gives us more room to negotiate upwards if needed.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is respectful of Alice's offer while clearly stating our desired price. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Alice's flexibility and willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $110? It's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for my product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Negotiation:** While $110 is better than the initial offer, it's still above our target price. Alice's willingness to negotiate suggests there might be room for further compromise.
* **Splitting the Difference:** A common negotiation tactic is to meet in the middle. Rejecting this offer opens the possibility of Alice counter-proposing with $105, which would be a good deal. 
* **Alternative Available:**  We always have the option to buy from John for $150, so we're not desperate to accept any offer from Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle at $105?"",
""product_price"": 105

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise and find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Strong Position:** We're still below our maximum budget and have presented a fair deal.  
* **Clear Objective:**  By explicitly suggesting a split, we make our intentions clear and simplify the negotiation."
