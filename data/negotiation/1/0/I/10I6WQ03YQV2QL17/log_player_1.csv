"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. I believe it's a fair price given its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than $175. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth at least $150 to Alice. Bob's offer of $120 is too low. It's better to reject and try to get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $160. This price still reflects the product's value while giving you a good opportunity. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is getting closer to Alice's minimum, it's still below her desired price. Alice can likely secure a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. $140 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $145. This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a great deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $135 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Alice has already made several concessions, and Bob's offer is still below her minimum. With only 4 rounds left, there's a high risk that the negotiation will drag on without a satisfactory result. Selling to John for $150 ensures a guaranteed profit and avoids further risk."
