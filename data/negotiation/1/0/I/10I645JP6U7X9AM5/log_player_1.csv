Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford right now.  Let me know if that's a price you can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $12,000 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $12,000 is significantly below what the product is worth to me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $16,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe this product will continue to be a valuable investment for your business."", ""product_price"": 16000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really only able to go up to $14,000. If you can meet me there, I'm ready to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $14,000 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is a fair price considering the value of this product.
