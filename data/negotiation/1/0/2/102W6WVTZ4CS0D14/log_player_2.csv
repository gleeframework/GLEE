"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $95. It's a great value considering its worth to you is $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

You can likely get a better price than $95, so it's worth negotiating further with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. How about $90 for the product?

While Alice has moved closer to your ideal price, you can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see your point, Bob. Let me propose $89 for the product. This is my final offer before considering other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice has come down to $89, which is a great price for you. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer, leaving you to buy from John at $100.  It's better to accept this offer and save money."
