"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $9,500. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is within Bob's budget, it's not the best deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $9,500 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the price as close to his $8,000 value as possible, but leaving room for negotiation. A $1,000 discount is significant, and it's a good starting point for bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my original asking price. How about $9,000? It's a fair compromise and I think we can both be happy with that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While $9,000 is closer to his desired price, he can still try to negotiate further. He can likely get the price down a bit more with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's increased his offer by $250, showing a willingness to meet Alice halfway.  This counteroffer is still below Alice's asking price, but it demonstrates that Bob is serious about making a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my original asking price.  How about $8,900?  It's a small increase from your offer, and it would be a fair compromise. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $8,900, which is only $100 more than Bob's last offer. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer or the negotiation stalling is high.  At this point, accepting the offer is the best option as it secures the product for a price within Bob's budget and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at a higher price."
