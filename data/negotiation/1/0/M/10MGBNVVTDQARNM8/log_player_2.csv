"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's beneficial to engage in negotiation to try and get a price closer to our budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering! That price is a little too high for me. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We start with a significantly lower offer than Alice's asking price to leave room for negotiation. This tactic aims to gauge her flexibility.
* **Within Budget:** The offer of $80 is well within our $100 budget.
* **Polite and Open:**  The message remains polite and expresses interest, fostering a positive negotiation environment."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $80 is too low for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  $140 is still significantly above our $100 budget. While Alice moved from her initial offer, it's not enough of a concession yet.
* **Negotiation Room:** We're only on Round 3, giving us ample time to try and negotiate a better price. 
* **Backup Option:**  We always have the safety net of buying from John at $100 if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand that $80 is a big drop from your initial price, Alice. How about we settle at $100? That's the absolute highest I can go."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We're being firm by stating our maximum budget of $100, but also aiming for fairness by meeting Alice halfway between her last offer ($140) and our previous offer ($80).
* **Deadline Pressure:**  While we have rounds left, introducing a sense of urgency might encourage Alice to accept our offer now.
* **Alternative Option:** By stating this is our maximum, we subtly remind Alice that we have the option to buy from John if necessary."
