"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Considering its worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000. This is a very competitive offer, given its potential value to you.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway and counter at $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
