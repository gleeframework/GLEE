Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to part with it for $150. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start with a higher price in negotiations. This leaves room for bargaining and makes Bob feel like he might be getting a better deal if he negotiates you down. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  By offering it at $150, we see how interested Bob really is. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, we haven't lost anything because we have John as a backup. 
* **Profit Maximization:** While we have a guaranteed $120 from John, aiming higher allows us to potentially earn a larger profit."
