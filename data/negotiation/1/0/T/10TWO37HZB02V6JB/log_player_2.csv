"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to us, but we're willing to start negotiations. Given its value to you, which is $80, let's aim for a fair price. How about we start at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $100 is too high for Bob.  He's willing to pay $80 at most.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $100 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to pay more. Considering the value of the product, we think it's worth a bit more than what we initially offered. How about we meet in the middle at $92? This respects both the value you place on the product and the value we assign to it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $92 is still too high for Bob. While it's closer to his desired price of $80, it's still more than he's willing to pay. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $92 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $88.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your response. We understand your position and would like to offer $90 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering its value to both of us. Please let us know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $90 is still too high for Bob.  While it's closer to his desired price of $80, it's still more than he's willing to pay. He's already been through a few rounds of negotiation, and it's clear that Alice is not willing to come down to his desired price. It's more beneficial to buy the product from John for $80, rather than continuing to negotiate with Alice."
