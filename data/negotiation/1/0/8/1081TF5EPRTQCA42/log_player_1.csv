Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a High Target:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $1,500,000 offer gives you room to negotiate down if Bob pushes back, while still potentially securing a significant profit.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value to justify the high price without revealing your absolute bottom line. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your approach based on Bob's response and any information you gather during your negotiation."
