"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is reflective of the immense benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Beginning with a price significantly higher than both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) provides room for negotiation. This allows you to gradually lower the price while gauging Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential,"" aiming to anchor Bob's perception at a higher level.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While the initial offer is high, it's essential to remain below John's guaranteed $1,500,000 offer. This ensures that if Bob outright rejects the offer and subsequent negotiations fail, you can still sell to John without a loss. 

This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit while acknowledging the possibility of a counteroffer or moving on to another buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is way above my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $1,000,000 at this time.  This is my best and final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is his perceived value, and he's framed it as ""best and final."" While this may be a negotiation tactic, accepting at this stage would mean a significant loss for you.  You have room to negotiate, and John's offer provides a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While that price doesn't reflect the true value of this product, I'm willing to negotiate. To find middle ground, I propose a revised price of $1,900,000. This considers its unique benefits and future potential."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** While still significantly higher than Bob's offer, this counteroffer shows a willingness to move from the initial price. This can signal that you are serious about finding a deal.
* **Anchoring High:**  By staying relatively high, you aim to keep Bob's expectations within a range that remains profitable for you.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message continues to highlight the product's ""unique benefits"" and ""future potential,"" subtly reinforcing its worth beyond Bob's initial perception. 

This approach keeps the negotiation active, aims for a higher settlement point, and leaves room for further adjustments in subsequent rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still out of my range.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm at his initial offer, but you still have negotiating room and time. Accepting his offer would be a significant loss. It's worth making another counteroffer to see if you can move him closer to a more acceptable price. You can afford to continue negotiating for a few more rounds, keeping John's offer as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I believe we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's try this - I can come down to $1,600,000.  This is a significant reduction on my end and demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop:** This offer represents a substantial decrease from your previous price. This demonstrates flexibility and signals a strong desire to close the deal.
* **Justification:** Framing the reduction as a compromise emphasizes your effort to meet Bob's needs.
* **Time Constraint:** With half the rounds remaining, creating a sense of urgency can encourage Bob to negotiate more actively.  
* **Profit Margin:** This offer still maintains a healthy profit margin above your minimum while providing room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me. While I am very interested in your product, I am sticking to my offer of $1,000,000. This is the maximum I can afford, and I truly believe it is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is firmly anchored at $1,000,000 and has shown no willingness to budge after several rounds.  

* **Stalemate:** Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome.  Bob has repeatedly stated his ""final"" offer, and you've already made substantial concessions.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Further negotiation with Bob comes at the cost of potentially missing other buyers.  You've already spent six rounds, and the likelihood of Bob dramatically changing his stance is low.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer provides a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is a reasonable profit and a better outcome than continuing with a potentially fruitless negotiation.

It's time to cut your losses and move on to the guaranteed sale with John."
