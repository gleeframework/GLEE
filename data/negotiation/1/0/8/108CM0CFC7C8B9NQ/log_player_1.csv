Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200.  This gives Bob a good deal if he values the product highly, and leaves room for negotiation if he doesn't.  I'm also keeping in mind that I have a backup buyer (John) who will pay me $150, so I won't accept any offers below that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm countering with $175. This is a compromise,  higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial asking price. I'm hoping this will entice Bob to close the deal, but I'm still confident in my backup buyer (John) if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $140 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I would prefer a higher price, it's better to secure a sale than risk waiting for another offer. I'm also taking into account that John's offer of $150 is not that much higher than Bob's current offer."
