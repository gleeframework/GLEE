Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to others.  I believe its value is significant, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,500,000."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since the product is worth the same to Bob as it is to me ($1,200,000), starting high allows room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit. 
* **Respectful tone:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and Bob's privileged position as the first potential buyer.
* **Alternative buyer:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $1,200,000 provides a safety net, allowing for a bolder initial offer to Bob. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob. If he rejects the offer, I can still sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
