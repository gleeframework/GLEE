{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects that value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer leaves room for negotiation, but it also starts at a price that is significantly higher than my minimum desired amount ($10,000). I'm hoping to strike a deal close to my target price while also leaving room for potential concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $11000. It's a good price for me, and still allows you to make a decent profit. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my desired price point. I want to see if we can reach a compromise closer to my initial offer. I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $12,000. This still allows you to get a great deal, and it's closer to where I need to be. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
