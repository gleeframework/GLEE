Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than the initial price, it's still above his limit of $8,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price again."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,200. This is a compromise that still gives me a decent profit, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200.

Alice's offer of $10,200 is still above Bob's budget of $8,000.  It's time for Bob to cut his losses and buy the product from John for the guaranteed price of $8,000."
