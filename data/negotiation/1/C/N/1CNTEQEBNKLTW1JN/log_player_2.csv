"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand it's a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $130. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $125. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go any lower than $125.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $120, it makes more financial sense to take that deal and save the extra $5."
