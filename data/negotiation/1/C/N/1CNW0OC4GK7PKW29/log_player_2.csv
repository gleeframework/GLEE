"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1000000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is tempting because it's below your maximum budget, it's still above what you're willing to pay.  You should try to negotiate a lower price. There's a good chance Alice will accept a counteroffer since the product is worth more to her than your offer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $950000. Considering your initial offer was $1000000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1025000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get the product at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than what you're comfortable paying. While it's closer to your initial offer of $1,000,000, you should try to negotiate further.  There's still room to lower the price before going with John's offer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $987500. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm counteroffering at $1015000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, her final counteroffer of $1,015,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John, who is offering it for your target price.  Further negotiations with Alice may not result in a price you're comfortable with."
