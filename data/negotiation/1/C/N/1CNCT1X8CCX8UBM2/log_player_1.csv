Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and potential. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you have leverage to aim significantly higher with Bob. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's ""value"" and ""potential"" to justify the high price, without explicitly revealing your bottom line.
* **Room for negotiation:** The tone is open for discussion, allowing Bob to counter-offer. This gives you the opportunity to potentially meet somewhere in the middle while still exceeding your minimum price. 

By starting high, you maximize your chances of securing a deal significantly more profitable than your guaranteed sale to John."
