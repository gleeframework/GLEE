"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $180 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $100. It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the product, $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $140 is a better offer than $180, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $100.  There's still room for negotiation, and it's worth seeing if Alice will budge further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still above my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $120.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a profit on this deal. I can do $130, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great price for a fantastic product, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $130 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $100.  While there is a chance Alice might lower her price further, it's a risk to continue negotiating.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $100 and secure the deal. This guarantees Bob gets the product within his budget."
