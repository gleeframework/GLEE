"Thank you for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the product, $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still above my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $120.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a profit on this deal. I can do $130, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great price for a fantastic product, and I think you'll really love it.",130.0,Alice,5,
