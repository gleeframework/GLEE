"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm excited to discuss the details with you. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the value it will bring to your business.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree your product is valuable, the price point of $800,000 is a bit high for me at the moment. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $500,000.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $500,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $700,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable compromise, considering the value it will bring to your business.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $700,000 is still a little steep for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $600,000? I think that's a fair offer.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'm proposing a price of $650,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value it will bring to your business.",650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I can tell you're firm on your price, but I have to stick to my budget.  How about $625,000?  That's the best I can do.",625000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $625,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'm proposing a price of $675,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value it will bring to your business.",675000.0,Alice,7,
