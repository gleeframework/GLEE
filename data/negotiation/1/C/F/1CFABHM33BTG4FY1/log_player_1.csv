Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm offering it to you for $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you start high to maximize potential profit.
* **Strategic positioning:** Offering the product slightly below your guaranteed price ($1,450,000) creates a sense of urgency and value. Bob gets a ""deal"" compared to your alternative, while you still earn significantly more than his perceived value. 
* **Limited-time element:** Emphasizing other interested parties increases pressure on Bob to decide quickly and favorably."
