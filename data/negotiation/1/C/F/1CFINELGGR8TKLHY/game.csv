"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $1000000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price.

Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1100000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1050000.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1050000 is still a bit above your comfort level, but I'm not willing to go below $1080000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $1500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
