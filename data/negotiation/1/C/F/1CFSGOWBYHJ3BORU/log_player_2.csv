"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's still below your estimated value and allows me to earn a significant profit. Let me know your decision.  If you decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $950,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. 
* You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $800,000.

Therefore, it makes the most financial sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John, saving you $150,000."
