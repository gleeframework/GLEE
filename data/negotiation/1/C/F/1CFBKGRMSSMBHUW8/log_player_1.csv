Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal for its value."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product is highly valued. 
* **Anchor Price:** By starting at $120, I'm anchoring the negotiation around a higher price point. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, his counteroffer might be closer to my desired range. 
* **Gauge Interest:** This initial offer will help me gauge Bob's interest level. If he outright rejects it, I know he might be very price-sensitive. If he counters, it shows he's seriously considering it. 
 
Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a decent offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's message indicates he's interested, and his counteroffer is a reasonable jump down from the initial price. I'll aim to meet him somewhere in the middle while still staying above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This approach often feels fair to both parties and can help move negotiations along quickly.
* **Staying above minimum:**  $105 is still a significant profit margin for me, and it leaves a little room for further negotiation if needed.  
* **Direct and clear:** I'm stating my counteroffer directly without playing games, showing Bob I'm serious about reaching a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:**  $95 is a solid profit over my minimum of $80. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob altogether. The potential gains from holding out for a few more dollars are outweighed by the risk of him walking away. 
* **Time Value:**  A deal in hand is worth more than the potential for a slightly better deal later. Closing the sale now allows me to move on to other opportunities."
