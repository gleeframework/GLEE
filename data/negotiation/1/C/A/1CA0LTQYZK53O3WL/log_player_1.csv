Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counter. This gives me room to negotiate while still aiming for a profit significantly above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price.  I'm not willing to accept that yet. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

I'm dropping the price a bit, but still aiming for a significant profit. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob, but still leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  While I would prefer a bit more, it's still a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
