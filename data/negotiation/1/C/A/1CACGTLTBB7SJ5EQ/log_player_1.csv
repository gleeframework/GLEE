Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  A higher price means more profit for me.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $10,000 gives me a safety net. If Bob rejects my offer, I can still sell to John and avoid a loss.
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  $12,000 is a starting point. I'm open to negotiation with Bob if he finds the price too high.

**Strategy:** 

By starting high, I encourage Bob to consider the value of the product. If he's truly interested, he might be willing to negotiate towards my desired price."
