"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  $110 seems a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $65 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for countering.  I'm glad we're getting closer. How about $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $75 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get closer to $90 with some further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $75 is still a bit low for me. How about $85? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting really close.  I could meet you halfway between our last offers at $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, accepting Bob's offer of $80 is the best option. This is because:

1. **Reaching a Deal:**  Accepting the offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation.
2. **Close to Minimum:**  $80 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $100.
3. **Limited Rounds:**  There are only a few rounds left, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better price.
4. **Jhon's Offer:** While Jhon offers $100, accepting Bob's offer is still a good outcome and allows me to secure a sale quickly."
