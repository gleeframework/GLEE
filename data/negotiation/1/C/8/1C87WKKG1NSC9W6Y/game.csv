"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. It's still a great deal for me, considering the product is worth $12,000 to you.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $13,000?  That's still a great price for you, and it gives us both room to be happy with the deal.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $12,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a deal at that price.",12500.0,Bob,4,
