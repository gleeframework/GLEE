Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate down if needed.  I'll see how Bob reacts to this initial offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway. $10,500 is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for me considering the value of the product.  Let's see if he'll bite!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product to him for $10,000.  While I could keep negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a better price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
