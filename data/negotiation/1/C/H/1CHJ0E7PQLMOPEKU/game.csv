"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $13,500? This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $13,500 is getting closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,750?",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle, but $12,750 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to go down to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for understanding. $13,000 is close, but I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. Would you consider $12,800?  That's the most I can offer.",12800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $12,800 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $12,900. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. I really want to make this deal work, but I can't go lower than this. Let me know what you think.",12900.0,Alice,7,
