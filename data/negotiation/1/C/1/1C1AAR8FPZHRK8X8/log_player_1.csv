Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than $8,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  He's willing to pay $15,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** Bob knows exactly what you're proposing.

This allows for a potential negotiation and maximizes your chances of getting a good price.  You can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response."
