Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $800,000 to Bob, so he won't pay more than that.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices at which both you and Bob would be willing to make a deal exist between $800,001 and $1,199,999. 

**Strategy**

You want to aim high within the ZOPA to maximize your profit. However, you need to give Bob a compelling enough reason to choose your offer over waiting for a potentially better deal elsewhere.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product before I make it available to others. Considering its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have significant interest from other parties."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity and Urgency:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""limited-time offer"" create a sense of scarcity and encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the ""unique value"" aims to shift Bob's focus from the pure monetary worth he initially sees.
* **High Anchor:** Starting at $1,100,000 sets a strong initial point within the ZOPA. While negotiable, it gives you room to come down if needed, while still securing a substantial profit above your guaranteed amount.

**Important Note:** Negotiation is dynamic. Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly while keeping your bottom line in mind."
