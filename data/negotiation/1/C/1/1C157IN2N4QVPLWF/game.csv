"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Could you do $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  However, I'm really trying to stay closer to $950,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $980,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is the best price I can offer, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",980000.0,Alice,5,
