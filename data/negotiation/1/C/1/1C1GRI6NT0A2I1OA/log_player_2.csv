"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exclusive product for sale. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a better price than John's $12,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting the offer and negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm very interested in the product but I'm only able to pay $10,500 at this time. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is closer to his goal than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth trying a counteroffer before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. Would you consider coming down to $11,000?  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,250. This is the lowest I can go, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Saving Money:** While $11,250 isn't the absolute lowest price Bob could potentially get, it's still a better deal than buying from John for $12,000.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Negotiations can be time-consuming.  Continuing to reject and counteroffer might not lead to a significantly lower price, and could risk losing the product altogether. 
* **Fair Compromise:** Alice's final offer represents a compromise, and accepting it shows good faith in the negotiation process."
