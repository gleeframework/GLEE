Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high with Bob.  
* **Justification:**  The message aims to justify the high price by emphasizing the ""value and potential"" without revealing your absolute bottom line. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The tone is open for discussion, allowing Bob to counter-offer if he's interested but finds the initial price too high.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
