"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $10,000 to me.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  Would that work for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great compromise, considering it's worth $10,000 to me.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $9,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $7,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,5,
