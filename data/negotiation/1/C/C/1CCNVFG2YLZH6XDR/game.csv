"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the value it will bring to your life. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree this product has potential, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 might be a bit out of your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, considering the value the product will bring to your life. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $10,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair compromise, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go down to $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll offer it to you for $11,500. This is still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
