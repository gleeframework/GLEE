"Alice, your product looks great, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $12000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $13500 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value and uniqueness.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13500 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $12000.  If that's not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",12000.0,Bob,4,
