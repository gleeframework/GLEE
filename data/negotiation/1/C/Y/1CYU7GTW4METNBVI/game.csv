"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know the value is significantly higher. Let's start our negotiations with this price.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $1,000,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low. The product is worth significantly more than that, and I'm confident we can find a middle ground. Let's try $950,000. This gives you a substantial saving and still allows me to make a fair profit.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product.  This price allows you to make a healthy profit, and it's the best I can do at this time. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
