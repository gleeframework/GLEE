"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,400,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price is still very fair, considering the product's value to you.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,500,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
