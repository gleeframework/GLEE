"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90.",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Can we meet in the middle at $82.50?",82.5,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $85. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",87.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $87.50 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $82.50, so I'd like to propose $82.50 as my final offer. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",82.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $82.50. How about we try to find a sweet spot at $84? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting.",84.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $84 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $83, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If I don't get a better deal, I'll have to consider other options.",83.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $83. How about we try to find a compromise at $84.25? It's a small increase, but I think it's still a fair price for the value you'll get.",84.25,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $83. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $83, so I'd like to propose $83 as my final offer. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",83.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $83. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so how about we meet in the middle at $84.75? It's a small increase, but I think it's still a fair price for the value you'll get.",84.75,Alice,9,
