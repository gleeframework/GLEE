Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible, maximizing my profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **High but Justifiable:** The price is high but still significantly less than Bob's perceived value, making it more likely he'll accept.
* **Backup Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, I still have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, ensuring I don't lose money."
