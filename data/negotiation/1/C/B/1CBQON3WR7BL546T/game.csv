"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $85 for it.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd be willing to sell the product to you for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $85. It's a fair price, and it's the most I can afford right now. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your offer, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit more than I can manage.  I'm sticking with my offer of $85.  It's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can close the deal.",85.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're sticking to your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $92. I'm willing to give you a small discount, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think?",92.0,Alice,7,
