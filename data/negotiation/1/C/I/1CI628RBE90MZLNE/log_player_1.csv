Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $18,000.  I believe in its value and think it would be of great use to you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely to secure a price closer to your ideal.
* **Justification:**  While not essential in this scenario (Bob has a set value), vaguely mentioning the product's value can sometimes sway buyers. 
* **Leaving Room for John:** If Bob rejects the offer, you're not losing out as you have John as a backup. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. You could choose to start lower or employ different negotiation tactics depending on your risk tolerance and how much you want to prioritize a deal with Bob."
