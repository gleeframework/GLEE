"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it! My initial price is $150.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $150 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $125? Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $125 is better than $100,  I'm still aiming for a higher price. I want to see if Bob is willing to come up a bit more before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $125 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference at $137.50? Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 137.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $137.50 is getting closer, but I'd like to meet in the middle. How about we go with $131.25?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $131.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $131.25
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value for me:** $131.25 is significantly higher than the $100 I'd get from John.
* **Potential for a better offer:** While I could try for a slightly higher price, there's a risk Bob will walk away. 
* **Time constraints:**  We're already in Round 4, and I want to avoid the risk of losing Bob and having to start over with John. 

This seems like a good compromise, and I'm confident I can get a better deal than selling to John."
