{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) to leave room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and hopeful for a quick deal.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter and potentially lower the price a bit if necessary, but I'll always keep John's offer of $12,000 in mind as my floor price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. Let's see if we can find some middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to sell below my minimum price of $12,000 just yet. I'll counter with a price closer to his offer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

I'm offering a price in the middle ground between my desired price and Bob's offer, hoping to find a compromise.  If Bob rejects, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John, as my margin for negotiation is getting smaller."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $12,500 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,250. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum price, and I'm confident I won't get a better deal. I'll accept his offer to secure the sale and avoid the risk of him backing out completely."
