Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can then assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation or selling to John for my guaranteed minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'd like to sell, I'm not willing to go below my minimum value of $1,500,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm offering $1,600,000. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still above my minimum value but shows I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum value. There's no need to risk further negotiation. Accepting his offer guarantees me the minimum I'm willing to accept, and avoids the risk of Bob rejecting my counteroffer again."
