"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good profit. Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm leaving room for negotiation but still pushing for a price that reflects the product's value to me. I'll monitor Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a decent price, I'm still confident I can get closer to my ideal price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still above Bob's counteroffer. I'm trying to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us. I believe this price is still fair, considering the value of the product to me. I'm confident that we can reach an agreement within the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price,  Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is getting close enough to my target.  I'm confident that further negotiation might yield a better outcome, but with only 6 rounds remaining, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  Accepting Bob's offer secures a good profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
