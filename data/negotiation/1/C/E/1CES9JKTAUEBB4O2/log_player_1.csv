Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $13,500. I believe it will be very valuable for you, but I'm open to discussing the price further."", ""product_price"": 13500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not too high):** I'm starting significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) and my minimum ($10,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.  A price too close to $10,000 might make him lose interest quickly. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message explicitly states I'm ""open to discussing the price,"" signaling I'm willing to negotiate.  
* **Alternative Option:**  It's important to remember I have John as a backup buyer at $10,000.  I won't go below this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. Would you be able to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. His counteroffer suggests he's quite interested in the product. I'll try to push for a slightly higher price before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you countering, Bob. While I value your interest, $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (but with a bias):**  I'm signaling a willingness to negotiate by moving closer to his price. However, I'm not splitting the difference equally. This keeps the price above my minimum while still offering a potentially attractive deal for Bob.
* **Clear and Direct:** The message is clear about my desired price and avoids any ambiguity. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm still holding onto a price higher than my fallback option (John at $10,000)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I still feel that $10,000 would be a fair compromise. Could we meet at $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly anchored at $10,000. While I'd like to get more, his latest offer of $10,500 is a reasonable compromise. It's $500 more than my minimum and continuing the negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better result.  It's better to take the profit now than risk losing the sale."
