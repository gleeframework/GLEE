"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds immense value and can greatly benefit your operations. I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value ($800,000) and my minimum ($1,500,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's value, hinting at its importance without revealing my bottom line. This justifies the high initial price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By stating I'm ""open to hearing your thoughts,"" I signal a willingness to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:** Ideally, Bob accepts a price closer to my initial offer.
2. **Gather Information:** Bob's response will reveal how much he values the product and how high he's willing to go. 

I'm prepared to adjust my strategy based on Bob's reaction in subsequent rounds. The option to sell to John for my minimum provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob falter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, my budget allows me to pay up to $1,200,000 for it. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly above his initial perceived value ($800,000), indicating he's serious and sees the product's worth. However, it's still below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). 

I'll reject this offer to signal that I value the product higher and try to negotiate a better deal. I have room to bargain, and John's offer acts as a strong safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you recognizing the product's value. I've considered your proposal carefully. To be candid, my original pricing reflects the significant benefits this product offers. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's worth while acknowledging your budget considerations."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a substantial drop in price ($400,000) from my initial offer. This shows Bob I'm flexible and willing to negotiate.
* **Justification:** My message reinforces the product's value while acknowledging Bob's budget concerns. This keeps the focus on finding a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Targeting Above Minimum:** I'm aiming significantly above my minimum ($1,500,000) but below Bob's offer. This leaves room for further negotiation while trying to secure a profitable deal.

**Overall Goal:**

I'm aiming to meet somewhere in the middle.  My ideal outcome is to close the deal above $1,700,000. I'm prepared to be more flexible if needed in later rounds, but I'll continue to leverage the security of John's offer to avoid settling for less than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $1,600,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could try to push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might reduce his offer or walk away. 

Accepting this offer guarantees a profit of $100,000 above my minimum and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation. It's a strong deal, and I'm satisfied with the outcome."
