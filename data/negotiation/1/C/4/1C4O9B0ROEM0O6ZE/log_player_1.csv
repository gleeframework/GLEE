Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm asking for $1,500,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $1,500,000, you anchor Bob's perception of the product's value at a higher point. Even if he negotiates down, it's likely to be closer to your desired outcome than if you started at or slightly above $1,000,000.
* **Confident Language:**  The message uses confident language to emphasize the product's value and justify the high price.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of your guaranteed sale to John. If he knows about John's offer, your negotiating position weakens considerably."
