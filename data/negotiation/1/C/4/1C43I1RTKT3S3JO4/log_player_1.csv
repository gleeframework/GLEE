Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a good compromise:** It's higher than your minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but lower than Bob's perceived value of $10,000. This makes it likely that Bob will consider it.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you have room to counter with a higher price. If he accepts, you've secured a good deal.
* **It sets a high starting point:** By starting at $9500, you can potentially get closer to your desired outcome of $10,000 if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum price of $8,000, it's still significantly lower than your desired outcome and what you know the product is worth to him.  By rejecting his offer, you can attempt to get a better price in the next round of negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise that's:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:** It shows you're willing to negotiate but also demonstrates the product's value.
* **Still within a reasonable range:**  It's closer to Bob's offer, increasing the chances of acceptance.
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:**  You still have space to move up if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,600 is a good compromise. It's:

* **Above your minimum price:** You're guaranteed to make a profit.
* **Getting closer to your desired outcome:**  It's higher than what you could get from John.
* **A reasonable negotiation outcome:**  There's no guarantee you'll get closer to $10,000.

While you could try for a higher price, there's a risk that further negotiations will break down, forcing you to sell to John for a lower price. Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids potential losses."
