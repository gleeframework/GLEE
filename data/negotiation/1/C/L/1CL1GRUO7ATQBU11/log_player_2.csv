# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a steal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.

You should reject Alice's offer. While $120 is less than what Alice values the product for, you know you can get it for $100 from John."
