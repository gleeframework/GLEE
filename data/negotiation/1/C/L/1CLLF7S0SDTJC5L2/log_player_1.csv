Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is simply too high for me. Given my budget constraints and the product's worth to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000. This offer reflects a significant discount while still allowing you a healthy profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground.
