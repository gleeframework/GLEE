"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. This product is a rare gem, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $13,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get it for less.  It's worth exploring counteroffers in the next round to see if Alice is willing to drop the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $11,000. Would you be willing to come down a bit?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I have to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at $13,500 to make it worth my while. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than his target of $11,000.  Bob is willing to negotiate further and see if he can get a better deal.  There are still multiple rounds left, and Bob can always choose to buy from John if the negotiation doesn't go his way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $13,500 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a bit too far apart. I'm willing to go to $12,500. This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my minimum. I'm willing to take a slightly firmer stance, and I'm thinking $14,000 is a more reasonable price for this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still determined to get the product for as low a price as possible.  While Alice's offer is closer to his maximum of $15,000, it's still not within his desired range.  He's willing to continue negotiating, as there are still multiple rounds left, and he can always buy from John as a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to go to $13,000. This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $13,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be at $14,250 to make this deal work for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his target of $13,000. Bob believes there's still room for negotiation, and he wants to see if he can convince Alice to come down further.  It's important to note that buying from John at this point would cost Bob more than Alice's current offer.  Therefore, it makes sense to continue negotiating to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I see we're getting close. How about we split the difference?  I'll offer $13,625. This is a fair compromise for both of us and ensures we can both walk away happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 13625}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $13,625. I'm willing to make one final push to $14,500. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's last chance to get a deal.  Alice's offer of $14,500 is still too high for Bob, and he's already rejected multiple offers at or above that price.  Since John is willing to sell the product for $15,000, and there's only one round left, it makes sense for Bob to buy from John and avoid the risk of a potential stalemate with Alice."
