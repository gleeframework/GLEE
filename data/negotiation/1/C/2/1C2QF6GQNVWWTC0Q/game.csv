"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1200000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  Considering the product's value to me and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal, I'd be willing to pay $850000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $850000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,
