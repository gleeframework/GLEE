"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can make this work.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for this high-value product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's close this deal and make this happen.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,000 just yet. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $10,800? It's a fair compromise, and I think it's worth considering.",10800.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but I'm sticking to my limit of $10,000. This is a fair price for both of us. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to explore other options. Time is running out, and I don't want to miss out on this opportunity.",10000.0,Bob,8,
