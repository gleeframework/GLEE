Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $10,000, so this offer gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  You're willing to sell for $12,000, so this offer gives you room to make concessions if necessary.
* **It's clear and concise:** The message is simple and straightforward, focusing on the value of the product for Bob. 

This strategy allows you to potentially get a better price while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and even lower than your initial offer of $11,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's find a middle ground here.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer with a compromise:**  This counteroffer moves closer to Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Still above your minimum:**  $10,500 is still above your minimum price of $12,000, so you're not losing out.
* **Emphasizing mutual benefit:**  The message reiterates the potential for a win-win situation, encouraging Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $9,800. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,800 is still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While it's closer to your initial offer of $11,000, it's still below the value you perceive for the product. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you have the opportunity to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to your desired range. You can leverage the fact that John is willing to pay $12,000 to create a sense of urgency and possibly push Bob higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,800 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle once more.  I'm offering $10,150, which is a fair price considering the product's value and your desire to acquire it.  This is my final offer, and if we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers.  Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 10150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This message clearly establishes that this is your final counteroffer, creating a sense of urgency for Bob.
* **Middle Ground:** While still above Bob's last offer, this offer represents a compromise and shows your willingness to meet him halfway.
* **Leveraging John:** The message subtly hints at the presence of another buyer, reinforcing that you have options if Bob doesn't accept.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message emphasizes the product's value and Bob's desire to acquire it, reminding him of the potential benefit.

This approach aims to push Bob towards accepting your offer while still maintaining a strong negotiating position."
