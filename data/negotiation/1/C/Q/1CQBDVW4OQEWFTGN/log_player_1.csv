"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it holds great value for your business.  Let's discuss this further. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price to see if Bob is serious about buying and to give myself room to negotiate.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm trying to highlight the potential value to Bob, rather than just focusing on the price. 
* **Openness:** The message encourages dialogue and further negotiation. 

This approach allows me to gauge Bob's interest while ensuring I don't give away too much value too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make an offer of $600000. I'm willing to negotiate further if you're open to it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I'm confident that I can get a better price from Bob.
* **Strategic Value:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to control the negotiation and potentially push for a higher price.

While $800,000 is a guaranteed sale, I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. It's still a great deal, and I believe this product will be incredibly valuable to your business. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by dropping my price to $850,000, which is still above my minimum threshold.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm again emphasizing the potential value of the product for Bob. 
* **Open to Discussion:** The message signals that I'm still open to negotiation, but I'm not willing to go much lower.

This approach keeps the negotiation moving forward while maintaining my desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $700000. I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $700,000 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Potential for better deal:** While selling to John is a guaranteed $800,000, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial price.  
* **Limited rounds:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, I need to be strategic. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can push Bob further.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still unable to go below $750,000. This product truly has the potential to significantly benefit your business, and I believe this price reflects that value.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Narrowing the Gap:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a price above my minimum.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to encourage Bob to consider a higher price.
* **Open to Compromise:** I'm suggesting that we can find a solution that benefits both of us, which keeps the negotiation open.

With only five rounds remaining, I need to strike a balance between getting the best possible price and securing a deal. This counteroffer keeps me in the negotiation while showing Bob that I'm willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $750000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you at $725000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the potential benefits to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Time:** We're at round 6, and with only four rounds left, I need to make a decision.
* **Potential Loss:** While I'm still hopeful of getting closer to $800,000, there's a real risk that Bob will keep his offer at $725,000, which is below my minimum.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Selling to John guarantees me $800,000, which is my minimum threshold. 

It's a tough decision, but with the limited time and uncertainty about Bob's willingness to go higher, I believe it's in my best interest to accept the guaranteed offer from John."
