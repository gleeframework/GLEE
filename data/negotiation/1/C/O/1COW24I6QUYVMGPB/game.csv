"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a fair price considering its unique features and the value it can bring to your business.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. This reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. This is a fair compromise considering the value it can bring to your business.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $825000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still going to need a bit more flexibility.  How about $800000? That's my final offer, as I can get the same product from John for that price.",800000.0,Bob,4,
