"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product,  $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below what I consider its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about we settle on $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I could go up to $900,000.  I think that's a fair offer considering it's closer to your original asking price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
