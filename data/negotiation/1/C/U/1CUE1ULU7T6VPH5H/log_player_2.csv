Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make you an initial offer of $1,100,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to maximize the value of this transaction.

It's time to cut our losses.  Alice is unlikely to go below $800,000, and we have a guaranteed option with John at that price."
