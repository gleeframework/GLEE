"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  I understand it's a bit high for you, but I'm still firm on needing to get closer to $10,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?  This gives you a good deal, and me a fair price for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9750.0,Alice,3,
