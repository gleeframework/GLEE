Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find valuable, for $95. It's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $95 gives Bob a small incentive to buy (saving $5) while allowing you to maximize your profit. If Bob rejects the offer, you can still sell it to John for your minimum acceptable price."
