```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $15,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground here! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $15,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and try $13,500. This is a fair price that is within my budget.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about $14,250? This is a fair price that is closer to my minimum and still a good value for you. I'm sure we can agree on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, $14,250 is still above his budget. He can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy the product from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to stay within my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $13,750. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your effort, but $13,750 is still a bit too low. How about we split the difference again and try $14,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's settle this now, okay? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. While Alice has lowered her price to $14,000, Bob is running out of rounds and is getting closer to his limit. It's likely that he will not be able to get Alice down to his desired price point. Buying from John guarantees he gets the product for his maximum budget, and ensures he avoids risking further negotiation."
