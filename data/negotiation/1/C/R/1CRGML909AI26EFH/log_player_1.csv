{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's interests:**  I'm framing the offer as a mutually beneficial deal, highlighting its potential value to his business.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm prepared to negotiate, but starting high allows me to maximize my potential profit.
* **Protecting my minimum value:** If Bob rejects this offer, I can always sell to John for my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,400,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $900,000.  This is my best offer, let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, he has shown interest in the product and is willing to negotiate.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price by counteroffering.
* **John is a safety net:** If further negotiation fails, I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, ensuring I don't lose money."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price constraints. While $900,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference at $1,150,000? This still allows for a significant profit for me and would be a great investment for your company.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's limitations while still aiming for a price closer to my target.
* **Splitting the difference:** A midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob that this is a valuable asset that will benefit his business. 
* **Framing it as a solution:** I'm presenting this as a way to find common ground and move the negotiation forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This would be a good deal for both of us and a strong investment for my company. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  Bob is demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, suggesting there might be room for a higher offer.
* **John's offer is my safety net:** I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, ensuring I don't lose money if negotiations with Bob fail. 

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my target, aiming to get a higher price while still remaining open to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This price still represents a solid investment for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle (again):** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's latest counteroffer, showing a willingness to compromise and find a middle ground.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm reminding Bob that this product is valuable and will provide him with a strong return on his investment.
* **Framing it as a win-win:** I'm positioning my offer as a solution that benefits both parties, creating a sense of mutual benefit.
* **Staying above my minimum:**  While I'm compromising, I'm staying above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, ensuring I don't lose money in the deal.

This counteroffer aims to further bridge the gap between our positions and hopefully secure a deal that is favorable for both of us."
