Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,400,000 is still above Bob's budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price constraints. While $900,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference at $1,150,000? This still allows for a significant profit for me and would be a great investment for your company.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a step in the right direction, $1,150,000 is still above Bob's budget. There's still room to negotiate further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This price still represents a solid investment for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice is unwilling to budge significantly, and Bob's budget is $800,000. At this point, it's in Bob's best interest to secure the product from John and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
