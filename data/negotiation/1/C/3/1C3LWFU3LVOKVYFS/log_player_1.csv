{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, as I know it would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $12,000, which reflects its significant worth."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $8,000 from John, making this your absolute floor.
* **Splitting the Difference:**  Offering the product for $12,000 splits the difference between your minimum and Bob's valuation, creating a potentially appealing deal for both parties. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** This offer assumes Bob isn't aware of your guaranteed sale to John. If he knows your minimum, he might negotiate harder.
* **Negotiation:** This offer is a starting point. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer and adjust your strategy accordingly."
