,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go down to $80 just yet. How about we meet in the middle at $85? It's still a great price for this amazing product.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $85 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Can you meet me at that price?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $75 just yet. How about we compromise at $82? It's a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value.",82.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant at $82. Can you meet me at $78? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.,78.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go down to $78, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that. How about we meet in the middle at $81? It's a fair price considering the value I'm offering.",81.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit tired of negotiating, but I'm willing to make one last offer. I'll give you $79. That's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $150.",79.0,Bob,8,
