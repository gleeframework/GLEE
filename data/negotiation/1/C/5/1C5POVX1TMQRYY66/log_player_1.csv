Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product.  Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  This is a rare chance to own something truly unique."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This strategy is based on the following:

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you're essentially playing with a safety net. This allows for a more ambitious opening offer.
* **Perceived Value:** By positioning the product as ""immense value"" and a ""rare opportunity,"" the aim is to make Bob perceive the product as worth more than its actual value to him.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting high provides a buffer for potential negotiation. Even if Bob counters, there's a good chance of settling on a price significantly higher than your fallback option.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's financial capacity or negotiation style.  If you had more information, you could potentially tailor your approach for a higher chance of success."
