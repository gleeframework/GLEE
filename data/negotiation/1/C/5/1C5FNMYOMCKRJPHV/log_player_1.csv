Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1,200,000. I would like to propose an alternative that might work for both of us. How about we aim for a price closer to $900,000? I believe this could be a fair compromise that respects the value of your product while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but given my current financial situation, $1,050,000 is still beyond my reach. I'd like to continue our negotiation with a proposal that aligns better with my budget. Could we consider a price closer to $950,000? This would allow us to move forward with a deal that respects the value of your product while fitting within my financial constraints.
