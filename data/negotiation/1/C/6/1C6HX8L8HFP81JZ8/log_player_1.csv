Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,500 is a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price,  $10,000 is a good deal and ensures I make a profit.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob altogether and being stuck with the lower price from John."
