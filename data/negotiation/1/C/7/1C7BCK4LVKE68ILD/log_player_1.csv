Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $140.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $140, which is a good starting point, considering the product is worth $150 to Bob. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, reminding him of its worth. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message implies I'm open to negotiation, but I'm starting with a price that's closer to my ideal outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $140 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $130 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $130 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I believe I can still negotiate a higher price. By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm willing to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. $130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I'm making a counter offer that's closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on Compromise:** I'm emphasizing the idea of meeting in the middle, suggesting a fair deal for both of us. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation amicable."
