Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, playing the role of Alice:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I have strong interest from other parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $1,200,000. Offering it slightly below that at $1,150,000 gives Bob a good deal while still netting Alice a significant profit above her minimum.
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning ""other parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" adds a touch of pressure for Bob to act quickly and not risk losing the deal.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is strong, there's a slight margin for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to negotiate, keeping the conversation open.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your desired negotiation style and your assessment of Bob's personality, other offers might be more suitable."
