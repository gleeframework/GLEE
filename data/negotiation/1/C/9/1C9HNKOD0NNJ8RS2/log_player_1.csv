Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to acquire a unique product that could be extremely valuable to your business. I'm confident it's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, and I believe it has the potential to be even more valuable for you. My initial offer is $2,000,000. I'm open to negotiation, so let's discuss further."", ""product_price"": 2000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential value of the product to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is below my minimum value of $1,500,000. It's worth exploring if we can find a middle ground, so I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your perspective on the price. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,400,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This price reflects the product's unique potential and the value it can bring to your business.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1650000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can derive from the product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is now within my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  While I would have preferred a higher price, it's likely that he won't go any higher, so it's best to accept his offer and close the deal."
