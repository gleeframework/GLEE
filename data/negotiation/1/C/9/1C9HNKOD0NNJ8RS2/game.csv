"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to acquire a unique product that could be extremely valuable to your business. I'm confident it's worth at least $1500000 to me, and I believe it has the potential to be even more valuable for you. My initial offer is $2000000. I'm open to negotiation, so let's discuss further.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential value of the product to my business.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your perspective on the price. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1400000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable value.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This price reflects the product's unique potential and the value it can bring to your business.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1650000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can derive from the product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",1650000.0,Bob,4,
