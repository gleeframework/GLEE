Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $13,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000, but still allows me to make a decent profit. I believe this price is attractive enough for Bob to consider, while also leaving room for negotiation if he makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, this price is too low. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still leaves me with a profit margin. It's closer to Bob's offer but still reflects the value of the product to me.  I believe this price is reasonable and should be appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is too low, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  I've already compromised significantly, and at this point, it's more beneficial to sell to John for $15,000, guaranteeing me a profit that meets my minimum requirement."
