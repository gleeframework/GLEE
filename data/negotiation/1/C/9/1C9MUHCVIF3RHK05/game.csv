"Thanks for the offer Alice.  I'm interested in the product but $9,500 is a bit high for me.  How about we start at $8,500?  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  It's still a good deal for you, and it gives us both a fair price.  Let's make a deal!",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $8,750?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,750 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,875.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it brings us closer to a deal.  Let's make this happen!",8875.0,Alice,5,
