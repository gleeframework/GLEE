"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a very valuable product that I believe would be of great interest to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. This price reflects the significant value it holds and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,150,000 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it, and it allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can come to terms."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000. This still allows for a good margin for both of us, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is still lower than John's price of $1,200,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer again. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a lower price than John's and saves time and potential further negotiations."
