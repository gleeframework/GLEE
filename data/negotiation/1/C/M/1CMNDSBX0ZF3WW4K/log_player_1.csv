Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate but is still within a range you're comfortable with.
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  This provides you with a margin to work with in case Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** It shows you're willing to negotiate but also have a firm idea of the product's worth. 

Remember, you can always adjust this price based on Bob's response and the progress of the negotiation.  If he rejects, you can consider a lower counteroffer. But if he accepts, you've secured a good price!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still below your ideal price.  You have a strong alternative with John who is willing to pay your minimum.  By rejecting Bob's offer, you can try to negotiate a higher price.  

**Next Steps:**

You should send a counteroffer to Bob.  Consider offering a price slightly lower than your initial offer, but higher than Bob's offer. For example:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,125,000. This gives us both a good deal. Let's finalize this."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

This approach shows you're willing to compromise but still aim for a price closer to your desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit higher than your offer, but I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This price is still fair considering the value of the product to you. I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

This counteroffer offers a middle ground between your previous offer and Bob's offer. It shows you're willing to compromise but also emphasizes the value of the product for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, it's still below your ideal price, and you're already at a point where further negotiation might not yield a significantly better outcome.  John is offering your minimum price and a guaranteed sale, which is the most lucrative option at this point. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing the negotiation with Bob might take more time and effort, and there's no guarantee of a better price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential reward of a slightly higher price from Bob is not worth the risk of losing out on John's guaranteed offer. 
* **John's Value:** John is offering your minimum price, which is already a good deal for you.

**Conclusion:**

Selling to John is the most strategic choice, as it secures your minimum desired price and avoids further negotiation that might not be fruitful."
