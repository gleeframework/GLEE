"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,500,000. It's a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested, or we can discuss a different price point.  I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset to your company. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You're looking to save money.  Alice's offer is exactly your maximum, meaning you won't save anything.  John is offering the product at the same price, so you have no incentive to accept Alice's offer. You can reject and buy from John."
