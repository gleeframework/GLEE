Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe it's a fantastic deal and would provide significant value to you."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but we also want to make the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** We know Bob values the product at $12,000. Offering it at $14,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being a significant profit for you. 
* **Alternative Buyer (John):** Having John as a backup buyer at $15,000 gives us leverage. If Bob rejects the offer, we don't lose anything.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Skills:** If you think Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start with a slightly lower price (e.g., $13,500). 
* **Time Sensitivity:** If you need to sell the product quickly, a slightly lower price might be more appealing to ensure a quick sale."
