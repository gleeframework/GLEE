"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,600,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $800,000, which is the maximum I'm able to pay. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a very competitive offer considering the potential returns you'll see.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me. I'm firm at $800,000. This is my final offer.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your stance, but I need to see a bit more movement on price for this to make sense for me. How about $1,200,000? This offer reflects the significant value this product holds.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still committed to purchasing this product, but $1,200,000 is simply out of my range.  I'm sticking to my offer of $800,000. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll unfortunately have to move on.",800000.0,Bob,6,
