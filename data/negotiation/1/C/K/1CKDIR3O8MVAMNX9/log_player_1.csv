"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's valuation, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident that I can get a good price, but I'm also willing to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget of $100. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum price of $150. While I'm hoping to close a deal with Bob, I'm not willing to sell for such a low price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $135?  That's a fair price, and it still leaves me some room to make a profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

I'm lowering my price, but only slightly. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a little more. I'm confident that I can get a better price than $100, but I'm still open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $120 as the price for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'll counteroffer once more to see if we can reach a deal before moving on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $120.  However, I'm still a bit short of where I need to be.  I'm willing to go down to $130, but that's my final offer.  It's a great deal on a great product, and I think it's fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

I'm lowering my price again, but only by a small amount. I'm hoping that Bob will see that I'm serious about selling the product to him, and that he'll be willing to meet me in the middle.  If he doesn't, I'm prepared to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've been considering my options carefully. I would like to propose $125 as the final price for the product. I hope this meets your needs and allows us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is just above my minimum price of $150, and I'm running out of time.  I'm confident that I can get a better price if I keep negotiating, but it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers. Selling to John is always an option, but I'd prefer to close a deal with Bob. I'll accept his offer and move on."
