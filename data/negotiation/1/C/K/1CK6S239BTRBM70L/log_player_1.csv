Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high price, aiming for a good profit.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm starting high and seeing if he's willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiations or sell to John."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'll proceed to the next round and counteroffer with a price closer to my valuation."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering with $900,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, hoping to find a middle ground and encourage further negotiation."
