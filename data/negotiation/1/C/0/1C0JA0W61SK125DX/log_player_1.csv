{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. It acknowledges Bob's higher value for the product while still allowing for a significant profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than that. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $950000. I'm willing to pay $920000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is very close to my minimum and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. It's better to accept his offer and secure the sale."
