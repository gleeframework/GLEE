Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher offer than your minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" and offering a pre-public sale, I'm adding perceived value to the product in Bob's mind.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** The tone is friendly and open to discussion, encouraging Bob to counter-offer if he finds the price too high.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of John's offer. If Bob knows about John, he'll likely counter much lower, closer to the $12,000 mark. 
* I'm aiming high, but it's crucial to be realistic. An excessively high offer might deter Bob completely."
