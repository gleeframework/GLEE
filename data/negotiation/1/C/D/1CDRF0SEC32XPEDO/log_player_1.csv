"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,750,000, which is above Bob's estimated value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I highlight the ""great deal"" for both of us to encourage cooperation.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm inviting Bob to respond, setting the stage for potential counteroffers. 

**Strategy:** 

I aim to start high and gradually reduce the price if needed, while keeping in mind my minimum value of $1,500,000. If Bob rejects my offer, I will analyze his counteroffer and make a decision based on the remaining rounds. I'm also aware of John's offer, which I can use as a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a lower price. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $1,400,000 is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** I have 8 rounds remaining, and there's still room for negotiation to reach a price that benefits me.
* **Potential for a better offer:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a higher price and potentially close the deal closer to my desired value.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize profit. While selling to John for $1,500,000 is a safe option, I'm still optimistic about reaching a deal with Bob. By rejecting his offer, I signal my willingness to negotiate further and can potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $1,400,000 is tempting, I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000?  This would still be a great value for you, and it's a price I can realistically accept. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer with justification:** I'm not accepting Bob's offer but am offering a counter-proposal with a clear reason for it - meeting in the middle.
* **Focus on value:** I emphasize that $1,600,000 still offers Bob a ""great value"", making it more appealing.
* **Optimistic tone:**  My message maintains a positive and cooperative tone to keep the negotiations amicable.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to secure a price closer to my desired value without losing Bob entirely. By meeting him ""in the middle,"" I'm demonstrating flexibility and creating an opportunity for a potential agreement within the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer, so I'll counteroffer $1,200,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,200,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Time is still on my side:**  I have 6 rounds remaining, and I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer shows him that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price.

**Strategy:**

I believe there's still potential for a higher offer from Bob. By rejecting his offer, I'm maintaining my leverage and keeping the negotiations open. I can counter with a price closer to my desired value in the next round. While selling to John is a safe option, I'm committed to seeing if I can get a better price from Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately still too low for me.  To move forward, I need to be closer to my minimum price of $1,500,000. Would you be willing to consider $1,450,000? This is a significant compromise from my initial position, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but fair:** I reiterate my minimum price to demonstrate my commitment while proposing a compromise.
* **Focus on value and compromise:** I highlight my compromise and the fair value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Positive and solution-oriented:**  I end with a call to action for a mutually beneficial solution.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain my ground:**  I'm not willing to go lower than $1,450,000, but I'm still open to negotiation. 
* **Increase the pressure:** This is a significant counteroffer, making it clear that time is running out for Bob to make a deal at a lower price. 
* **Signal flexibility:** While I'm firm on my price, I remain open to finding a solution that works for both of us."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Explanation:**

* **Potential for a better offer:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a higher price and potentially close the deal closer to my desired value.

**Strategy:**

While selling to John for $1,500,000 is a safe option, I'm still optimistic about reaching a deal with Bob.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my desired value in the next round.  I believe I can get a better offer from Bob, especially with the pressure of limited time remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,300,000 is still below my minimum.  We're getting close, but I need to be at least $1,400,000 to make this work for me. I've already lowered my price considerably, and I'm confident this product is worth that value to you.  If we can't find common ground at $1,400,000, I may have to consider other offers. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but conciliatory:** I'm not budging on my minimum price but acknowledge Bob's efforts to find a compromise.
* **Emphasize value:** I remind Bob that the product is worth $1,400,000 to him.
* **Create urgency:** I mention considering ""other offers"" to imply that time is running out.

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize leverage:** I'm making a final stand at $1,400,000, hoping Bob will concede to avoid losing the deal.
* **Balancing act:** I'm being firm but not overly aggressive to keep the door open for a deal.
* **Preparing for the next move:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to decide whether to counter again or go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to reach a compromise, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, $1,250,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the negotiations we've had so far. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is running out:** With only two rounds left, the window for a better deal with Bob is closing.
* **Bob's offer is unacceptable:** $1,250,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **John's offer is secure:**  John's offer guarantees me my minimum value, providing financial stability.

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to sell to John. Although I would like to get closer to my initial asking price, the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob is too high.  John's offer ensures I get my minimum value and avoids the possibility of ending up with a much lower price.  It's important to be realistic about the market and secure a deal that meets my financial needs."
