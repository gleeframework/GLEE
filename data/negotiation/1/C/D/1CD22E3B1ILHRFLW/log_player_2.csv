"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a decent starting point, it's still above my ideal price range. It's worth exploring if I can negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

My goal is to save as much money as possible, and I know Alice values the product at $800,000.  Offering $850,000 is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for potential negotiation but still representing a significant saving for me compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her offer slightly, but it's still above my preferred price. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can secure a better deal.  It's worth exploring if I can push for a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing some flexibility by increasing her offer, but it's still not quite where I want it to be. I'm going to increase my counteroffer slightly to $900,000, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate but also signaling that I'm not willing to pay a significantly higher price than my initial offer. This should keep the negotiation moving forward while still aiming for a price closer to my goal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is only slightly lower than her previous offer and still above my preferred price range. While I'm getting closer, I'm not willing to settle for a price that's too high.  I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll counteroffer again to push for a price closer to my ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm gradually increasing my counteroffers, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate but also showing that I'm not willing to pay an exorbitant price.  $925,000 represents a reasonable compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This should keep the negotiations moving forward while still allowing me to potentially save more money than buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $955,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $955,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a bit lower than her previous offer, but it's still above my preferred price range. I'm getting closer to my target, but I'm not ready to accept just yet. I'll counteroffer again to try and get a lower price before it's too late."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 940000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has been steadily lowering her price, showing a willingness to compromise.  I'm going to make a final counteroffer at $940,000. This is a significant improvement over Alice's previous offer and brings us closer to a deal.  I'm hopeful that Alice will accept this offer, as it's a fair price for both of us. If she doesn't, I'm still considering buying from John, but I'm optimistic that I can secure a deal with Alice at this price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are running out of rounds. Alice's latest offer is still above my preferred price range. While I could continue to negotiate, it's risky to keep rejecting offers with only one round left. If I reject this offer, Alice might make a counteroffer that is even higher. Therefore, it's safer to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, even though it's slightly higher than my ideal price, to ensure I get the product."
