"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1050000 again, but this time it's not a compromise, it's a non-negotiable price. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
