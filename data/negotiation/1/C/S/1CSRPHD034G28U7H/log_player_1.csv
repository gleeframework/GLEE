"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers. It's also above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, which is important to remember as I have the option to sell to John at that price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $18,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}
``` 

I'm offering $19,000.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I want to show flexibility but still aim for a price closer to my ideal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. We're getting closer to a deal, but I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18750}
```

I'm offering $18,750.  This is a further compromise, but I still believe I can get a bit more. With only 5 rounds left, I need to find a balance between getting a good price and closing the deal before I have to settle for John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. We've been going back and forth for a few rounds, and while I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, $18,600 is a fair price and I don't want to risk losing the deal to John."
