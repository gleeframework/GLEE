"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product.  It's worth a lot to me, and I believe it would be a great asset for you as well. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000.  This is a significant discount from its true value, and I'm confident it's a price that will work for both of us. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I am still looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would you be willing to consider selling the product for $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, and I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,375,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to benefit from the deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
