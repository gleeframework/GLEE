"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, and I believe it's also a great value for the price. Let's make this transaction happen. I propose we set the price at $110 for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get a better price by negotiating. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down to $110.  However, I'm looking to spend closer to $105.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway there?"", ""product_price"": 107.5} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and I'd like to try to accommodate you. I propose we set the price at $108.50 for the product. This is a bit higher than your offer but still below the original asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $105.  Alice's offer is only slightly lower than her initial offer, and it's still above Bob's target. Rejecting and counter-offering again gives Bob another chance to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to work with me. Let's split the difference again and settle on $106.50. This is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 106.5} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your proposal, Bob. I've considered your suggestion and I think we can reach an agreement. I would like to offer the product to you for $107. This is a bit above your offer but still below my initial asking price. I hope this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $107 is within Bob's budget and only $2 higher than his target price of $105. Accepting the offer saves time and effort compared to continuing the negotiation. While Bob might be able to negotiate a slightly lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting the counteroffer and potentially reaching a higher price with John makes it advantageous to accept this offer."
