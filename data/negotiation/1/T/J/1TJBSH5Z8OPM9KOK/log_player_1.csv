Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $2,000,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can aim higher with Bob. Starting at $2,000,000 allows room for negotiation while ensuring you don't settle for less than your minimum.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price without revealing your absolute bottom line.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains collaborative (""What are your thoughts?"")  signaling that you're open to discussing the price further.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit with Bob while having the safety net of John's offer if negotiations fail."
