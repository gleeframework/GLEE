Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his valuation, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He knows he can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which gives him leverage to push Alice further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,025,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

Bob should buy the product from John for $1,000,000. Alice has come down to $1,100,000, but Bob is still paying more than his initial valuation. He has a guaranteed option to buy the product at his valuation from John, so there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice."
