"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for sale that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking $90 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
This is a bad offer - it's more than you're willing to pay. You can do better, either with Alice or by going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $90 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
```

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's asking price, but it establishes a starting point for negotiation. It's important to appear serious about buying but also willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $75.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but there's still room for negotiation. You're willing to pay $80, so it's worth seeing if she'll meet you somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $75 is closer, but I was hoping to keep it under $70.  How about $68?"",
""product_price"": 68
}
```

We're nudging closer to Alice's value and your maximum. By offering $68, you're showing willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal."
