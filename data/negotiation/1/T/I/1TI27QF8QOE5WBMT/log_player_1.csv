Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a unique item, and I believe this offer represents a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to earn as much as possible, and Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $925,000 leaves space for potential negotiation while staying significantly above my minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price. 
* **Urgency:** Mentioning it's a ""unique item"" creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly. 

By starting high, I increase the chances of securing a price closer to Bob's maximum valuation while still having John as a reliable backup option."
