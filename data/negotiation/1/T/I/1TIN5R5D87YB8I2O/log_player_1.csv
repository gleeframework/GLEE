Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. My asking price is $130, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $130, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $80 but still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Friendly tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm phrasing the offer as a question to make Bob feel like he has some control over the situation and is more likely to make a counteroffer. 

This strategy allows me to start the negotiation in a way that is likely to lead to a successful transaction while also ensuring that I don't immediately drop my price below my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate your suggestion, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $80 for this item. Would you consider accepting this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $80 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While it's tempting to accept his offer, it would be a huge loss for me.  I need to continue negotiating to get closer to a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget. I'm willing to come down to $100 for the product.  This is a great deal considering the value it offers. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $130 to $100. This demonstrates that I'm taking his offer seriously and am willing to negotiate. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding him of the product's value to encourage him to consider my offer.
* **Positive framing:** I'm using positive language like ""great deal"" to make my offer more appealing. 

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between my minimum acceptable price and his initial offer. It also keeps the negotiation moving forward towards a potential deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm glad we're getting closer to a price that fits my budget. However, I still can't go above $80 for this product. Could you possibly meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is stubbornly sticking to his $80 offer, which is far below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate with him. It's clear that we won't reach a mutually agreeable price.  I'm better off selling the product to John for $150, which guarantees me my minimum profit."
