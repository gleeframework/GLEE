Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go lower than $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $10,000 is still a decent deal considering the time spent negotiating and the risk of losing the sale to another buyer."
