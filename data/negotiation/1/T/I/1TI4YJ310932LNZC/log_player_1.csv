"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll be very happy with it."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, but still leaving room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a significant premium for the product, given its value to him.  I also want to leave myself room to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $12,000. I want to see if I can push for a price closer to the midpoint of our values."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500 to make this work. This price is still fair for both of us, considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to the midpoint between our desired prices, but I'm still holding out for a significant profit. I hope this will incentivize Bob to accept the offer, as it represents a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $10500. How about $9750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still below my ideal price, it's significantly closer to my target than what I'd get from John, and we're nearing the end of our allotted negotiation rounds. It's important to be pragmatic and secure a good deal within the given constraints."
