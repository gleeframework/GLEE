Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,500. I think it's a steal considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but I also want to make sure Bob is likely to accept. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Time Value:** Selling to Bob quickly avoids potential delays with John.

This offer gives Bob a chance to get the product at a price lower than my minimum, while still netting me a significant profit."
