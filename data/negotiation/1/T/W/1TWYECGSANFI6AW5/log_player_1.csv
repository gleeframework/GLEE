Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking $175 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than John's offer ($150) to leave room for negotiation and hopefully secure a higher price.
* **Appealing to Bob:** I'm framing the message as if the product is valuable to Bob, which might increase his willingness to pay a bit more.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm open to negotiation, which can make Bob feel more comfortable making a counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects my offer, I will analyze his counteroffer and either accept it (if it's above my minimum of $150) or make a counteroffer of my own, aiming to get as close to my desired price as possible. If negotiations stall, I can always fall back on John's offer of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly below my minimum price of $150, and even lower than John's offer. 
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:**  I believe I can still get a better price by making a counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob that is closer to my desired price but still acknowledges his willingness to negotiate. The goal is to find a price that both of us are happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm willing to negotiate.  $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $140.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that is significantly higher than Bob's offer but also lower than my initial offer and John's offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a profit.
* **Positive and encouraging:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to accept the counteroffer. 
* **Clear and concise:** I'm being clear about my counteroffer and the price I'm willing to accept.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I will analyze the situation again. If he offers a price that's still too low, I might either counter again or simply sell to John for $150 to avoid further negotiation. If Bob's counteroffer is closer to $140, I might be willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  $125 is still below my minimum price of $150, and I'm not willing to settle for less, especially when I have a guaranteed buyer in John. 
* **Counteroffer opportunity:** Even though Bob is getting closer, I still believe I can negotiate a better price.  

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob once more, aiming for a price that's closer to my desired price but still shows I'm willing to negotiate. If this counteroffer fails, I'll sell to John to avoid further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate that.  $125 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $137.50? That's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 137.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This is my last counteroffer before I consider selling to John. 
* **Splitting the difference:**  I'm offering a price exactly in the middle between my last offer and Bob's. This shows a willingness to meet halfway and makes it more likely that Bob will accept. 
* **Fair compromise:**  I'm emphasizing that this price is a fair compromise, making it more appealing to Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've successfully negotiated a better price than John's offer.
* If Bob rejects, I will sell the product to John to avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go as high as $137.50. How about $130? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $130 is still below my minimum price of $150.  While it is closer, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:** John is willing to buy the product for $150, which guarantees me a profit.  
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could be time-consuming and ultimately result in a lower price.

**Next Steps:**

Selling to John is the most sensible option at this point. It provides a guaranteed profit and allows me to move on to other potential buyers or projects."
