"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product that I think you'll really like. Would you like to make a deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is the best option. Here's why:

* **Accepting saves money:** Buying from Alice at $140 is cheaper than John's $150 price.
* **It meets your budget:** $140 is within your $150 limit."
