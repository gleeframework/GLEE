Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $15,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is the absolute maximum I can afford.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price considering the value this product offers."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable going above $9,000. This is a fair compromise considering my budget.  If you're not willing to come down further, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to meet my minimum price. Selling to John guarantees I get my desired amount without further negotiation."
