"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is likely much higher. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  It's worth $800,000 to her, and she's asking for $900,000. There's plenty of room for negotiation.  It's better to reject and make a counteroffer to see if we can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  It's a good price for both of us, and we can close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start Low:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, showing a strong desire to negotiate.
* **Fairness:** While lower than Alice's offer, it's still above her perceived value of the product, leaving room for a potential compromise. 
* **Time Pressure:** The message emphasizes a quick close, creating a sense of urgency for Alice to consider the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $750,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $825,000 is still too high. I want to keep pushing for a lower price. It's worth continuing to negotiate, especially since there's still room for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not there yet.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to get a good deal. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer is almost exactly in the middle of Alice's last offer and my previous one, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Finality:** The message implies this is a final offer, increasing the pressure on Alice to accept.
* **Value Justification:** I've highlighted the fairness of the price, reminding Alice of the product's value."
