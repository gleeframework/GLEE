"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is likely much higher.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  It's a good price for both of us, and we can close the deal quickly.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $750,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value you place on the product.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not there yet.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to get a good deal. Let's close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
