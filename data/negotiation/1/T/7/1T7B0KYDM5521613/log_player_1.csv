I'm starting high with $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, and it's a good starting point to see how much Bob values the product. If he rejects, I can gauge his interest and adjust my counteroffer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

$1,000,000 is far too low.  I need to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still a considerable amount of money, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this price will be attractive enough to Bob, but also not so low that it's immediately accepted.  This way, I have more room to negotiate in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is acceptable, but John is also offering the same price.  Since I can sell to John immediately, there's no reason to continue negotiating with Bob.  I'll take the guaranteed sale to John and move on."
