"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,200,000. I believe it's worth more than that, so I'm going to try and negotiate a higher price with Bob."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is too low, and I'm not willing to risk further negotiation that might result in an even lower price.  I'll take John's offer of $1,200,000 to ensure I get a price that is closer to my minimum."
