"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product looks great, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $14,000 is still a bit much for me.  How about $11,500? ",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, you're getting closer! I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $13,000? This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",13000.0,Alice,5,
