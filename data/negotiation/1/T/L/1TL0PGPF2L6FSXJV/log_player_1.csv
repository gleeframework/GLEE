"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $150. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $120 is significantly higher than your minimum of $80, giving you some room to negotiate.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** By offering a price below Bob's estimated value, you increase the chances of him accepting. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:** The message is straightforward and includes the offer price, making it easy for Bob to understand.

Remember, your goal is to maximize your profit while still getting Bob to accept. We'll see how Bob reacts to your first offer!"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. It's still a good deal for me, and I'm willing to make a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below the target profit margin you initially aimed for. You are looking to maximize your earnings. 

Rejecting the offer allows you to maintain control and potentially secure a higher price in future rounds. You can counter with a slightly lower price than your initial offer, aiming to close the gap between your desired price and Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $105. That's still a great deal for you considering how much value it holds for you."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still remaining above your minimum.
* **Maintain Value:** By offering a price closer to your initial offer, you maintain the perceived value of your product.
* **Focus on the Deal:** Highlighting the value for Bob reinforces the idea of a mutually beneficial deal.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground, encouraging Bob to accept while ensuring you get closer to your desired price."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $100 is a good compromise. It's above your minimum of $80, and it's within the price range you were aiming for. Accepting his offer ensures a quick and profitable sale, rather than risking further negotiations that might drag on or result in a lower price."
