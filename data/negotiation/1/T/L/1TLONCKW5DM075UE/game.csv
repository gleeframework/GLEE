"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being willing to work with me, but $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to sell it for, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",13800.0,Alice,3,
