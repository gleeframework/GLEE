Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $9,500 is more than your minimum of $8,000, so you'd be making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $10,000, so there's room to bargain without jeopardizing your minimum acceptable price.
* **It shows you're serious:**  By offering a price close to your desired outcome, you demonstrate that you're not simply throwing out a lowball offer. 

Remember, the goal is to get the highest possible price. If Bob rejects, you'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make another counteroffer. Always be ready to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a little less. I'd be willing to pay $8500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's offer, it's still below your desired profit margin.  Rejecting his offer allows you to:

* **Counteroffer:** You can propose a price closer to your ideal $9,500.  This gives you a better chance of securing a more favorable price.
* **Negotiate:** Rejecting the offer demonstrates that you're not desperate for a quick sale. This allows you to continue negotiating and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to send a counteroffer to Bob. Consider a price that's slightly lower than your initial offer, but still above your minimum acceptable price. For example, you could offer $9,000.  Be prepared to continue the negotiation process if needed."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate but not at the expense of your profit. 
* **Fairness:** Offering a price midway between your previous offer and Bob's offer creates a sense of fairness. 
* **Clear Communication:**  The message is friendly and concise, re-iterating Bob's desire for a good deal and highlighting your willingness to compromise.

**Next Steps:**

* **Wait for Bob's response:** Analyze his counteroffer or acceptance and proceed accordingly. 
* **Prepare for further negotiation:** Be ready to adjust your counteroffer or accept Bob's offer if it aligns with your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Remember John:**  Always keep John's offer of $8,000 in mind as your safety net."
