"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $1,350,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,200,000.  This would give us both a fair deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
