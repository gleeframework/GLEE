Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Your goal is to save money.**  $90 is still too high for you.
* **There are more rounds to go.**  You can try to negotiate a lower price. 
* **John's price is your fallback option.** You know you can get the product for $120 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start low:** A significant drop from Alice's initial offer will show your seriousness about negotiating.
* **Still within your range:** $75 is within your budget and leaves some room for compromise.
* **Leave room for Alice to counter:**  A counteroffer will likely come, but you've set a lower benchmark."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is moving closer to your desired price.**  $85 is better than $90, but it's still higher than what you'd like to pay.
* **There are still rounds left.** You have time to continue negotiating and try to push the price down further.
* **John's price is a safety net.** You know you can get the product elsewhere for $120 if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meet Alice halfway:**  This shows your willingness to compromise while still getting a good deal.
* **Close to Alice's value:** $80 is likely close to what Alice considers a reasonable price for her product. 
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to finalize the deal at this price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your target:** $82 is very close to your desired price range. 
* **Limited rounds remaining:** You've already spent several rounds and it's unlikely you'll get a significantly lower price.
* **Risk of John's offer:**  If you keep rejecting, you risk having to buy from John at a much higher price. 

By accepting this offer, you secure the product for a good price, minimizing your risk and maximizing your savings."
