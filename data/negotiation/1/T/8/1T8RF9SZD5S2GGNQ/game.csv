"Alice, your initial offer of $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for this product, considering its potential value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize your perspective on the value, my assessment of the product's potential is significantly higher.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  I believe this price point better reflects the true value and potential returns this product offers.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you believe this product has a high potential, but $1,800,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000, reflecting a significant compromise on my part.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it represents a fair and attractive price for a product with such potential.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $1,600,000 is getting closer to my budget, I'm still unable to go that high.  I'm willing to offer $1,500,000.  This is my final offer, and I truly believe it reflects a fair compromise for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
