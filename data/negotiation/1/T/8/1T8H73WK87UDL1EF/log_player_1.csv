"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a unique opportunity with a lot of potential. I'm confident you'll see its value. My asking price is $1,200,000. Let's discuss!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Opening with a high price ($1,200,000) sets a strong initial baseline and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the product's value, creating a positive first impression.
* **Open to Discussion:** The message shows willingness to negotiate, leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer. 
* **Plan B:**  While this is a high offer,  I have John as a backup buyer at $800,000, providing a safety net.  

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while keeping the negotiation open and encouraging Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value of the Product:**  I value the product at no less than $800,000.  
* **Negotiation Room:** While Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer, there's still room to negotiate for a higher price.
* **Exploring Options:** I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price range before selling to John. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'll likely counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but higher than Bob's offer, aiming for a compromise. 

By rejecting Bob's offer and proceeding to the next round, I'm taking a calculated risk, hoping to secure a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This gives us both a fair deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer of $1,050,000 represents a compromise between my initial offer of $1,200,000 and Bob's offer of $900,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Fair Deal:** I frame the counteroffer as a ""fair deal"" for both parties. This can make the offer more appealing to Bob. 
* **Emphasis on Negotiation:**  The message reinforces the idea that we are working together to reach an agreement. 

By offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum, I'm trying to incentivize him to accept and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  Let's try $975,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it's getting us closer to an agreement.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  My counteroffer of $975,000 is only $25,000 above Bob's latest offer, demonstrating a genuine effort to close the gap.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Round 7

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:** This offer is only $15,000 above Bob's latest offer, signaling a strong desire to close the deal.

* **Urgency:**  The message adds a sense of urgency, suggesting that it's time to reach an agreement.
* **Backup Plan:** I'm prepared to sell to John if Bob rejects this offer, putting pressure on him to accept.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final concession, but $940000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to try to get even closer to my target price. Can we meet at $920000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  We're nearing the end of the negotiation process. I have only 3 rounds left. 
* **Value of the Product:** Bob's latest offer of $920,000 is only $20,000 above John's offer of $800,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The risk of continuing to negotiate is that Bob may not budge further, and I'll be forced to sell to John at a lower price.  The reward is minimal, with a potential gain of just $20,000.
* **Guaranteed Minimum:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price of $800,000.

Given the limited time and the small potential gain from further negotiation, it's more prudent to sell to John and secure a guaranteed price. This minimizes the risk of losing money if negotiations fail."
