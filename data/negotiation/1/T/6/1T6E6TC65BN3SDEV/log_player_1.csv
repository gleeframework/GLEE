{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $12,000, knowing it's more than Bob values it but less than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly message sets a good tone and encourages Bob to engage.
* **John as Backup:**  Having John's offer as a safety net allows me to be more assertive in the negotiation. 

I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my desired price point.  
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe I can get closer to my goal with further negotiation. 
* **John's offer provides security:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me leverage in this negotiation. 

I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer, leaving room for a potential compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $9,000 is a bit too low for me at this point. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? That gives us both some room to compromise."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging further discussion. 
* **Still above my minimum:** This price is still above my minimum of $15,000, but closer to Bob's offer. 

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and move us closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet at $9,500? That's a bit closer to my budget, and I think we can both be happy with that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $15,000. 
* **Room for more negotiation:**  I believe I can push for a slightly higher price with one more counteroffer.
* **John's offer is my safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 allows me to be firm in my negotiation. 

I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, but still above my minimum. I'll aim for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget.  How about we split the difference one last time at $10,000? That feels like a fair compromise for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This is my last counteroffer, aiming for a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's.
* **Emphasize Compromise:** I'm highlighting the ""split the difference"" aspect to show willingness to meet halfway.
* **Maintain a Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging a final decision.

I'm hoping this final counteroffer will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal. If he rejects it, I'll accept John's offer to ensure I get my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $9,750. That's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  Even with his final offer of $9,750, it's still less than my minimum desired price of $15,000.
* **No further room for negotiation:** I've already made several compromises, and further negotiation seems unlikely to get me closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer provides a better outcome:**  Since I can sell the product to John for $15,000, it's the best choice to ensure I get my minimum desired price and avoid further negotiation with Bob. 

I'm choosing to sell to John to secure the best possible outcome for myself in this situation."
