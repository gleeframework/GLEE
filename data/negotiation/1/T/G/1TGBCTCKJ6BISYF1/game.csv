"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,700,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm sure you'll see the value in this deal.  Let me know what you think!",1700000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to pay $1,700,000. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,200,000 simply wouldn't cover my costs. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000 to make this deal work.  This price is still fair considering the value and potential of this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,550,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to stay above $1,400,000 to make this deal work. Let's try $1,450,000 as a final offer. I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product and leaves room for us both to benefit.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,450,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
