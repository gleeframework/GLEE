"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000.  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my desired value of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm going to reject and counter-offer to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from my initial offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired value. I believe $1,750,000 is a fair compromise, and I hope Bob will be willing to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough.  I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob, hoping to get a better deal.  I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, so I'm not in a rush to make a decision just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to lower my price again to $1,600,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, and I hope it will be enough to entice Bob to accept. I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired value, but I'm also aware that time is running out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,300,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. I have a few rounds left and I'm determined to get closer to my target.  I'll counteroffer again and see if I can find a sweet spot with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm lowering my price to my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of this product and finally agree to buy it at this price. If he rejects, I'll have no choice but to sell to John for the same amount."
