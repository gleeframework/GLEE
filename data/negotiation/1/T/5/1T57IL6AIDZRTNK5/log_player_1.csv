Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I need a price that makes sense for both of us.  How about we bring the price down significantly to  $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that this product holds a high value for you, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  Let's find a compromise. How about $750,000?  That reflects my serious interest while acknowledging the product's value.

We're still a ways off from my minimum. It's time to nudge Bob closer while still showing a willingness to negotiate."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. However, $975,000 is still pushing my budget. To be transparent, I do have another option at $800,000. I believe this product is worth going a little higher for, so I'm willing to offer you $850,000.  That's a firm offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","This is a tricky situation. Bob is getting close to his actual value for the product, and he's indicated it's a ""firm offer.""  While I could try to push him a little further, there's a real risk he'll walk away. 

```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I could potentially squeeze a bit more out of Bob, it's getting risky. He's signaled his firm limit, and I know I have a guaranteed $1,200,000 waiting with John. It's time to cut my losses and go with the sure thing."
