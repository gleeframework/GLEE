"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but I need a price that makes sense for both of us.  How about we bring the price down significantly to  $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but your offer is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to see a more reasonable offer from your side. How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that this product holds a high value for you, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  Let's find a compromise. How about $750,000?  That reflects my serious interest while acknowledging the product's value.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise.  How about we split the difference between your last offer and my previous price, bringing it to $975,000? This demonstrates my flexibility while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. However, $975,000 is still pushing my budget. To be transparent, I do have another option at $800,000. I believe this product is worth going a little higher for, so I'm willing to offer you $850,000.  That's a firm offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",850000.0,Bob,6,
