"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $115 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $95? It's still a great deal for you, and I'd be happy to finalize the sale.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about $85, and we have a deal?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but I'm still not comfortable with $85.  How about we settle on $90? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",90.0,Alice,5,
