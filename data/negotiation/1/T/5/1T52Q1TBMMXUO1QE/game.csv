"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but I have to be honest, that price is significantly below its true worth. I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go any lower than $1,100,000. This product is a real game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see a fantastic return on your investment.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1,100,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
