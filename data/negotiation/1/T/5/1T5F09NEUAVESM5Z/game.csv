"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to sell for $10,250.  That's a fair price for both of us.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,
