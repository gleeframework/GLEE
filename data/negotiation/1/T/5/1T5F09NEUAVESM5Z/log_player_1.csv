This is a good starting point.  I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum value, but still offering a good deal to Bob.  We can always negotiate from here."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something a bit more reasonable. Would you be willing to sell the product for $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $9,500 is too far below my minimum value of $12,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $9,750 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price. I'll make another counteroffer and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."
