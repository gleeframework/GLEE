Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below your guaranteed price ($119) creates a sense of urgency and potential savings for Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this offer is close to your minimum, it leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very interested. 

This approach aims to balance getting the highest possible price from Bob while ensuring you don't lose out on the guaranteed sale to John."
