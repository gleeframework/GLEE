"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think will be of great interest to you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. This is a great price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts!",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $7,000 for it. What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial price. How about $8,500?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but $8,500 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I'm happy to keep working towards a deal. I'm still not comfortable with $7,750, but I'm willing to come down to $8,250. This is a fair compromise that I think we can both agree on. What do you say?",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be completely transparent, I've found a similar product elsewhere for $8,000.  I'd prefer to work with you, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Would you be willing to match that price?  It would allow me to close the deal today.",8000.0,Bob,6,
