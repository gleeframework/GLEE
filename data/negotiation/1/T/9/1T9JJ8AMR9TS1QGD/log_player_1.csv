Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but I am only able to offer $15000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $15,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'm going to counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to let it go for $17,500.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 17500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm willing to consider $16500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $16,500 is a good price, and I'm getting closer to my original asking price. It's also better than selling to John for $15,000, and we're getting closer to the end of the negotiation rounds."
