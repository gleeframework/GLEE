"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We start with a strong offer ($1,300,000) closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) than our minimum ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** The message is framed as a starting point for discussion, encouraging Bob to reveal his position and flexibility.
* **Alternative Option:**  We keep the John option ($800,000) in mind as a fallback if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly higher than our minimum selling price ($800,000). There's room for negotiation.
* **Testing the Waters:** By rejecting this offer, we signal that we value the product higher and encourage Bob to potentially increase his offer in the next round.
* **John as Backup:** We retain the option to sell to John for a guaranteed $800,000 if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I recognize that your offer is serious, the value this product brings is truly significant.  Could you consider $1,175,000? This feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1175000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We decrease our asking price but not drastically. A $125,000 drop shows flexibility but maintains our position that the product is highly valuable. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:** We aim for a price point closer to the middle ground between Bob's last offer ($1,000,000) and our previous ask ($1,300,000).
* **Justification:**  We re-emphasize the product's value to justify the higher price, hoping to anchor Bob's perception of its worth. 
* **John Option:**  While we're making progress with Bob, we still keep the John option open in case Bob's counteroffer in the next round is unacceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. I'm getting closer to a number I'm comfortable with, how about $1,075,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is a substantial profit ($275,000) over our minimum price ($800,000). 
* **Positive Trend:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating a strong desire for the product. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate aggressively could risk losing the deal altogether. It's unlikely we'll get much closer to the $1,175,000 mark without Bob becoming discouraged.  

By accepting now, we secure a great price and avoid the potential risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
