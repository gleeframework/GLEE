,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1,250,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $900,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a fair price considering your potential gains.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,050,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to benefit from the deal.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget limit, but I still think $1,150,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and make a deal.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within your budget constraints. I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",1125000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying from John.",1100000.0,Bob,8,
