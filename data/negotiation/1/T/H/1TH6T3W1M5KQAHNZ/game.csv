"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not sure I can meet your starting price. I've done some research and I believe the product is worth less than you think. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,025,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your perspective.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,025,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $975,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm hoping we can find common ground at this price. What do you think?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a price that works for us both. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I believe in giving you a fair chance.  How about we settle at $1,000,000 even? This is my final offer, as I need to move forward with one of the buyers soon.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have another buyer interested, but I'm still willing to work with you. I'm not willing to go up to $1,000,000, and I think $975,000 is a fair price. I'm not budging from this price, so I'll stick with my previous offer. Can you meet me at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,6,
