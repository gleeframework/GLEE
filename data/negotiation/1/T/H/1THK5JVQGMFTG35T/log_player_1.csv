Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm willing to make a concession to start the negotiation, but I'm not willing to go too low. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,000.  Let me know if that works for you.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  I'd be willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers at $9,750. This feels like a fair compromise to me.
