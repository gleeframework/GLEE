"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm willing to make a concession to start the negotiation, but I'm not willing to go too low. What do you think?

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $10,500.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,750 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm counteroffering at $10,200.

It's time to cut bait and go with John. Alice is very unlikely to go below $10,000 and we're already at the point where we can get the product for our target price from John."
