"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $800000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $600000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $600000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll offer you a counteroffer of $700000. This is the best price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $700000. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $650000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it's within my budget.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $650000 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be closer to my original offer. I'll counter with $675000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",675000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but $675000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $620000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and find a mutually beneficial price.",620000.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $590000. I'm willing to walk away if this isn't acceptable to you, but I'm still interested in the product.",590000.0,Bob,8,
