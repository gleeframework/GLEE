"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is still a fair price considering the product's value to you and my desired profit margin.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? This would be a good deal for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
