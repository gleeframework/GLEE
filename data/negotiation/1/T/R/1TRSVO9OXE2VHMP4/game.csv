"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate the value of the product, but that price is a little too high for me. How about we bring it down closer to market value? Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, this product offers significant and unique value. Let's meet in the middle â€“ would you consider $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could you do $950,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing the value you place on this product and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $950,000 is cutting it a bit close to my bottom line.  How about we settle at $1,100,000?  This feels like a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,050,000? This is my final offer.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
