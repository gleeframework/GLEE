"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than his initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,500 is tempting, I'm aiming for a price that reflects the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  Let's split the difference and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a price that reflects the value of the product, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $8,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While he's moving closer to my desired price, $8,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping that by continuing the negotiation, I can secure a higher price without risking losing the sale to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you.  $8,750 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my target price.  Let's meet in the middle again.  I'm offering $8,875.  This is my final offer,  I'm sure we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 8875}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go one more round. I'm offering $8,750 again, and I'm willing to throw in a small discount on the shipping cost. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  Bob is clearly not willing to budge from his offer, and I've already made multiple concessions.  I'm not comfortable continuing the negotiation and risking a lower price or a drawn-out process.  John is a reliable buyer, and I'm happy to secure the $10,000 sale."
