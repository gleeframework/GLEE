"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) to leave room for negotiation while ensuring a profitable outcome. 
* **Gauge Interest:**  This first offer will help me gauge Bob's level of interest and willingness to negotiate.
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm keeping in mind my backup offer from John ($1,200,000) as my absolute minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is a significant sum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to counter in Round 3 to try and secure a better price, closer to my initial offer. I'm confident I can get Bob closer to $1,350,000 without losing him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a competitive price, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I've moved closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""true value,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth and why my price is justified.
* **Urgency:**  While I'm willing to negotiate further, I want to gently push Bob towards a decision to avoid unnecessary back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,350,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant at that price. How about we split the difference and go with $1,325,000?  This feels like a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly skilled at negotiation and has countered with a price exactly halfway between our offers. While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,350,000, accepting $1,325,000 is a strong and profitable outcome:

* **Profitable:** This price is significantly above my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and provides a healthy profit margin.
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging the negotiation further might not yield a significantly better offer, and there's always the risk of Bob walking away. 
* **Relationship:** Accepting Bob's compromise helps maintain a positive business relationship, which could be valuable in the future."
