"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a competitive price, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,350,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant at that price. How about we split the difference and go with $1,325,000?  This feels like a fair compromise for both of us.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
