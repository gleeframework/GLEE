"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $130 is less than Alice's value of $150, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $120.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to get the price as close to his maximum budget as possible. Offering $110 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, leaving room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $125 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still slightly higher.  Bob should continue to negotiate and see if he can get a lower price.  Since he can get the product from John for $120, he's not desperate to accept this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now offering a price that is halfway between his last offer and Alice's current offer. This shows that he is willing to compromise and is hopeful that Alice will accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $122 is only $2 less than what Bob can get from John. At this point, it's not worth continuing the negotiation. There are only 5 rounds left, and even if Bob gets a lower offer from Alice, it's unlikely to be significantly lower than John's price.  It's best for Bob to secure the product from John and avoid the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice within the remaining rounds."
