Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim for a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) to maximize your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 gives you leverage in negotiations with Bob.  

**Why this strategy works:**

This offer balances your desire for a high price with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. It's a strong opening move in the negotiation."
