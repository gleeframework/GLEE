Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum, giving me room to negotiate, but still competitive given Bob's value for the product. I'm also including a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum, but it's still a good starting point for negotiation. I'm going to reject it and make a counteroffer to try and get a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can find some common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,520,000. I think that's a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,520,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,520,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is slightly below my minimum, but it's very close.  It's also a good compromise, and I'm confident I can get a better deal if I keep negotiating. However, there's a risk he might walk away. Accepting his offer is the best course of action for now."
