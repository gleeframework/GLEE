Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's  above my minimum threshold of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more than the $8,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is closer to my ideal price, I believe I can still get closer to $10,000. I'm going to counteroffer to see if I can get him to budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering $9,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his last offer, but still higher than my floor price. I hope this will encourage him to agree without further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would ideally prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $9,200 is a decent compromise.  It's significantly more than the $8,000 I could get from John, and it's likely that further negotiation will only prolong the process without guaranteeing a much higher offer.  I'm accepting Bob's offer to finalize the deal."
