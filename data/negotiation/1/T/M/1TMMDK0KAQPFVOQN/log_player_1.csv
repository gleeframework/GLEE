Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $13,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation, and hopefully, Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. Would you consider lowering the price to $10,000? I believe this might be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still too low for me.  I believe the product is worth more, and I want to see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob. I'm going to try a counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $10,000 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to drop the price to $11,500. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, I am proposing a price of $10,000 for the product. This aligns more closely with my financial capabilities. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and at this point, it seems unlikely he will budge. Given that I can get the same price from John, it makes more sense to go with the guaranteed sale and move on."
