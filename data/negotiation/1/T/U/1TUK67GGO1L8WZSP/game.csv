"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $130. It's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $115. It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the sale.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to come down another $5 and offer you the product for $125. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
