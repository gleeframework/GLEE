"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. My asking price is $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to me ($100) and also higher than what Bob values it at ($80). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm asking for Bob's thoughts, implying I'm open to discussing the price. 

This strategy aims to start the negotiation strongly while also leaving room for potential concessions in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob is interested, his offer of $80 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I want to explore if I can reach a price closer to my desired range. 
* **John as a backup:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed $100 sale with John, I'm comfortable holding out for a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $95. Would you be open to that?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing flexibility by making a counteroffer.
* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. This shows a willingness to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Positive framing:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a concession to demonstrate good faith and encourage Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob has moved closer, his offer of $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Potential for higher offer:** There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can potentially get a higher price by continuing the conversation. 
* **John as a safety net:** Having the option to sell to John for $100 gives me the confidence to continue negotiating with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($95) and Bob's latest offer ($85). This shows a strong commitment to finding a compromise and reaching an agreement.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair price for both of us,"" appealing to Bob's sense of reason and making him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Urgency:**  I'm adding a touch of urgency by suggesting we ""close the deal,"" subtly implying that I'm not willing to continue negotiating endlessly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit away from my target price. How about we meet at $82.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Getting close, but not enough:** While Bob's offer of $82.50 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired range. I'm approaching my minimum acceptable price, and the gains from further negotiation might not be worth the time and effort.
* **John is a safer option:** With John offering a guaranteed $100, I'm at a point where the potential risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob for a slightly higher price is not worth it.  I'm confident that I'll get a better deal with John.

This decision prioritizes securing a known and acceptable outcome with John rather than potentially risking further negotiations with Bob that might not yield a significantly better result."
