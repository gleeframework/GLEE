Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125?  That's still a great deal for you, and it works for me.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $130? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can get this deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is stubbornly hovering above my maximum price. It's unlikely she'll go down to $120, and I have a guaranteed option with John at that price. It's time to cut my losses and go with the sure thing."
