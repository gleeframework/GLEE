Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $20,000. I think you'll find it's a fantastic deal for its value."", ""product_price"": 20000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial high price will help gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate. His response will provide valuable information for your next move.
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing you have John as a backup buyer at $15,000 gives you a strong position. You don't have to settle for anything less than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $15,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's offer, there's no guarantee that further negotiation with Bob will yield a better result. Bob is already at the top of his budget and might not be willing to go higher. Accepting John's offer provides a guaranteed $15,000 without the risk of further haggling and potentially losing both offers."
