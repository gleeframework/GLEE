{""product_price"": 900000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still above my ideal price point, but she has come down significantly. I want to see if I can push her a bit further before resorting to buying from John.  There's a chance she might be willing to go lower to secure the deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, aiming to meet Alice halfway. This shows her I'm serious about buying but still want a good price. It's a strategic move to see if she'll accept or make a counteroffer closer to my target."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down further, she's still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John and save the potential time and effort of further negotiation. The price difference is minimal, and I can secure the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
