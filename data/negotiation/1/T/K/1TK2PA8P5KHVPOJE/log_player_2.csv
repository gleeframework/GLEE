"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is continuing to compromise and is now offering a price that is closer to Alice's last offer. This is a strategic move to show Alice that he is serious about buying the product, but also to test if he can get the price lower. He's still within his acceptable price range, but only slightly."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $100 is still above Bob's maximum value of $80. While he could continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice might reject further offers, and he's already gone through several rounds.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $80, ensuring a deal within his budget and saving time."
