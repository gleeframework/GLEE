"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. How about $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $85 is a good price, but I was thinking more along the lines of $87.50. It's a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",87.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $87.50 is still a little too high for me.  How about we split the difference at $86.25? ",86.25,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $86.25 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $88? It's a fair price that works for both of us.",88.0,Alice,5,
