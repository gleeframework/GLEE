"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $1,450,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still confident I can get more. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,250,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hopeful I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob.  There are still 6 rounds left, and I'm not ready to settle for the minimum just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 1350000}

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,275,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still have time to negotiate. With 4 rounds left, I can still try to push for a better price, but I'll be keeping a close eye on the clock and the risk of having to settle with John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1325000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,325,000. This is a slight increase from his previous offer and shows that I'm willing to compromise but I'm still hoping to close the deal at a price that's closer to my ideal target.  It's getting close to the end, so I'll need to be careful about how much I'm willing to give up."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,290,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. With only 2 rounds left, I'm running out of time. While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,290,000 is still a good deal and significantly better than selling to John. I need to prioritize closing the deal and securing a profit."
