Alice's offer:

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her previous offer, it's still higher than his maximum budget. He should try to counteroffer again, hoping to get closer to his target price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $10750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10875? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's offer of $10,875 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. Since John is willing to sell the product for $10,000, it's the most cost-effective option for Bob."
