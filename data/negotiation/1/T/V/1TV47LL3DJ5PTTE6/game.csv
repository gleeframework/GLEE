"I'm really interested in the product, but I think $15,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,000, but I'm still a bit far from that. Can we try to meet in the middle from the original offer? I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this product. Let's close this gap. How about $11,500? That's me coming down significantly from my original ask.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from that, so I'll offer $11,250 for the product. That's my best and final offer.",11250.0,Bob,6,
