"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is a good price, you can potentially do better. You know the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is higher than your initial counteroffer, but it's still above your ideal price. It's worth continuing to negotiate since you know Alice is willing to sell below $9,200."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now getting close to your maximum price of $10,000.  There's a risk of getting stuck in a negotiation loop with Alice where she continues to raise her price. It's safer and more efficient to buy the product from John at $10,000, ensuring you get the product within your budget."
