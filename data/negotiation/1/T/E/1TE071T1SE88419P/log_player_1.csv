"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90. This is slightly above Bob's value for the product, but it leaves room for negotiation. I believe this is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I will reject Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum value of $80.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $85. This is a compromise between my minimum value of $80 and Bob's last offer of $75. I believe this is a fair price that will allow us to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I will accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer a slightly higher price, Bob's offer of $80 meets my minimum value. It's also important to consider the risk of further negotiation â€“ I could risk losing Bob completely and having to settle for John's offer of $80.  Accepting now ensures a guaranteed sale at my minimum value."
