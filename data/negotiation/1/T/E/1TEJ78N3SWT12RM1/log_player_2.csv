"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Since you are willing to pay $15,000 for the product, and Alice is offering it at that price, it makes sense to accept her offer. You get the product for your maximum price and don't need to go through John."
