"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is still a good deal, considering its value to you is $8,000.",9000.0,Alice,3,
