{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than my minimum acceptable price, but leaves room for negotiation and still allows for a good profit. It also includes a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $50 for it. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I will counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate you're interested, but $50 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100.  How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 100}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $70? That's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $70 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not enough. I'm not ready to give up this much profit. I will counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $70 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $90, but that's my final offer. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
