{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me a decent margin while still being a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is better than $100, I'm not willing to settle for that price yet. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves me with a decent profit. I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has come up slightly from his previous offer, and I'm close enough to my desired price that I'm willing to accept.  $125 is a good outcome."
