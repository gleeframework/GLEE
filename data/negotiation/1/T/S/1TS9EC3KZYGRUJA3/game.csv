"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential benefits of the product.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $1,500,000 is a tempting offer, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher.  Let's find a middle ground - would you consider $1,950,000?",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but $1,950,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,725,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.",1725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product offers significant value beyond that price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,850,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,850,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to go up to $1,750,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price point.",1750000.0,Bob,6,
