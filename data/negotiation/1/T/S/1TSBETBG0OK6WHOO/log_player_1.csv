"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to secure a price closer to my initial offer or at least my minimum price.  Selling to John is always an option, but I'd prefer to try and get a better price from Bob if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a more reasonable price. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below the $1,000,000 threshold. I'm still hopeful that I can get a better price from Bob, especially since we're only in the 4th round.  Selling to John is always a fallback option, but I want to explore further negotiation with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your continued interest. However, $950,000 still doesn't work for me. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,050,000,  which is a significant compromise.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $980,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below the $1,000,000 threshold. We've reached round 6, and while I could continue negotiating with Bob, I'm worried we might not reach an agreement before the 10 rounds are up.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me my minimum price, and it's a safer option than risking a failed negotiation with Bob."
