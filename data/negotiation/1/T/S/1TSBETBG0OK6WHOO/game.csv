"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. Let's try to find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your continued interest. However, $950,000 still doesn't work for me. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,050,000,  which is a significant compromise.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
