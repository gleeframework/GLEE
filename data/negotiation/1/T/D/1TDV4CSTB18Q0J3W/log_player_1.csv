Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's worth a lot to you, and I believe it can be a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,300,000. This reflects the product's value and leaves room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but I need to keep my costs down. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,100,000? I believe this would still reflect the product's worth while allowing us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that undervalues the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this valuable product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This price reflects the product's value and gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to agree to $1,250,000. I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000. This still allows for a reasonable profit for you while keeping the cost within my budget. I hope this proposal will lead to a mutually beneficial outcome. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer from Bob.  Also,  accepting his offer allows me to close the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation or having to sell to John at the same price."
