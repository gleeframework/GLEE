"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $60 for it.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product, and $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $100.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we split the difference between my last offer and your current one? Would you be willing to do it for $80?",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite willing to meet you at $80, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise a bit more. I'll give you a deal for $110, and that's as low as I can go.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a fair price, so how about we settle at $85? That's a pretty good deal considering my budget.",85.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not going to give up yet, Bob! I think $85 is still a bit too low for me. I'll meet you in the middle again, but this time I'll go up to $105. That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",105.0,Alice,7,
