"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I believe it's well worth the price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation and maximize potential profit.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the value and opportunity of the product to encourage Bob's interest.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message signals that I'm open to discussing the price, indicating flexibility. 
* **Leaving Room for John:** This offer is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, allowing me to potentially accept a lower counteroffer from Bob without sacrificing too much profit.  However, if Bob rejects it, I can still confidently sell to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1500000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer meets my minimum acceptable price, I have 9 more rounds to potentially negotiate a better price.  I want to see if I can push for a higher value, especially given my initial offer was significantly higher.  There's a chance Bob is willing to pay more, and I want to explore that possibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I believe this product holds even greater potential for you. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  This price reflects the value I know you'll derive from this product.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by coming down from my initial $2,000,000 offer but still significantly higher than Bob's initial counteroffer.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm highlighting the potential value Bob will gain from the product, aiming to motivate him to pay more.
* **Building Momentum:**  I'm using positive language to keep the negotiation moving forward, emphasizing the possibility of a deal.

This counteroffer balances my desire for a higher price with the need to be flexible and prevent Bob from walking away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I truly value your product, but I am still working within my financial limits. I would like to propose a price of $1600000. I hope this offer is closer to what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Getting Closer:** Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is getting closer to my desired price point. 
* **Limited Rounds:** We are now at round 4 out of 10. With each round, the possibility of getting a better offer from Bob decreases.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal of $2,000,000, accepting this offer guarantees me $100,000 more than selling to John and significantly reduces the risk of Bob walking away completely.

Therefore, it's strategically beneficial to accept Bob's offer at this point."
