"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $180 is a bit high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $140. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $140 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $120. If you're not able to accept that, I might have to explore other options.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is still a bit higher than you'd like, but I'm not willing to go much lower than that. I can offer you a slight discount to $130. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the discount, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125. If you're willing to accept that, we can close the deal.  Otherwise, I'm going to have to go with another seller.",125.0,Bob,6,
