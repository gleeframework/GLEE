"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $115 is a good starting point, as it's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly approach:**  A positive message establishes a good rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open ended:** Asking ""What do you think?"" leaves the door open for further discussion and potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $85 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $120.
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe there's still potential to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to explore counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $85 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $100? This way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  Offering $100 is a compromise, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my minimum value.
* **Positive framing:** Emphasizing a ""good deal"" for both of us creates a more agreeable tone and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Clear expectation:**  By stating a specific price, I avoid further back and forth and move the negotiation forward."
