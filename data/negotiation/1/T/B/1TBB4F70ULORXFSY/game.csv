"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its value, and I believe you might be the right person for the job. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a fair price considering its worth to me, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be comfortable with the price.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm glad you're willing to make a serious offer. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to my initial price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is a significant discount from my initial price, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1100000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to be comfortable with the price. I'm counteroffering at $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to make a serious offer.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1050000 for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $950000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'm not budging from this price, so I'm sticking with my previous offer of $950000.",950000.0,Bob,6,
