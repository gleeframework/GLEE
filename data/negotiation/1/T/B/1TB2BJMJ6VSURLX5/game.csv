"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, $8,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to drop my price to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $8,800 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,400. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",9400.0,Alice,5,
