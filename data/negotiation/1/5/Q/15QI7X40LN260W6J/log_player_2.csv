"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $95, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

Alice is getting close to John's price.  At this point, it's likely better to accept the $95 to ensure you get the product and don't risk further negotiation pushing the price higher or losing the deal altogether."
