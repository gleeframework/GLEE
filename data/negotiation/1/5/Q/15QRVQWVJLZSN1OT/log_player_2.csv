# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a great deal, considering the value it brings. What do you think?

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum budget, so there's no immediate reason to accept. There's potential to negotiate a lower price, so rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better deal."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a great product, but $15,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you be willing to accept $12,000? This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 12000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $12000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $13500. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it brings. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my comfort zone. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating to see if I can get a price closer to my target of $12,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,500 is still a little more than I can spend comfortably.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,750? I'm confident this price is fair considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 12750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go up to $12750. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you the product for $13250. This is as low as I can go, considering the value it brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,250 is getting closer to my ideal price of $12,000.  While I'd prefer to negotiate further, I don't want to risk losing the deal completely. Accepting this offer is a good compromise, as it's within my budget and a significant saving compared to Alice's initial price or buying from John."
