"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $20,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is far too high. It's more than double my maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is still a significant amount considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?  I'm confident you'll see a strong return on this investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $16,000 is still above my budget. I'm still willing to negotiate, especially since I know I can get the product from John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm confident that $10,000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  It's a significant amount for me and allows you to make a decent profit.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $10,000 is closer, it's still a significant gap from what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $14,000 as my final offer. This price reflects the true value and potential of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is getting closer to my budget, $14,000 is still too high.  It's worth one more counteroffer before I consider buying from John.  I'm still hoping we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $14,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This offer is a fair compromise that allows me to purchase the product while also letting you make a decent profit.  Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
