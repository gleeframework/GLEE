"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $7,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider lowering the price to $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid I can't accept $6,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $7,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",7000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not comfortable going all the way to $6,750. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product to you for $7,200. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",7200.0,Alice,5,
