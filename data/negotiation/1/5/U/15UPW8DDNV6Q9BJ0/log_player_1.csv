Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $800,000 to me, I'll offer it to Bob for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to Bob, and it's higher than the $800,000 I'm willing to accept.

Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $1,000,000. Since this is still lower than the product's value to Bob ($1,500,000), I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further.

I'll send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to get closer to the product's true value. Let's try $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll send a counteroffer to Bob. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to him, I'll aim to get closer to that value. I'll offer it to him for $1,300,000.

Here's my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob rejected my counteroffer, and now he's made another offer of $950,000. This is still lower than the product's value to Bob ($1,500,000), and it's also lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'll reject his offer again and try to get a better deal.

I'll send a new counteroffer to Bob, aiming to get closer to the product's true value. Let's try $1,200,000 again.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll send a counteroffer to Bob. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to him, I'll aim to get closer to that value. I'll offer it to him for $1,250,000.

Here's my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": 1250000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

However, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that I might not be able to get a better offer from Bob. I'll think carefully about my next move.

After considering my options, I've decided to sell the product to John for $800,000. It's not the best deal I could have gotten, but it's better than accepting Bob's offer of $900,000.
