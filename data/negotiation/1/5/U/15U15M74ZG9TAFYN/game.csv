"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's valued at no less than $1200000 to me, but I'm willing to start negotiations at $1500000.  Let me know your thoughts!",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1200000, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $1200000 is unfortunately below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This reflects the product's true value while leaving room for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $1350000. I'm willing to pay $1250000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. Can we meet in the middle?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping to close the deal at a price that reflects the product's true value. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1300000. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1280000, which is my absolute maximum. Can we meet at this price?",1280000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  I'll accept $1290000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close the deal. Let me know your thoughts.",1290000.0,Alice,7,
