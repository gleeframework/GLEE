Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $175.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but lower than my minimum value ($150). This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a decent profit.
* **Positive Message:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The price is high enough that Bob will likely counter-offer, giving us a chance to negotiate.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! 
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counter-offer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counter-offer. 
* If the negotiation stalls, I'll move on to selling to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I'm interested in purchasing it for $150. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price. Any lower, and I'm losing money.
* **No need to risk further negotiation:** There's no guarantee that I can get a higher price from Bob. Negotiating further risks him walking away entirely, leaving me with nothing.

**By accepting, I secure my minimum profit and avoid potential losses.**"
