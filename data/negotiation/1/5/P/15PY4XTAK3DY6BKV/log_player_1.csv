Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product,  $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Let's try $850,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it allows for a good deal for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
