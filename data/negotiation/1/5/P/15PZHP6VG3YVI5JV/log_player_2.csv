Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm still not comfortable with $8,800, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $9,000, but that's the final price I'm willing to accept. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

Alice is signaling this is her final offer and we are running out of rounds.  While it would be nice to get it lower, getting the product for $9,000 is a good deal compared to John's $12,000 price."
