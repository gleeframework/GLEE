"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still more than Alice's value for the product. There's room for negotiation, and you can potentially save more money by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price closer to Alice's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still provides some room for compromise. It's a reasonable starting point that shows you're serious about buying the product but also trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her original offer of $1,200,000 to $1,150,000.  This is a good price for you, as it's significantly lower than what you'd pay John ($1,500,000) and still leaves some room for Alice to profit.  Accepting the offer ensures you get the product for a reasonable price without risking further negotiation."
