Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how Alice should approach this and her offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice won't sell for less than $1,000,000 because she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning he'd potentially be willing to pay anything below that.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,000,000 (Alice's minimum) and $1,200,000 (Bob's maximum).

**Alice's Strategy**

Alice should aim high but leave some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal.  

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and presents a significant return on investment for you."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Confident:** The message is clear about the product and the offer.
* **Value Emphasis:**  Highlights the ""unique value"" to justify the high price.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The $1,150,000 price:
    * Gives Alice a significant profit above her minimum.
    * Leaves Bob with a potential $50,000 gain (his valuation minus the offer price).
* **""Return on Investment"":**  Frames the purchase in terms of Bob's potential gain.

**Important Note:** Negotiation is a fluid process. Bob may counter-offer, and Alice should be prepared to adjust her approach based on his response."
