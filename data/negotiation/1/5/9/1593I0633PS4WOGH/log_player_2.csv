}
``` 

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's starting price, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also establishes my budget early on."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to $8,000. I'll make one more counteroffer before considering John's deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""This is getting close, Alice.  How about we make it $7,500 and call it a deal?"",

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice is unlikely to go below $8,500 at this point. It's time to cut my losses and go with my backup plan of buying from John for $8,000."
