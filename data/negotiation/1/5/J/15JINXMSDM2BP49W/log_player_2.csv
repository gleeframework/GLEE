"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a better price. You can potentially save $200,000 by negotiating, which is a significant amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a starting point for negotiation. It's a significant discount from Alice's offer but still leaves some room for her to make a profit.  You're aiming to reach a price as close to your limit as possible, while still leaving Alice with a reason to sell."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is closer to your target price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting and making another counteroffer might allow you to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, increasing the price slightly from your previous offer but still lower than Alice's latest proposal. This shows that you are willing to negotiate but also maintains pressure on Alice to lower her price further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is now higher than your initial target price and is getting closer to her initial asking price. This suggests that further negotiation might be unproductive. It's better to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which is your maximum budget and guarantees the purchase."
