Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a high price, but still leaves room for potential compromise. It is likely that Bob will counteroffer, and the negotiation can proceed from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it is still significantly less than my desired price. I will reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, lowering the price from my initial offer, but still above Bob's current offer. I am hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
