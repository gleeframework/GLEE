Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $950,000.  It's a significant investment, but I believe it's well worth it based on its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I want to see if I can push him a bit higher before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to the product's true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  This gives us both a good deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $875,000 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer, I still feel there's room to negotiate. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get him to $900,000. If he doesn't budge, I'll likely have to accept his offer or consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about we settle at $890,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it reflects the true value of the product.  Let's try to reach an agreement here."", ""product_price"": 890000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $880,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $880,000 is still a bit lower than I wanted, it's only $10,000 less than my last offer.  We're running out of rounds, and it's not worth risking losing this deal completely. I'm going to accept Bob's offer and move on."
