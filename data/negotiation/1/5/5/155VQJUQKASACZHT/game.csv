"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
