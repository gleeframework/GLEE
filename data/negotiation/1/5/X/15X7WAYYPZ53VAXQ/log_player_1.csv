Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe is worth a lot to the right person. I'm open to offers, but I'm looking to get at least $20,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the potential value of the product to Bob,  without revealing my minimum. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** By saying ""open to offers,"" I'm signaling flexibility, but I'm not giving away my minimum price yet.

This initial offer is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potentially open a dialogue about the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value might be high to you, but I am only willing to pay up to $8000 for it. Please let me know if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum of $15,000.  Selling to John for $15,000 is currently a better option, but I'm not ready to give up on Bob just yet.  By rejecting his offer, I can:

* **Test the Waters:** I can see if I can get Bob to raise his offer. 
* **Show My Resolve:**  Rejecting his offer demonstrates that I'm serious about getting a better price.
* **Maintain Control:**  This allows me to set the next counteroffer and guide the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8,000 is significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get for this product. It's a unique item with real value, and I'm confident it's worth more than that.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to lower my price to $12,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer, but I'm not accepting it.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's unique value and my confidence in its worth.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a compromise price of $12,000, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.

This counteroffer is strategic:

* **Testing Bob's Interest:** I want to see if Bob is serious about buying the product and if he's willing to increase his offer slightly.
* **Setting the Tone:** This counteroffer demonstrates that I'm not going to accept a price that's significantly lower than my minimum. 
* **Keeping Options Open:** I'm still ready to sell to John for $15,000 if this negotiation fails, but I'm giving Bob another chance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of the product, I still believe $8000 would be a fair price for it. I hope we can reach an agreement closer to this amount. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has stubbornly stuck to his initial offer of $8,000 despite my attempts to negotiate. This shows that he's not willing to budge, and I'm unlikely to get a higher price from him.  

Since John is willing to pay $15,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer, it's in my best interest to sell to John. This guarantees me a profit and avoids further negotiation with Bob, who seems unlikely to increase his offer."
