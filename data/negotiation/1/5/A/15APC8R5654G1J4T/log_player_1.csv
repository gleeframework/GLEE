Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price gives you a good margin. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  $900,000 is higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below my minimum:** It's lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **It's a strong opening:** It signals that I'm serious about selling, but I'm not giving it away cheaply. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is a good offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm going to try and push for a higher price, but I also need to be careful not to lose Bob entirely.  Let's see if I can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and I understand you're trying to get a good deal. However, I'm still not quite at that price point.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit while giving you a good price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

This counteroffer is designed to:

* **Show flexibility:** I'm not completely inflexible, and I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Meet in the middle:** $875,000 is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **Maintain some profit margin:**  It's still above my minimum acceptable price.

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle."
