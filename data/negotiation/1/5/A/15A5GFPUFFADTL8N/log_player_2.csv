Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1400000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Alice's counteroffer is still above your budget, but it's getting closer. It's worth trying to negotiate further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $1000000 is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and I'm not sure I'm comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $1250000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value and potential returns. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's counteroffer is still above your budget. While you're getting closer to a deal, it's not worth risking going another round and potentially losing the product to another buyer.  It's best to buy the product from John for $800,000."
