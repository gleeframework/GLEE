Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This leaves some room for negotiation but still allows me to make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is a good profit, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $13,500.  This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway. I'm hoping this will be a good enough deal for him, but still allows me to make a decent profit."
