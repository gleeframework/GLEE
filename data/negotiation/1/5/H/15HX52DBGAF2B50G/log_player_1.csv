Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe will be a great asset for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. It's a significant discount from its true value, so I hope you'll consider it. "", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I appreciate the product you're offering. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $15,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a significant discount. If you're serious about getting this product, I suggest you consider this final offer."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous one, it's still not close to my minimum desired price. I have five rounds left, and I'm willing to keep trying to negotiate a better deal. Selling to John for $15,000 is always an option, but I want to maximize my profit if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,500 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, and offer the product for $10,750. This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've considered your latest offer carefully. I am willing to pay $10,600 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,600 is still below my minimum desired price of $15,000, I've only got four rounds left.  If I keep rejecting, I risk Bob walking away and I'm left with the option to sell to John for $15,000.  It's better to secure a sale now at $10,600 than potentially get nothing in the following rounds."
