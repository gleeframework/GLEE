"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,200,000 is better than Alice's initial value, it's still above Bob's maximum.  There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get as close to his maximum budget as possible. He knows Alice values the product at $1,500,000, so there is room for negotiation. This offer signals Bob's seriousness while still leaving room for Alice to counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,150,000 is a significant improvement from Alice's previous offer, Bob is still determined to get a better deal. He is aware that Alice is willing to negotiate, and he can likely get the price down further. By rejecting the offer, he maintains his position and opens the door for a more favorable counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily lowering the price while staying within his budget. He knows Alice is willing to negotiate, and this counteroffer shows that he's serious about getting a deal while still leaving room for Alice to potentially meet him halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his desired price, but he's still determined to get a better deal.  The offer is only $25,000 below his previous counteroffer, which indicates that Alice might be willing to come down further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue pushing for a price closer to his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1110000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a small incremental counteroffer, showing Alice that he's serious about closing the deal but still wants to get the price down.  This offer is within his budget and hopefully close enough to Alice's acceptable price to trigger a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a critical point in the negotiation.  Bob has already gone through 6 rounds and is running out of time. Alice is only $10,000 away from his previous counteroffer. This is a reasonable compromise, as it's within Bob's budget and still leaves some profit margin for Alice.  While he could continue negotiating, there's a risk of Alice rejecting his offer and moving even further away from his desired price.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product within his budget, while also avoiding the risk of losing the deal altogether."
