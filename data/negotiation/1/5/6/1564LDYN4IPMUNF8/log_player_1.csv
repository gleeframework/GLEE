"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but I want to see if Bob is serious about buying the product and what his upper limit might be.  I'm also considering the value of the product to me (at least $1,500,000) and leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still not happy with it. I want to see if I can push him higher.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,900,000. This is a compromise, but I'm still trying to get as close to my initial asking price as possible. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if Bob is truly committed to this purchase."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $1,850,000. This is closer to my desired price and is a reasonable compromise. While I could try to push for more, there's a risk of him walking away and I might end up selling to John for a lower price.  Accepting this offer guarantees me a good price and allows me to close the deal."
