"Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Even though Alice's offer is more than what the product is worth to her ($120), it's still lower than the price John is selling for ($150). 
* **Saving money is the goal:** You want to buy the product but spend the least amount possible.  Accepting Alice's offer saves you $15 compared to buying from John."
