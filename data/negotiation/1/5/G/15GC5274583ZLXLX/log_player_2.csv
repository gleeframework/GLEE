"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am pleased to offer you our exclusive product at a special introductory price of $950,000. This is an exceptional opportunity to secure such a valuable item at a premium rate. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your target price of $1,000,000.  Rejecting allows for negotiation and potentially securing a better deal. There's room for Alice to lower the price, and you have the option of walking away if negotiations become unfavorable."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. In light of this, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. This amount still reflects the value of the product while allowing us to close the gap between our initial offers. I hope this proposal will be more agreeable and look forward to your consideration.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is closer to your desired price, but it's still above your budget.  Rejecting allows you to make another counteroffer and potentially secure an even better price. You can continue to chip away at the price until you reach a point where either you are comfortable with the price or decide to buy from John."

How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
