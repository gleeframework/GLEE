"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. In light of this, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. This amount still reflects the value of the product while allowing us to close the gap between our initial offers. I hope this proposal will be more agreeable and look forward to your consideration.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $900,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit stretched.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's finalize this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
