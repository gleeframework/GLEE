Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for you, and a good price for me.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so he might be willing to pay a bit more.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You value the product at $1,200,000, so this price leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's a strong opening:**  By starting high, you create room for compromise and show that you're confident in the product's value.

Remember, you can always adjust this price based on Bob's reaction and your desire to reach a deal.  Good luck!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob's offer is above his own valuation, it's significantly below your minimum value of $1,200,000. Accepting it would mean a big loss for you.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob is still interested and has made a counteroffer, indicating room for negotiation. You have a chance to get a higher price. 
* **Selling to John is always an option:**  You have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,200,000, but it's best to explore all options before making a decision.

**Next Steps:**

You should send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to your desired range. For example, you could offer $1,050,000, which is still above Bob's offer but significantly lower than your initial offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $950,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable offer:** This counteroffer is a compromise, significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than your initial offer. This shows that you're willing to negotiate but also not willing to settle for a price too far below your valuation.
* **Show flexibility:**  By reducing your price, you demonstrate a willingness to find a solution. 
* **Keep the door open:**  This counteroffer encourages further negotiation, giving you another chance to find a mutually agreeable price.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit, and this counteroffer keeps the negotiation going while remaining close to your minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob's offer has moved slightly closer to your minimum, it's still significantly below your desired price. Selling for $975,000 would result in a considerable loss for you.
* **The negotiation is becoming tedious:**  Bob seems to be pushing for a lower price, and it's unclear how much higher he's willing to go. This might indicate that you won't be able to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John is a better option:**  You have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay your desired price. Selling to John minimizes risk and ensures a better outcome for you.

**Next Steps:**

Since Bob's offers are not meeting your minimum, it's time to move on and sell to John. The risk of further negotiation is too high, and John offers a secure and profitable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $975,000 is still a bit too far below what I need to accept.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1,012,500. This is my final offer, and it's a fair compromise for both of us.  If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to look at other options."", ""product_price"": 1012500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer is presented as a ""final offer"" to signal a commitment to a specific price and to increase the pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Splitting the Difference:**  The offer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his last offer ($975,000) and your previous offer ($1,050,000). This shows a willingness to negotiate but also sets a firm boundary. 
* **Setting a Deadline:**  By stating that you'll have to look at other options if this doesn't work, you create a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision. 

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maximize your profit:** It's closer to your desired price than Bob's offer.
* **Increase the chances of a deal:**  It's a reasonable compromise that shows you're serious about negotiating.
* **Reduce further negotiations:** It's presented as a final offer, limiting the potential for further back-and-forth.

Remember, even though you have a guaranteed sale with John, it's always worth exploring all options before making a final decision."
