Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **Higher than Bob's value:**  Offering a price higher than what Bob thinks it's worth gives him room to negotiate.
* **Not too high:** It's not so high that Bob will immediately reject the offer. 
* **Friendly tone:** Setting a friendly tone can make Bob more receptive to negotiation. 

Remember, we can adjust this offer later based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, that's a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $85? I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is a bit tight. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than what I consider the product to be worth. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! $85 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really trying to stay within my budget. How about $90?  I think that's fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $100, Bob's offer of $90 is a good compromise.  It's still a better deal than selling to John, and it shows that Bob is willing to negotiate."
