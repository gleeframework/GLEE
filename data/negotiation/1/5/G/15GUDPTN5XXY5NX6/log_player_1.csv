Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm looking for a buyer who recognizes its value.  I'm willing to part with it for $18,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially gain more. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial high price will give you valuable information about his level of interest and flexibility.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John, so there's less risk in aiming high with Bob.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have a way to communicate your offer to Bob and receive his response without him being aware of John's guaranteed offer."
