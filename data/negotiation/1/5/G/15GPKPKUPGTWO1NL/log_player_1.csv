{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,800,000.  I believe this reflects a fair starting point for negotiations."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm not quite ready to commit to that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 
While $1,400,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably less than my initial ask. I believe there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I believe your offer undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,650,000. This price reflects both its inherent value and the unique benefits it offers you."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,550,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is consistently meeting me halfway, which indicates he's motivated to buy. I'll hold firm for now and see if I can push the price a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. To show my willingness to find a mutually agreeable solution, I'll adjust my price to $1,600,000. I believe this offer fairly reflects the value of the product and our negotiation thus far."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price, but I'm still not comfortable with the offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,500,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While I believe the product is worth more, Bob is consistently moving towards my price point, albeit slowly. Accepting his offer of $1,500,000 provides a substantial profit and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds."
