Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be worth more than that to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:**  The message is positive, highlighting the deal's potential value for Bob. This encourages him to consider the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The offer is not my absolute minimum, leaving space for Bob to counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Backup Option:** Knowing I have a buyer (John) willing to pay $15,000 gives me a strong fallback position if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. This is my final offer, as I have another option for the same product at a similar price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob's offer is a step closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my target price. 
* **Selling to John is the best option:** Given that John is willing to pay $15,000,  it doesn't make sense to accept Bob's offer and lose out on a much better deal.
* **Counteroffer is unnecessary:**  Bob's offer is final and I have a better option with John. There's no point in wasting time and potentially risking a lower price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have another option, but I'm not willing to go that low.  $10,000 is my final offer.  It's still a great price for the product, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you.  If this isn't acceptable, I will have to move forward with my other buyer."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** While I'm not accepting Bob's offer, I'm showing willingness to compromise by lowering my price. 
* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer is still above Bob's perceived value but lower than my original asking price. 
* **Setting a Deadline:**  I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer to create urgency and encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Reminding Bob of the Value:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob reinforces the potential for him to make a profit. 
* **Reiterating John's Offer:**  Subtly mentioning John's offer serves as a reminder that I have alternative options, further emphasizing my decision to sell to John if Bob doesn't accept."
