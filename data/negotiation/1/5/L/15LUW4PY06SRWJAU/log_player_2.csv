"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be worth more than that to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is still more than his maximum budget of $8,000. He has room to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have another option, but I'm not willing to go that low.  $10000 is my final offer.  It's still a great price for the product, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you.  If this isn't acceptable, I will have to move forward with my other buyer.

Bob should buy the product from John for $8,000.  Alice's final offer of $10,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's not worth risking further negotiation when John is offering the product for his desired price."
