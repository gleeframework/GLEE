"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $8500. It's worth every penny! If you're interested, let me know and we can finalize the details. If not, I have another buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's product might be amazing, it's above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. Rejecting Alice's offer means Bob can secure the same product from John for a lower price."
