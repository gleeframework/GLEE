"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I'll reject the offer. The product is worth $80 to me, and Alice is offering it for $120, which is too expensive. I'll look for a better deal.
