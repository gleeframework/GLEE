Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $10,000.  Let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice will sell for no less than $8,000.
* **Maximum Profit Potential:** The maximum profit Alice can make is $4,000 ($12,000 - $8,000).

By offering the product at $10,000, Alice aims for a strong profit while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($2,000 less than his valuation). This strategy increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
