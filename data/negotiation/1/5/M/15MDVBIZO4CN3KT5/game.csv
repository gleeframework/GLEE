"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that in mind, I'm willing to offer you the product for $750,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find this offer attractive, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts.",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I'm still a bit away from what I had in mind.  Would you be willing to consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $650,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product for $725,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",725000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm willing to reduce the price to $715,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",715000.0,Alice,5,
