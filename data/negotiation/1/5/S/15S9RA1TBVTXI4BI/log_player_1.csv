Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to your product's value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** While you know Bob values the product at $12,000, starting with a high offer tests his willingness to pay a premium.
* **John as Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, so there's little risk in starting high with Bob.

**Why this approach is strategic:**

* **Anchoring:** This high initial offer sets an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind. Even if he doesn't accept this price, it might make him more receptive to a slightly lower counteroffer (still well above $12,000).
* **Negotiation Room:** The offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob wants to haggle, but ensures you're still making a substantial profit."
