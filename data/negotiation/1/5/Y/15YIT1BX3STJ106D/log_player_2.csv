"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for a lower price than $1,200,000.  You should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You have room to negotiate as you're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, and Alice is willing to sell for as low as $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000, but still higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation and hopefully will encourage Alice to accept, while still allowing me to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,150,000 is still within my budget and a good deal considering I'm willing to pay up to $1,500,000 from John. Accepting this offer saves me $350,000 compared to buying from John. There's always a risk of further negotiation, but the potential savings are not significant enough to justify the risk of losing the deal."
