"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After considering your potential interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  This is still a good deal for you, as it's significantly higher than what you value the product at. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to pay a bit less, but I'm still willing to compromise. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll counter with a price of $1,150,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to both of us. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
