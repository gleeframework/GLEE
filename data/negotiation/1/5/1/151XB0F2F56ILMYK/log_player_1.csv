Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is significantly below its true worth. I could consider letting it go for $925,000. This is a compromise, reflecting its value while acknowledging your interest."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $925,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, Bob arriving at my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) is a good outcome. It's better to secure the deal now than risk him lowering his offer in subsequent rounds."
