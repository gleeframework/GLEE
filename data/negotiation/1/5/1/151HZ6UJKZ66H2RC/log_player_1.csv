Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  By starting high, I create space for Bob to counteroffer without me feeling pressured to immediately accept a low price.
* **Emphasizing value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to motivate him to consider my offer.
* **Open to negotiation:**  My message makes it clear that I'm open to discussion, fostering a more collaborative tone. 
* **Plan B:**  I have John as a backup buyer, providing me with a safety net in case negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While it's closer to my desired price, $900,000 is still below my minimum of $1,200,000.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  I believe I can push for a higher price by counteroffering. Bob is clearly interested in the product, and I can leverage that interest to my advantage.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to control the negotiation and potentially secure a better outcome.
* **John as a safety net:**  I can always sell to John for $1,200,000 if negotiations with Bob break down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $950,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer with a reasonable decrease:**  I'm dropping my price from $1,000,000 to $950,000, showing a willingness to compromise. This is a significant enough drop to show flexibility without immediately caving to Bob's initial offer.
* **Highlighting value:** I reiterate the product's value to Bob, emphasizing the fairness of the price I'm proposing.
* **Open to discussion:**  My message maintains an open and friendly tone, encouraging continued negotiations.
* **Strategic pricing:**  $950,000 is still significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000), but it's lower than my initial offer and gives Bob a sense of progress. This strategy aims to maximize my profit while potentially securing a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your willingness to come down, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $920,000 is only slightly below my minimum desired price of $1,200,000.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I continue to reject offers, I risk losing Bob as a buyer entirely.
* **John as a safety net:** I still have John as a backup buyer, so even if I accept Bob's offer, I won't be significantly disadvantaged.
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag out the process, and I might not be able to secure a significantly higher price. 

It's important to weigh the potential benefits of continuing to negotiate against the risk of losing Bob as a buyer and the time commitment involved.  In this scenario, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most pragmatic choice."
