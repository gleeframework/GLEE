Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer to Alice. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to her, I'll try to get a price closer to that. However, I'm willing to pay up to $1,200,000, so I'll make an offer in between.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $1100000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $1300000? This would still allow me to recoup a significant portion of the value of the product while providing you with a substantial savings. Let's try to find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to get closer to my target price by making another counteroffer. Since Alice's initial offer was $1,400,000 and her last offer was $1,300,000, I'll try to meet her halfway.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
