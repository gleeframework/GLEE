"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a one-time price of $10,500. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her product valuation, it's still significantly higher than your maximum price and what John offers. Rejecting her offer opens the door for a better deal, either from Alice in a counter-offer or by purchasing from John at your target price."
