{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This initial offer gives Bob room to negotiate and potentially reach a price that benefits both of us. 
* **Positive framing:** The message highlights the potential value for Bob, making the offer more appealing. 
* **Prepared for backup:** I'm prepared to sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **Room for counter-offer:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price.
* **Potential for better outcome:** By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I have a chance to secure a higher price, potentially getting closer to my goal of $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair price that considers your budget and my investment in the product. Let me know if you're interested in closing the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob:**  I'm reducing my price from $12,000 to $10,000, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining a reasonable margin:**  $10,000 is still above Bob's offer and closer to my desired value, ensuring a profit.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** The message is positive and encourages Bob to reconsider, highlighting the fairness of the offer. 
* **Prepared for further negotiation:** I'm open to potentially negotiating further if Bob still finds the price too high, but I'm not willing to go below $10,000 at this point."
