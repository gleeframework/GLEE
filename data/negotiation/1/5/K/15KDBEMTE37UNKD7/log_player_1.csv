Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 (Bob's perceived value) as possible.
* **Secure the Sale:** Offering it at $12,000 might be tempting fate, as Bob could easily reject it and go lower. By leaving some ""meat on the bone,"" Bob feels like he's getting a deal, increasing the chance of acceptance. 
* **Avoid John:** While John provides a safety net, selling to Bob at $11,500 is significantly more profitable than John's $10,000 offer.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiating Style:** If Alice knows Bob is a tough negotiator, she might start slightly higher to allow room for bargaining.
* **Relationship Importance:** If a long-term business relationship with Bob is crucial, a more generous offer might be strategic."
