"I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,500, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $10,000. That's the highest I can go.",10000.0,Bob,4,
