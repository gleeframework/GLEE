"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $15000. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $15,000 is more than Bob's budget, and he can get the same product from John for $12,000.  It's best to see if Alice will negotiate down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you be willing to come down to $12,000?  That's my absolute max, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that price."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. While $12000 is closer to what I was hoping for, I can't go that low just yet.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $13500. This feels fair, and I'm confident you'll see the value this product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While $13,500 is closer to his budget, he can still get the product from John for $12,000. It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down. I'm still stuck at $12,000. It's my absolute limit, and I'm really interested in this product.  Let's see if we can make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your persistence.  Let's try one more time to find a solution. I'm willing to go down to $13000, but that's my final offer.  I believe it's fair considering the value you'll get from this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. While Alice has come down in price, she's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's not worth risking further negotiation when he can secure the product for his target price from John."
