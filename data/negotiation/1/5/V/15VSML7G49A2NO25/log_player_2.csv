"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is under your maximum budget, you know John will sell you the same product for $1,200,000.  It makes the most financial sense to buy from John and save the extra $100,000."
