Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $115."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $120 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:** You have a backup offer of $100 from John.

By offering the product at $115, you are:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  You're aiming for the highest price Bob might reasonably accept. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While unlikely, Bob could counter-offer.
* **Above Your Minimum:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, you're covered by John's $100 offer."
