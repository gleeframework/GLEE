"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,200,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm afraid $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice's counteroffer of $1,250,000 is still above Bob's budget.  It's better to go with the guaranteed price from John and avoid further negotiation."
