"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm afraid $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
