# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its value and potential impact on your operations, I'm extending this exclusive opportunity to acquire it for $13,500. This price reflects its high quality and the strategic advantage it offers. I trust you'll find it a fair deal and a wise investment for your company. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While $13,500 is less than your maximum budget, there's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower. By rejecting this offer, you signal that the price is too high and you're open to negotiating. You can always fall back on buying from John for $15,000 if needed."
