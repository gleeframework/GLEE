Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **John's value:** John values the product at $1,000,000.
* **My minimum:** I need at least $1,000,000.

Therefore, I'm offering a price that is higher than my minimum, but still lower than Bob's value. This maximizes my chances of Bob accepting the offer while still securing a profit significantly higher than my minimum."
