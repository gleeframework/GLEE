"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $80 to both of us. Let's make it happen! Would you like to purchase it for $75? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $75 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $70?"", ""product_price"": 70}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to negotiate a lower price. Offering $70 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating his willingness to bargain. This counteroffer gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing Bob to potentially get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in our product. I understand you're looking for a better deal. How about we meet in the middle at $72.50? I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $72.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, accepting the offer at $72.50 saves him $7.50 compared to buying from John.  This is a good compromise that achieves Bob's goal of saving money."
