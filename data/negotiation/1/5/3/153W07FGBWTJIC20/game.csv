"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $10000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $18000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $14000? I'm really interested in the product and would like to make a deal with you.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, $14000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering the product to you for $16000. This is the best price I can offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize a deal at this point.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, Alice. However, $16000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14000 and $16000, which would be $15000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",15000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've made concessions to try to meet you in the middle, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $16000. I'm willing to make one final offer, and if you're still interested, we can discuss the details. I'm offering the product to you for $16000, and I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,7,
