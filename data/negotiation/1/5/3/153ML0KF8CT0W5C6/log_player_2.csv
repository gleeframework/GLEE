"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a good deal, it's still above your maximum budget of $100.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $95 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $90? It's still a great price for a product worth $100 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price. While $90 is still more than you'd like, it's a better deal than buying from John for $100. Accepting the offer secures the product within your budget."
