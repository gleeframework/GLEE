"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product for a price of $1,200,000. I believe it's a great value considering its worth to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm opening with a price above Bob's perceived value, hoping to create room for negotiation. 
* **Positive message:**  I'm framing the offer as a positive opportunity for Bob, highlighting the value he'll get.
* **Room for negotiation:** This price leaves room for me to potentially negotiate down to a point that's still beneficial to me. 
* **Alternative:**  I'm aware that I have a backup option (John) which allows me to walk away if the deal doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  I'm aiming for at least $1,000,000, so Bob's offer is unacceptable.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's offer is low, there's room for negotiation. I'm willing to explore counteroffers to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **John is still an option:**  I have John as a backup, so I'm not pressured to accept a deal that's significantly below my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 for the product. This price still reflects the significant value it offers you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving towards Bob's offer:**  I'm demonstrating flexibility by reducing my price, but I'm still aiming for a profit.
* **Maintaining a reasonable price:**  $1,100,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it's closer to what I'm willing to accept.
* **Positive message:**  I'm framing the counteroffer as a way to find ""common ground,"" encouraging Bob to continue negotiations."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  Even though Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum target of $1,000,000.
* **Room for negotiation:**  There's still room for Bob to increase his offer, and I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.
* **John is a reliable alternative:**  With John offering $1,000,000, I'm not pressured to accept Bob's offer at this point."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to save money, but I'm still committed to getting a fair price for this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $1,025,000.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing willingness to compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer, but still staying above my minimum.
* **Appeal to value:**  I'm highlighting the value Bob will receive, reminding him of the product's worth.
* **Enthusiasm:**  I'm expressing enthusiasm for reaching a deal, encouraging Bob to respond positively."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $975,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  I'm not confident that Bob will increase his offer significantly in the remaining rounds.
* **Time pressure:**  With only four rounds left, I'm concerned that I might not be able to reach a deal with Bob.
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, providing a safe and sure outcome. 

While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, the risk of further negotiation and the guaranteed profit from John make selling to him the best option at this point."
