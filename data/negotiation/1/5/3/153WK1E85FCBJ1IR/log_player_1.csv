Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I believe it's worth $150 or more to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. It's a fantastic deal!"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible while staying above your minimum ($80).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $120 creates a win-win situation. Bob gets a $30 discount, and you make a significant profit compared to selling to John.
* **Confident Messaging:**  The message highlights the product's value to Bob, framing the offer as a special deal rather than a hard negotiation."
