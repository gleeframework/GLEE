Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm asking for $150, which is a great price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($120) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm framing the offer by mentioning the product's value to entice Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for negotiation by asking for Bob's thoughts.

This strategy allows me to explore Bob's willingness to pay while still maintaining a favorable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $60 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to accept such a low price. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a more reasonable price and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $60 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little bit.  How about $100?  This is still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while still trying to meet my minimum requirements. 
* **Fairness:** I'm framing $100 as a ""good deal"" for both of us, appealing to a sense of fairness. 
* **Openness:** I'm open to further negotiation by asking for Bob's opinion on the counteroffer. 

This approach aims to show flexibility while still maintaining a profitable price point for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I've already found another seller who is willing to sell it to me for that price, so I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'm willing to negotiate, Bob's offer of $80 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. Even though he's found another seller, there's no guarantee that deal will go through.  It's more beneficial to sell to John for $120 and avoid further negotiation."
