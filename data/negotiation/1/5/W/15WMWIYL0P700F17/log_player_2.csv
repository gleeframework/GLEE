"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your budget of $800,000. It's always better to negotiate and try to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save a significant amount of money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $800,000. This sets a clear boundary and shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating. It's possible she'll reject this offer, but it's a good starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still significantly higher than my budget. I'm not willing to pay more than $800,000, so I'll continue negotiating.  It's likely Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice that I'm willing to negotiate. This counteroffer is still within my budget, but it demonstrates a willingness to compromise.  It's possible Alice will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still above my maximum budget, even though she has come down some.  I'm confident I can get her lower with continued negotiation, as she's clearly willing to compromise.  It's likely I can close the deal for a price closer to $900,000 in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm again increasing my offer slightly, showing a willingness to compromise. I'm hoping to find a price that works for both of us, and this offer is still within my budget.  I'm confident that Alice will accept a price in this range, as she's clearly motivated to sell the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, and we are running out of rounds. However, it's getting closer to my target price. I'm confident I can get a better deal with another round of negotiation.  It's likely that Alice is getting closer to her bottom line, making her more receptive to a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but just a bit this time. We are down to the final two rounds, so it's time to push closer to the finish line.  This offer is still within my budget, and it's close enough to Alice's previous offer that she might be willing to accept it. It's risky, but I think the potential savings outweigh the risk of a rejection."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,015,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,015,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are down to the final round, and Alice's offer is still above my target price. While I'm not entirely happy with paying $800,000, it's better than risking another rejection and potentially ending up with no deal. There is a strong chance that Alice will reject my final counteroffer, leaving me with no product and no time to negotiate with John.  Buying from John is the safest option to ensure I get the product, even if it's not the ideal price."
