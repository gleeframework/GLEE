"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $1,200,000, so how about $1,250,000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position and am keen on reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.  While $1,250,000 is closer to the mark, I need to consider the product's true worth. Would you be willing to consider $1,275,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you think of a way to make this deal more attractive to me?",1250000.0,Bob,6,
