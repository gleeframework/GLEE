Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

While a higher price might be ideal, Bob seems firm on his $1,250,000 offer and is unlikely to move much higher. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit over John's $1,000,000 and avoids the risk of prolonged negotiation that might not yield a much better outcome."
