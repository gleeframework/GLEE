"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price close to what I know the product is worth to Bob, but leaving some room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This price allows for a few rounds of back-and-forth before I have to consider John's offer. 
* **Avoiding a quick rejection:**  If I start too low, Bob might immediately counter with an offer closer to his $8,000 floor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for improvement:** $8,500 is still lower than what I'm hoping for, and I haven't exhausted all negotiation rounds yet.
* **Holding out for a better deal:** I can likely get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the pressure on him and reminds him of the value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  
* **Meeting halfway:** It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value. 
* **Still above John's offer:** This price is still higher than John's offer, making it more appealing for me than selling to him right now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation is ongoing:** We're still early in the negotiation process, and I'm confident that I can get a better price.
* **Small increment:**  While Bob's offer is slightly higher, it's not a significant enough increase to warrant accepting it at this point. 
* **Keeping the pressure on:** By rejecting this offer, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate to sell and that I'm willing to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8900} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reducing the gap:** I'm lowering my offer slightly to acknowledge Bob's incremental increase. 
* **Testing the waters:**  This offer is a bit of a test to see if Bob is serious about closing the deal.
* **Still above John's offer:** I'm staying above John's price point, making this option more appealing to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited rounds:** We are getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Minimal gain:** Bob's offer is only $100 higher than my previous counteroffer, which is a small increase.
* **Secure a sale:**  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of a lower offer or having to sell to John for less."
