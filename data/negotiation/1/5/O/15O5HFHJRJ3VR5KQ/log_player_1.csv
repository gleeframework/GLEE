"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a reason for the price, highlighting its value to Bob. 
* **Openness to negotiation:** My message shows I'm willing to negotiate and I'm interested in Bob's thoughts. 

This strategy balances my desire to get a good price with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $140 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $130.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still above my minimum:**  While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still higher than what I would get from John. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob. 
* **Limited rounds:** I don't want to risk losing the opportunity for a better price by settling too early. 

I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, $130 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is still a great price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to sway him towards a higher price.
* **Positive language:** I'm using positive language to encourage a deal, even though I'm rejecting his offer."
