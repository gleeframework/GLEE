"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a better price than John's $150, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore a lower price, potentially saving even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $140 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $130.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway while still saving money. Offering $130 is a reasonable counteroffer, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate without being too aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, $130 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is still a great price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $135, which is a good price for Bob considering his maximum budget is $150.  Accepting the offer saves Bob $15 compared to buying from John, and it's only $5 more than Bob's initial counteroffer."
