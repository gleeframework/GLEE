Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll be able to gauge Bob's interest based on his response and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $130 is closer to my minimum, but I believe I can still get a better price. I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm going to counter with $140. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. Hopefully, Bob will see that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $135 is a good compromise. It's higher than my minimum and only slightly lower than my last counteroffer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial price, continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a profit."
