"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present our premium product to you. This exceptional item holds a significant value of $15,000 to you, and we understand its importance. To ensure a fair transaction, I propose to sell it to you for $12,000. This offer reflects a strategic balance between maximizing my earnings and providing you with an opportunity to acquire something of great worth. Please let me know if this proposal meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly inflating the product's value to you. 
* While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget and buying from John, it's still significantly more than Alice values the product.
* By rejecting this offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice or get a better deal elsewhere."
