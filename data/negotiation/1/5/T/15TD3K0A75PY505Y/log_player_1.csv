{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking $20,000 for it, but I'm open to reasonable offers. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$20,000 is a starting point.** It's above my minimum value of $15,000, giving me room to negotiate. 
* **""Reasonable offers""**  keeps the door open for negotiation and encourages Bob to counter-offer.
* **Direct communication** allows for potential relationship building, which could lead to a more favorable deal. 
* **This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially learn more about his perceived value of the product.**"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum value, I'm not in a rush to sell and would like to see if I can get a bit more. Rejecting his offer allows me to:

* **See if Bob will counter-offer again.**  He might be willing to go slightly higher. 
* **Demonstrate that I am serious about getting a better price.** This could potentially increase his willingness to negotiate.
* **Keep my options open.** If negotiations stall, I can always sell to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. I'm willing to come down to $17,500 for the product. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I've lowered my price, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Fair compromise:** $17,500 is a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's, demonstrating a desire for a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Emphasize value:**  Reminding Bob of the significant reduction in price encourages him to see the value in my counteroffer.
* **Open communication:**  The message invites Bob to respond and keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $17500, but I'm still a bit above that. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $17000. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Value:** Bob's offer of $17,000 is higher than my minimum value of $15,000 and only $500 less than my previous counteroffer. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  While I could try for a higher price, it's possible that Bob won't budge further.  
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort. 
* **Opportunity cost:**  Holding out for a slightly higher price risks losing the sale to Bob or having to sell to John for a lower price. 

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most reasonable choice in this situation."
