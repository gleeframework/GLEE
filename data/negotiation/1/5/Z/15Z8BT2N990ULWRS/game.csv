"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $700,000.

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'll make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $650,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price. What do you think?",650000.0,Alice,5,
