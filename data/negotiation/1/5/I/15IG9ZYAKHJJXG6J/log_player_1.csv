Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $100. I know it's valuable to you and I think this is a fair price."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you insight into how badly he wants the product and how much he might be willing to pay.  
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, so there's no risk of losing money if Bob rejects the offer."
