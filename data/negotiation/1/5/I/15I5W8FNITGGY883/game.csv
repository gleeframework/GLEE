"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $850000. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of $875000. What are your thoughts?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825000. Can we discuss further?",825000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of $850000 is too low for me, but $825000 is too low as well. Let's try to find a sweet spot. I'm willing to meet you at $860000. What are your thoughts?",860000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $840000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What are your thoughts?",840000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the minimum value I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one final concession. I can meet you at $820000, but that's as low as I can go. If we can't agree on this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",820000.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm at my maximum budget. I'm willing to meet you at $800000. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to explore other options, including buying from John for $1000000.",800000.0,Bob,10,
