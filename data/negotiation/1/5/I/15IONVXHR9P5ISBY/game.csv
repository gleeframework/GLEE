"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, your starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer. However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your proposed price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but $1,750,000 is still too high for me. I can offer $1,250,000.  This offer represents a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything below $1,600,000.  This is my final offer, as I have other interested parties.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
