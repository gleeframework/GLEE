"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, I really appreciate the offer, but $130 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $90? I think that would be fair for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's a fair price that leaves us both satisfied.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $100.  That's a good deal for both of us, and we can finalize the sale.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but $100 just isn't quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a good compromise that allows us both to get what we want. Let's finalize this deal at $105!",105.0,Alice,5,
