"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I believe it's a bit steep at $800000, and I'd like to try to meet in the middle.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $700000. I'm willing to pay $650000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me.",650000.0,Bob,4,
