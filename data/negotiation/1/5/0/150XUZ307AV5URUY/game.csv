"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $110?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is a great deal for you and still allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $130, but I'm still a little over my budget.  Would you consider $125? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",125.0,Bob,4,
