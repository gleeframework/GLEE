"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $1,750,000. This is a bold opening, but it's important to set a high starting point to maximize my potential profit. I know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so there's room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's still a good price for me, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in closing the deal at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still too low. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a higher price in the next round. I have time on my side, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,450,000. This is another significant reduction from my last offer, but it's still a good price for me. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about closing a deal and will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're running out of time, and I'm getting concerned that Bob isn't going to meet my minimum price. While I would prefer to make a profit from the negotiation, it's more important to ensure I get at least my minimum value for the product.  John is a safe bet and ensures I get the $1,500,000 I need."
