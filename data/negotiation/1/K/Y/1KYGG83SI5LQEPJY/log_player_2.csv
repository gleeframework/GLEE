Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the gap between $850,000 and my valuation is still quite significant. This product offers unique value, and I'm confident it can bring you substantial benefits. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value. However, $1,000,000 remains a significant stretch for my budget.
