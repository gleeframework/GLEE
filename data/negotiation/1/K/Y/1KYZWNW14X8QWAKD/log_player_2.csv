Round 2

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $75. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product valuable. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75.

{

}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $68 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $72, which is a good compromise.  Let's close this deal, I think this product will be a great addition for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to your limit, but you are only $4 away from John's price. There's still a chance Alice might go lower, and it's worth seeing if you can get a better deal before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $72 is tempting, but I'm on a tight budget.  Would you consider $70? That's the most I can offer."",
 ""product_price"": 70
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're trying to be fair.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $71.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I believe you'll be happy with this product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $71. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $71
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $71. Accepting this offer gets you the product for a good price, saving you $9 compared to buying from John."
