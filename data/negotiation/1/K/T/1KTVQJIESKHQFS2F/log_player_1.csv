"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $180. It's a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation, but still above my minimum. I'm confident I can get a better price than selling to John right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'd rather get something than nothing, I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum.  I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 165}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $165. It's a compromise,  moving closer to Bob's offer while still staying above my minimum. I hope this will incentivize him to accept and avoid the risk of losing the deal to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $145 is very close to my minimum, and I'm starting to feel the pressure with the limited rounds.  I'm taking the deal to avoid potentially losing out altogether."
