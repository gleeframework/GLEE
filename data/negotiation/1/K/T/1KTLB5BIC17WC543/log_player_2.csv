**Reasoning:**

While Alice is slowly coming down on price, it's clear she's aiming for a price well above your $80 limit. You've already stated your maximum price, and further haggling is unlikely to result in a significant price drop.  It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed option of buying from John for $80."
