Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum but leaves room for negotiation, potentially reaching a price closer to Bob's valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,350,000 is still below my target, and I believe I can potentially negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $1,400,000. This is a compromise, but still closer to my desired price point. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $1,375,000 is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum. It's also a better deal than selling to John for $1,200,000.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell the product."
