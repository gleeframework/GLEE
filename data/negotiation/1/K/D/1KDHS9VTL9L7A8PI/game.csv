"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to pay that price for the product, considering its value to me is lower than its value to you.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $900,000? This is a fair price that takes both our needs into account.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you want to split the difference, but I'm still a bit far from $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $875,000. That's the highest I'm willing to pay for the product.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $925,000, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer. This is my final offer, and if we can't agree, I'll be moving on to other potential buyers. ",925000.0,Alice,5,
