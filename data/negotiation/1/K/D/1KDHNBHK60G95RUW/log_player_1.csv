"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This is a high starting point, but it leaves room for negotiation and still allows for a healthy profit for me. I believe this is a reasonable starting point given Bob's perceived value of $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $7,500 is too low.  While it's tempting to accept, I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm going to counter with $8,500. This is a significant increase from Bob's offer and still leaves room for negotiation.  I believe this price is fair, considering my minimum value of $8,000 and Bob's perceived value of $10,000.  Hopefully, Bob will be willing to compromise and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $7,000 is still too low.  I'm confident I can get a better price, even if it means a few more rounds of negotiation. I'm going to reject his offer and continue to try and find a compromise that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8200}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $8,200. This is a smaller step than before, showing that I'm willing to be flexible but not desperate. I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired $8,500. Hopefully, Bob will see that I'm serious about getting a deal done and will be willing to come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unreasonable. While there are still a few rounds left, it seems unlikely that he'll be willing to meet me halfway.  At this point, it's better to cut my losses and sell to John for $8,000. This ensures I get my minimum desired value and avoids potentially losing more money by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
