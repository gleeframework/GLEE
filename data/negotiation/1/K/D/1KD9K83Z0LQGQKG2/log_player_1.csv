This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price.  This creates room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,250. This would allow me to make a fair profit while still giving you a great deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After considering your latest offer, I would like to propose $11,000 as the price for the product. This would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Bob has remained firm at $11,000. While this is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation. I'm confident John will pay my minimum price, so I'll take the secure deal."
