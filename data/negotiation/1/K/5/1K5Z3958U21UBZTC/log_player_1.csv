Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is slightly lower than Bob's perceived value, potentially leaving room for negotiation while still securing a profit for you.  This approach balances the need for profit with the potential to secure a higher price through further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is still above your minimum, it's significantly lower than your initial offer and leaves less room for further negotiation.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your ideal outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $11,500? This would allow us to both benefit from the transaction. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice. However, I'm still a bit far from your initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,250? I think this is a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,250 is very close to your initial counteroffer of $11,500. It is above your minimum threshold of $10,000, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly higher price.  Accepting this offer ensures a profitable sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price or a failed deal."
