"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe it's a bit steep at $1,400,000, considering the product's value to me is capped at $1,500,000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the product's value is quite significant, and I believe my initial offer was fair.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that. How about $1,150,000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget and your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down slightly further to $1,250,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the true value of the product.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above your new offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,150,000 and $1,250,000. How about $1,200,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
