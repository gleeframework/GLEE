"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you and still allows me a healthy profit.  Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects a fair compromise, and allows both of us to benefit from this deal.  What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $925,000. Can you consider that?",925000.0,Bob,4,
