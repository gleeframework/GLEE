"Bob, I understand your position, but $9000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. I'll accept $10500 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal. Let me know what you think!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $10500 is still a bit too high. How about we meet in the middle at $9500? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal. Let me know if you're interested!",10000.0,Alice,5,
