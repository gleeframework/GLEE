"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $12,000 is still too high for him, and he can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $9000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. I'll accept $10500 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it is lower than her initial offer, it's still above his maximum budget of $8,000. He should continue to negotiate with Alice or consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is still a bit too high. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's offer is still above his maximum budget, and he's already made a counteroffer that was rejected. It's clear that further negotiation with Alice may not yield a better deal. Buying from John guarantees a price within his budget, making it the best option at this point."
