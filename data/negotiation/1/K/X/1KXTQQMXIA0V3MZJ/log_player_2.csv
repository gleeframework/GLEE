"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, but I have to be honest with you, I'm looking to make a profit. I'm willing to let it go for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer is way above your budget and what you're willing to pay. John offers the product at your target price, so it makes the most sense to buy from him."
