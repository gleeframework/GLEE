Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $10,500 is better than your previous offer, it's still a bit too low for me.

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  While Bob has gotten closer to my desired price, it's clear that we're not going to reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum threshold and eliminates further negotiation."
