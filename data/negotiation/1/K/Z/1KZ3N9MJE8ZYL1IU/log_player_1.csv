"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and emphasizing the mutual benefits of the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. How about we settle around $650,000? That feels like a fair starting point for negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,200,000. While it's tempting to accept and secure a sale quickly, I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating with him to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I have 10 rounds and want to see if I can make a deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $650,000 is lower than my initial offer. However, it's significantly below what I need to make this deal work for me. Let's split the difference and settle on $850,000. This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good outcome."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about $725,000?  That's a significant move on my part, and I'm hopeful we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, but he's showing a willingness to negotiate. I'm going to continue negotiating with him in hopes of reaching a mutually agreeable price. I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $725,000 is still too low for me.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to drop my price to $800,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's a significant compromise on my part. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
