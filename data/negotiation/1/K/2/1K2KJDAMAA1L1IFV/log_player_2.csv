{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,100,000.  I'm willing to go to $1,075,000.  It's a significant move from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can seal the deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Accepting the offer now ensures a deal with Alice, saving the risk of further negotiation and a potential loss of the product."
