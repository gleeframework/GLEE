"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is tailored to meet your specific needs. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth considering. My initial offer is $9,500 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, I believe the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a lower offer than what you're willing to pay. This gives you room to negotiate upwards.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By offering $7,000, we're anchoring the negotiation closer to our desired price range.  While it's lower than what Alice wants, it signals that we're serious buyers but also price-conscious. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This offer leaves space for Alice to counter, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter your offer with a price of $8,200 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your budget while still reflecting the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but still room:** Alice came down a significant amount from her initial offer, which is a good sign. However, $8,200 is still above our target price.
* **More rounds to negotiate:** We have plenty of rounds left to try and reach a more favorable agreement.
* **John as backup:**  We always have the option of going with John for $10,000 if the negotiations don't move in a positive direction."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,600? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 7600
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer splits the difference between our previous offer ($7,000) and Alice's current offer ($8,200). This strategy is often perceived as fair and can help move negotiations forward. 
* **Still Below Our Maximum:** We're still aiming for a price that's comfortably below our $10,000 maximum.
* **Maintaining Momentum:** We're showing Alice that we're serious about reaching a deal but also standing firm on our budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your proposal, Bob. I've considered your offer carefully, and I would like to counter with a price of $8,000 for the product. This reflects my assessment of its value and should allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **At Alice's Value:** Alice has come down to $8,000, which is her stated value for the product. It's unlikely she'll go any lower.
* **Significant Savings:** We're getting the product for $2,000 less than John's offer, which is a substantial saving.
* **Risk of Pushing Further:**  Trying to negotiate a lower price at this stage might make Alice walk away, forcing us to buy from John at a higher price."
