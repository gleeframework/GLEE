Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a higher initial price:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, I can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justifying the price:**  While the message doesn't explicitly reveal the product's worth to me, it hints at the product's value to encourage Bob to consider a price higher than his perceived value ($8,000).

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit. However, setting the price too high might make Bob immediately reject the offer without attempting to negotiate."
