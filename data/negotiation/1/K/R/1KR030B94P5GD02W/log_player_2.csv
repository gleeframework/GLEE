Round 2

Round 3

Alice is coming down, but I think I can still get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $101. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $101
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I could try to haggle further, Alice seems firm on her price and $101 is a reasonable deal. It's better to accept now and not risk losing the opportunity for a decent discount."
