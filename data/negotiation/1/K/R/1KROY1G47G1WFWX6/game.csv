"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, and I'm open to negotiating the price. Let's start with a price of $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18000 is out of my price range. I'm really interested in this product, but my maximum budget is $8000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you have a budget constraint, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. Let's meet in the middle at $12000. I think that's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $10000,  which is still a good deal for you considering what this product is worth. How about we split the difference and settle on $10000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $10000, which is $11000. I think that's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to be as fair as possible here, but $11000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm willing to go up to $9500.  This is a good deal for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal quickly. What do you say?",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to be fair, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11000 and $9500, which is $10250. I think that's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm really trying to make this work, but I'm still not comfortable going above $9500.  I'm happy to close the deal right now at that price. It's a good deal for both of us, and we can avoid going back and forth any further.",9500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to make one final offer of $10750. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value this product brings. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.",10750.0,Alice,9,
