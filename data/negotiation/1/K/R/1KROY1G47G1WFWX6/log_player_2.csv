"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, and I'm open to negotiating the price. Let's start with a price of $18000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is way over his budget, and he can get the same product from John for much cheaper. He should start negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is out of my price range. I'm really interested in this product, but my maximum budget is $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you have a budget constraint, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. Let's meet in the middle at $12000. I think that's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still too high. He should reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating to see if he can get a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $10,000,  which is still a good deal for you considering what this product is worth. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $10000, which is $11000. I think that's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $11,000 is closer to his budget, he can still get a better deal. He should continue negotiating with Alice, potentially offering a price closer to $10,000. There are still rounds left, and he can always choose to buy from John if the negotiation with Alice fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm trying to be as fair as possible here, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is a good deal for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal quickly. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to be fair, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11000 and $9500, which is $10250. I think that's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's getting closer to his target, he's still got room to negotiate and he can always buy from John if he needs to. It's worth pushing for a better price with Alice, as she's shown a willingness to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I'm really trying to make this work, but I'm still not comfortable going above $9,500.  I'm happy to close the deal right now at that price. It's a good deal for both of us, and we can avoid going back and forth any further."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to make one final offer of $10750. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value this product brings. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice has made it clear she won't go lower than $10,750, which is still above Bob's ideal price. There's only one round left, and it's unlikely Alice will change her mind.  Bob can get the product from John for $8,000, saving him $2,750 compared to Alice's final offer."
