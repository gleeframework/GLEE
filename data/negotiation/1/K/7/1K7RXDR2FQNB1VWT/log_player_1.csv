"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) and slightly above what I believe Bob might be willing to pay ($100 + a little room for negotiation). 
* **Positive Message:**  A friendly message sets a positive tone and encourages Bob to engage. 
* **10 Rounds:** Knowing I have 10 rounds, I want to leave room for negotiation. 
* **John as Backup:**  The knowledge that John is willing to pay $150 gives me a safety net if Bob doesn't meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is key:**  I have 10 rounds, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better price. 
* **John is a safety net:** If the negotiation doesn't go my way, I have John as a guaranteed buyer at a price I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. $100 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $125?  That's still a great deal for such a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by moving down from my initial offer, but not too far.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone keeps the negotiation amicable.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to justify my price.
* **Strategic Middle Ground:**  $125 is a middle ground between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's initial offer, potentially enticing him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $125 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $112.50. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $112.50 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Room for negotiation:** I have 6 rounds left, and I believe I can negotiate a higher price.
* **John remains the backup:** I can always sell to John for $150 if needed.
* **Strategic counteroffer:**  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my desired price to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $112.50 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $120.  This is a fair price for the value this product offers, and it's a good compromise."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise Again:** I'm continuing to demonstrate flexibility by reducing my price, but not by much.  This shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal but also have a firm understanding of the product's worth. 
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Focus on Compromise:**  I'm using phrases like ""fair price"" and ""good compromise"" to make the offer sound appealing and reasonable.
* **Strategic Middle Ground:**  $120 is a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's current offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $120 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $115. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $115 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I have 4 rounds left, and Bob has declared his offer ""final"" but has shown willingness to negotiate.
* **John remains the backup:**  I have the option to sell to John at a better price if needed.
* **Strategic counteroffer:** I'm going to counter with a price that's closer to my desired price but still shows flexibility to reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand it's your final price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $115, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $117.50? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.  I'm confident you won't regret owning this product."", ""product_price"": 117.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Halfway Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating flexibility by meeting Bob halfway, but still staying above my minimum.
* **Emphasize Fairness:** I'm using phrases like ""fair compromise"" to make the offer sound appealing and reasonable.
* **Product Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth to justify my price.
* **Limited Rounds:** I have only 3 rounds left, so I need to make a strategic move to potentially close the deal.
* **John as a safety net:** I still have the option of selling to John if this offer is rejected."
