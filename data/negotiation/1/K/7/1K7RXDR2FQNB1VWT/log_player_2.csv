"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $100. It's wise to reject and start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:** 
This counteroffer is a bold move, but it's justified. It establishes your maximum price point and leaves room for negotiation without you having to increase your offer. If Alice is truly interested in selling, she may be willing to consider your offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. $100 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $125?  That's still a great deal for such a valuable product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above your budget. Rejecting her offer allows you to counteroffer again and try to bring the price down further. While buying from John is an option, there's still potential to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $125 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $112.50. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 112.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows you are willing to negotiate and meet halfway.
* **Reasonable Price:** $112.50 is a good compromise point that is still within your budget, while also giving Alice a decent price.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This price still leaves some room for Alice to potentially make a final counteroffer if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $112.50 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $120.  This is a fair price for the value this product offers, and it's a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice has lowered her price again, it's still above your budget of $100.  There's still room to negotiate, and you have more rounds to work with. Rejecting her offer keeps the negotiation going, and you might be able to get the price down further.  While John is a reliable alternative, you are getting close to a deal with Alice, so it's worth seeing if you can get the price down a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $120 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $115. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  This is your final offer, signaling that you are serious about getting a deal but not willing to go any higher. 
* **Compromise:** $115 is a compromise point, showing you are willing to meet halfway again.  
* **Pressure:** This counteroffer puts some pressure on Alice, as you've stated it's your final offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand it's your final price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $115, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $117.50? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.  I'm confident you won't regret owning this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $117.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $117.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your budget:** Alice's offer of $117.5 is just $7.50 above your maximum budget of $100.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only three rounds left, the risk of rejecting and ending up with John's price of $100 is significant.
* **Compromise:** Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, meeting you halfway again.

While it's not your ideal price, accepting this offer is a good strategy considering the limited time and the potential for a worse outcome."
