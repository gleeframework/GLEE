You've reached the final round of negotiations with Alice, and while she's come down in price, it's still above your desired budget.  You've made multiple counteroffers and shown your willingness to compromise, but it seems unlikely that Alice will go any lower.  

Rather than risk another round and potentially lose the chance to buy the product altogether, it's best to secure the product from John at your maximum budget of $1,000,000."
