"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $18,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than both your maximum budget ($10,000) and what John offers ($10,000). It makes no sense to accept an offer that's $8,000 over your budget when you have a guaranteed alternative."
