Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value) because you have John as a backup buyer.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **The Sweet Spot:**  Any price between $1,000,001 and $1,199,999 benefits both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 leaves very little room for Bob to see value.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I believe a price of $1,100,000 reflects its worth. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Respectful:**  The message is clear and acknowledges Bob's interest in the product.
* **Value-Based Pricing:** Instead of starting low and negotiating up, we're anchoring the price at a point where Bob sees substantial benefit ($100,000 less than his valuation).
* **Sense of Urgency:** The ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to act without feeling pressured.

**Important Note:** This is just one approach.  You could experiment with different prices and messaging strategies.  However, remember that being too aggressive (e.g., asking for $1,190,000) might make Bob walk away, even if it's a good deal for him."
