Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price close to the value the product holds for Bob, but still leaving some room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:**  I want to keep Bob engaged and interested in the deal. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This gives Bob a chance to feel like he's getting a good deal without feeling like he's being low-balled. 

**Important Notes:**

* This is just a starting point.  I'll be ready to adjust my price based on Bob's response and the flow of the negotiation.
* I'm keeping John in mind as a backup option, so I won't be afraid to walk away if Bob's offers become too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While $12,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $10,000.
* **Opportunity to negotiate further:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my ideal price point.
* **John is a backup:**  Having John as a backup option gives me leverage to push for a better deal from Bob. 

**Next Step:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price higher than $12,000 but lower than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest! While $12,000 is tempting, I'm looking for a bit more. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident this is a price that's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still getting closer to my desired price.
* **Focus on fairness:**  Highlighting the fairness of the price helps to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I'm not accepting his offer yet, indicating that I'm not desperate to sell and have options (like John)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12000. Would you be willing to consider $12500? It's still a good compromise, and I'm really interested in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,500 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While I would prefer a higher price, I recognize that I have already countered and it's possible that Bob won't budge further. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  There's a risk that Bob will walk away if I reject his offer, and I may end up selling to John for a lower price. 

**Conclusion:**  Accepting this offer allows me to secure a decent price while minimizing the risk of losing a sale altogether."
