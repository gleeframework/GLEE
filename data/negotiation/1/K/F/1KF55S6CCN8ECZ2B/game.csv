"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $8,000 to you, and I'm willing to go a bit lower than my minimum. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This still gives you a good price, and it's closer to my minimum. Let me know your thoughts.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $8,500 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. I'm willing to offer $7,000. That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $7,000 is still too low for me. How about $7,500? It's a fair compromise, and it allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's work together to make this happen.",7500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $7,250. That's a significant jump from my previous offer, and it shows how serious I am about buying this product from you.",7250.0,Bob,6,
