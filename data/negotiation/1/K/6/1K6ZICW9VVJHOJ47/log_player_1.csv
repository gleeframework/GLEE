Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round. While $10,500 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $10,750 is still too low for me. Let's try $10,900.  It's a small increase, but it gets us closer to an agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10900}
