"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, I can't accept $8,000.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is my lowest price.  This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to a fair price for me. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I am still unable to meet at $9,000, but I am willing to pay $8,500 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise for both of us. Please let me know if this is acceptable.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $8,500 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $8,750. This is a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm hoping we can finalize a deal. Let me know what you think.",8750.0,Alice,5,
