"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $105?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $100? That's a fair price for both of us, and it's still above my minimum. What do you say?",100.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $97.50? That's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to what I'm comfortable with.",97.5,Bob,4,
