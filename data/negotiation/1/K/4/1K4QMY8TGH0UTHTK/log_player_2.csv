It's always better to try to negotiate a lower price.  You can save a significant amount of money by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer."

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 25% discount from Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about getting a good deal, but it's still within a reasonable range."

While $900,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than my desired price.  I'll counteroffer again to see if we can find a middle ground."

I'm going to offer $800,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It shows I'm willing to meet her halfway, but I still want to save as much money as possible."
