"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I'd love to offer you. I'm asking $200 for it. I believe it's worth every penny, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $180. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",180.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $180 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. How about $190? That way we're both in the middle ground.",190.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $190 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $175. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",175.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. $175 is definitely closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more for the product. How about we split the difference at $182.50?  That would be a fair compromise.",182.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $182.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $175, so how about $165? I think that's a fair price for the product.",165.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. $165 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to come down a little more.  Let's try $170.  That's a good middle ground and I think it's fair to both of us.",170.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $170 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go a bit lower, so how about $160? I think that's a fair price for the product.",160.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $165? That's just a little bit more than your last offer, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm confident you'll find this a good deal.",165.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $165. I'm willing to make one last offer of $155. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to consider buying from John for $150.",155.0,Bob,10,
