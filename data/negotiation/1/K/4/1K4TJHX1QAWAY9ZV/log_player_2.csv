"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. I believe my product is a valuable asset, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,000,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  It's important to start negotiating to get a better price.  While buying from John is an option, it's worth trying to get a better deal from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for your product. This reflects the value I see in it while still being within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $750,000. Considering its value to me, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price that meets you halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if they can reach a mutually acceptable price.  Buying from John is always an option, but Bob wants to try and get the best deal possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $850,000.  This is a significant offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product fairly.  Let's work together to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850,000. Considering its value to me, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that takes into account the value you see in the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still too high for Bob. He's already reached his maximum budget in his previous counteroffer. Buying from John at $800,000 is the best option to ensure he gets the product within his budget."
