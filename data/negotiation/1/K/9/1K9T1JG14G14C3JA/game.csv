"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,175,000? That way we both get a fair deal. Let me know your thoughts!",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,120,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, how about we settle on $1,140,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe we can both be happy with this deal. What do you think?",1140000.0,Alice,5,
