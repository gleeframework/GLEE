Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  $1,250,000 is still less than what the product is worth to you, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **It shows flexibility:** You're not starting at your absolute maximum price, indicating you're open to a deal. 
* **It's a positive message:** You're framing it as a good opportunity for Bob, increasing the chances of him accepting.

If Bob rejects this offer, you'll have to analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing to negotiate or if you'd be better off selling to John for your minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to Bob's perceived value, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to you.  You have a better chance of getting closer to your desired price by continuing the negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

You should send a counteroffer to Bob that's closer to your initial offer but still reflects the fact that you're willing to negotiate.  Something like $1,200,000 would be a reasonable starting point.  Be prepared to continue the back-and-forth until you reach a price that is mutually acceptable or you decide to sell to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,175,000? That way we both get a fair deal. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer that's closer to your desired price:** This offer is halfway between your previous offer ($1,250,000) and Bob's offer ($1,100,000). This demonstrates that you're willing to negotiate, but not at a price that undervalues the product.
* **Positive and persuasive message:**  You're framing it as a mutually beneficial compromise, making it more likely Bob will accept. 
* **Continuing the negotiation:**  You're showing Bob that you're willing to keep discussing the price.  This strategy helps you reach a mutually agreeable price. 

Remember, you want to find a price that is acceptable to both of you, but also gets you as close as possible to your minimum value. Keep your target price in mind, and be prepared to make more counteroffers if necessary.  You can always choose to sell to John if negotiations with Bob stall or don't lead to a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,100,000. How about we meet at $1,120,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,120,000 is closer to your minimum value, it's still quite a significant distance. You have two options:

* **Accept Bob's offer:**  This would be a quick and easy sale, but you'd be leaving a considerable amount of money on the table.
* **Reject Bob's offer:** This gives you the chance to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price. 

Given the potential to earn more,  continuing the negotiation seems like the better option. 

**Next Steps:**

You should send a counteroffer to Bob that's slightly higher than his offer but still reflects a willingness to compromise. Something like $1,150,000 would be a reasonable starting point.  Be prepared to continue the back-and-forth until you reach a price that is mutually acceptable or you decide to sell to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,120,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, how about we settle on $1,140,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe we can both be happy with this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1140000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer that's closer to your desired price:** This offer is halfway between your previous offer ($1,175,000) and Bob's offer ($1,120,000), showing flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Positive and persuasive message:** You frame it as a fair deal that reflects the product's value, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and fairness.
* **Continuing the negotiation:** You show Bob you're still open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement, increasing the likelihood of a successful negotiation.

Remember, you're getting closer to your desired price with each counteroffer. Be prepared to continue this back-and-forth,  always keeping in mind your minimum price and the option of selling to John if the negotiations with Bob stall."
