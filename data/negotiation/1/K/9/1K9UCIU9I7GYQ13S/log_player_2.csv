"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price that reflects the quality and value you'll be getting.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

Alice's offer is within your budget, and it's only $500 more than what John is offering.  It's a good deal considering the potential for further negotiation could lead to more back and forth."
