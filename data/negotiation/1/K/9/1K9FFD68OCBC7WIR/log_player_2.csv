"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this exceptional product for a price of $1,000,000. I understand its value to you, and this price reflects its true worth. However, if you choose to decline, I have another buyer, John, who is eager to purchase it at the same price.  I believe this is a fair offer, and I hope you consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice is clearly trying to signal that you won't get a better price elsewhere.  Since you have John as a backup option at the same price, you lose nothing by rejecting Alice's offer. There's a chance you could find an even better deal elsewhere."
