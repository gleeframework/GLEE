Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $95.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $95 is a good starting point, as it's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies flexibility and openness to discussing the price. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth negotiating further or if I should sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $80 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:**  While $80 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $100.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Selling to John for $100 offers a significantly better outcome. 
* **Negotiation Leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage to potentially secure a higher price in future rounds.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my target, hoping to find a middle ground. 
* If he rejects again, I'll likely move to selling to John as the risk of a lower price is not worth it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $80 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $90 to make this work.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum.
* **Reiterating Value:** My message highlights the value of the product and my willingness to negotiate.
* **Direct and Clear:**  The message is concise and clarifies the counteroffer for a quick decision.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've secured a decent price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll have to carefully consider my options. I'm getting closer to my minimum, but still above Bob's offer.  I'll need to assess if further negotiation is worthwhile or if selling to John is the best choice."
