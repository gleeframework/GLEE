"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my usual asking price. Let me know if you're interested.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. That's my maximum budget for this purchase. Can you meet me at that price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to be closer to my original offer of $1,200,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This price still gives you a good deal while ensuring I'm able to make a reasonable profit.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you want to make a profit, but I'm not willing to go above $1,000,000. How about we meet at $980,000? That's the highest I'm willing to go, and it's still a significant discount from your original price of $1,500,000.",980000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but $980,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be at least $1,020,000. This is a fair compromise, and it ensures both of us are happy with the deal. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm afraid $1,020,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so how about we meet at $1,009,000? That's the highest I'm willing to go, and it's still a great deal for both of us.",1009000.0,Bob,6,
