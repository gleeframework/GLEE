"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get a great deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. It's a great price, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $10,000 is more than Bob's budget, and he can potentially get a better deal by negotiating or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $8,000 for the product. It's my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I place on it."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. It's a fair compromise, considering the value I place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $9,500 is closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate further or buy from John for $8,000.  There's room for improvement, and it's worth exploring those options before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still only able to offer $8,500.  It's a fair price considering the value I place on the product and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $9,800. It's still a great deal, considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. At this point, Alice is not willing to budge below $9,800, which is still above Bob's budget. John offers a guaranteed price of $8,000, which is within Bob's budget and offers the best deal available."
