Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $12,000. 
* **My Minimum:**  I need at least $10,000 for the product, as John will buy it for that price.
* **Negotiation:** I want to maximize my profit while still leaving room for Bob to get a good deal.  A price of $11,500 is a good middle ground.

This strategy aims to:

* **Increase my profit:**  I earn $1,500 more than John's offer.
* **Maximize chances of a deal:**  Bob gets a good deal compared to his valuation, making him more likely to accept."
