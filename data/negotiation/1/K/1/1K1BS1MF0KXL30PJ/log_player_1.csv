Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $5,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $5,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? I believe that's a fair price for this quality product."", ""product_price"": 7500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $7,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $6,000. Would you consider $6,200? I'm very interested in the product, and that's a price I'm comfortable with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,200

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I can see you're serious about the product. How about we split the difference and call it $6,850? This would be my final offer."", ""product_price"": 6850}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I understand this is your final offer, but I'm afraid I can't quite meet that number. I'm willing to stretch my budget to $6,500. That's a fair deal for both of us, and it lets me walk away with the product I want. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is engaging in the negotiation, he's still significantly below my minimum price.  It's unlikely he'll reach $8,000. Taking the guaranteed $8,000 from John is the best decision at this point."
