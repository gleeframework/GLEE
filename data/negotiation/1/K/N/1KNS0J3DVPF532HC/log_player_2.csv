"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $14,000 is below your maximum budget, there's a good chance you could get a better price. Alice is starting high, leaving room for negotiation or for you to get a better deal from John."
