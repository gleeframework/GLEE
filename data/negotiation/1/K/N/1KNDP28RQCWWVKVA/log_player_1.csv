I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This leaves a significant margin for Bob while also ensuring I earn a substantial profit.  I'm confident Bob will find this offer attractive as it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is a decent price, I believe I can get closer to my target of $1,000,000 by counter-offering.  I'm confident I can secure a better deal through continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm countering with $975,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer, demonstrating that I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my initial goal. I believe this is a fair compromise that will encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $940,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to meet my price expectations.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,000,000, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially lose out on a sale entirely.  Selling to John at $800,000 ensures a guaranteed profit and is a more secure option at this point."
