"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree this product is a good fit, the price point is a little high for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,200,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
