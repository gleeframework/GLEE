"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows for potential concessions in the following rounds. I'm also aiming to build rapport by highlighting the value of the product to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a better agreement. How about $10,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I have 10 rounds to negotiate and can still potentially reach a more favorable agreement with Bob.  Selling to John immediately would be a missed opportunity.  

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer.  This will demonstrate my willingness to negotiate while also maintaining a position of strength."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is unfortunately not feasible for me.  However, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $11,500? This would still represent a good value for you, and allow me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I think we can find a middle ground. How about $11,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still have several rounds to negotiate and can potentially reach a higher price.  Selling to John at this point would leave money on the table. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. I'm aiming for a gradual approach to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $11,000 is closer to what I need, but I'm still a bit away from my target.  Would you consider $11,250? This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great value for you given the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad we're making progress. Considering the value of the product, how about $11,125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,125 is still below my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum acceptable price and we're approaching the final rounds.  I've already rejected several offers from Bob and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  Selling to John at this point would result in a higher price but there's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer from Bob in the remaining rounds."
