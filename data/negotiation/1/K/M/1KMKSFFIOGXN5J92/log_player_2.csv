"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is within his budget, it's still more than he'd ideally like to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows him to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  He's offering $13,000, which is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for Alice to make some profit.  This move shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also willing to push for a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has rejected Alice's initial offer and made a counteroffer. Alice has countered with $13,500, which is still within Bob's budget and a better deal than buying from John. This is a reasonable compromise, and Bob should accept to save $500 compared to buying from John."
