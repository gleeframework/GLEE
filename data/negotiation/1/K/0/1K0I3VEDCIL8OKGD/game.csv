"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand it's a significant investment, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $650,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects both the product's value and my budget.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $700,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",700000.0,Alice,5,
