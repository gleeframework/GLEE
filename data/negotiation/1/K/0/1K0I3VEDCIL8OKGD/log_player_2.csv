Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand it's a significant investment, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $700,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.

At this point, Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. While we could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she'll hold firm or the difference won't be substantial enough to warrant the risk of losing the deal. $700,000 is a good price compared to John's offer and our initial goal."
