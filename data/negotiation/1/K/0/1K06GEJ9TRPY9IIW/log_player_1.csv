"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:**  I've started with $12,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000, but it still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:**  I've kept the message friendly and positive, emphasizing the value the product offers to Bob. 

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to start with a strong offer that is attractive to Bob but still within my acceptable range. I want to see if he's willing to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer and the remaining rounds. I also have the safety net of selling to John for $15,000 if the negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'm interested in selling to Bob, his offer is too low at this point. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I'll use this opportunity to make a counteroffer that is closer to my minimum price, but still potentially appealing to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a significant discount for me, but I'm confident the product will be worth it for you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I've reduced my price from $12,000 to $10,500. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.  
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's budget constraints but emphasize the value proposition of the product.  I aim to build a sense of cooperation and find a solution that benefits both of us.

**Strategy:**

I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum value. This counteroffer represents a significant reduction from my initial offer, indicating my willingness to negotiate. I hope this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price. If he rejects again, I will continue to adjust my offer based on his counteroffers and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $9,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, it's still significantly below my desired range.  

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.  I'll aim for a price closer to my minimum value, while still acknowledging Bob's budget constraints.  I'll adjust my counteroffers based on his responses and the remaining rounds. If we don't reach a mutually agreeable price, I have the option to sell to John for $15,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to drop to $10,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both our needs.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I've reduced my price again to $10,000, which is closer to Bob's latest offer of $9,500. This demonstrates my continued willingness to compromise.
* **Message:** I acknowledge that we are getting closer to an agreement and emphasize the fairness of the new price. I aim to build momentum and encourage Bob to accept the offer.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to continue narrowing the gap between our offers while staying within my acceptable price range.  I believe $10,000 is a reasonable middle ground that both parties can agree on.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to re-evaluate my options and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John. With only 5 rounds remaining, the pressure is on to secure a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired range and leaves me with less profit.  I'm not willing to accept this offer at this point. 

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.  I'll aim for a price closer to my minimum value, while still acknowledging Bob's budget constraints.  I'll adjust my counteroffers based on his responses and the remaining rounds. If we don't reach a mutually agreeable price, I have the option to sell to John for $15,000.  I have four rounds left, and I'm still hopeful we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget, but I'm also running out of time.  My absolute lowest I can go is $9,750.  This is a significant discount for me, but it's the best I can offer.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I've reduced my price to $9,750, which is just a slight increase from Bob's latest offer of $9,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise but also that I have a limit.
* **Message:** I reiterate Bob's budget constraints but also emphasize my time constraint, increasing the pressure to reach an agreement. I make it clear that this is my final offer.

**Strategy:**

With only three rounds left, I'm taking a more assertive approach.  I'm signaling that this is my final offer, pushing Bob to make a decision. I'm confident that $9,750 is still a good price for him, especially considering he values the product at $8,000. If he rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,750, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, which is the maximum I can afford. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds remaining, Bob's final offer of $9,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, it's clear that we won't be able to reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds.

**Strategy:**

Given the limited time and the fact that John is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price, it's in my best interest to sell to John. This will ensure I achieve my desired profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
