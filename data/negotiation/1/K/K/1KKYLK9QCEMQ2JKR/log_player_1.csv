Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $200. I believe it offers excellent value at this price."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $150. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob's offer is his ceiling price and it's not worthwhile to continue negotiating. Accepting a price below my minimum would be a loss. John offers a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price."
