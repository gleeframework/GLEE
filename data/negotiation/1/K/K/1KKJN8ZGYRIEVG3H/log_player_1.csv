"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $15000 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

$8,000 is below my minimum, so I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I appreciate your interest!  $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $11,500?  This is still a great price for a product that's worth much more.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 11500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still hoping to find a deal that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $9500.  This is a fair price for a product of this quality. Let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  $9,500 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  Let's try $10,500.  It's a good deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to keep talking.  $10500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $9500.  This is a fair price for the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I've reached a point where I'm not confident I can get a better price from Bob.  It's better to sell to John and guarantee a profit."
