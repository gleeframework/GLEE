"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is at your maximum price.** There's no immediate benefit to accepting. 
* **Rejecting allows for negotiation.**  You might be able to get a lower price from Alice.
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.**  It's good to have, but you're better off trying to negotiate with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting strong:**  A significant counteroffer shows Alice you're serious about negotiation and willing to walk away.
* **Reasonable range:** $1,100,000 is still within your budget and a good starting point for negotiation.  
* **Leaving room for compromise:** This allows for potential adjustments during future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is moving closer to your desired price:** $1,180,000 is better than her initial offer, but there's still room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting maintains leverage:**  You've shown a willingness to walk away, so Alice might be motivated to come down further. 
* **Buying from John is still a backup:** But you're getting closer to a deal with Alice, so it's wise to keep negotiating for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:**  A smaller counteroffer shows you're willing to compromise while still pushing for a better price.
* **Maintaining momentum:** You're showing Alice that you're serious about negotiation and willing to meet her halfway. 
* **Approaching your target:** This offer is closer to your ideal price while leaving room for potential concessions from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,165,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,165,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer to your desired price:**  $1,165,000 is significantly lower than her initial offer and getting closer to your ideal price.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** You've already had several rounds of negotiation, and the likelihood of Alice going lower is uncertain. There's a chance you could end up with a higher price if you keep rejecting.
* **Opportunity cost:** Continuing to negotiate risks running out of rounds and having to buy from John at a higher price.  

**Overall:**  At this point, accepting Alice's offer secures a good deal within your budget and limits the risk of a worse outcome."
