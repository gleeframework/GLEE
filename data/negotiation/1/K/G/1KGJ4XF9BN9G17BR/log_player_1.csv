Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer allows you to earn $14,000 from Bob, which is less than you would get from John, but still a substantial amount. This strategy is based on the idea of maximizing your potential earnings while still leaving room for a negotiation with Bob.  

Here's why this approach is good:

* **It's better than a flat-out ""no deal"" scenario:** If you offered $15,000 to Bob, and he rejected it, you would still get $15,000 from John. This approach allows you to potentially make a deal with Bob.
* **It creates room for negotiation:** Bob might be willing to pay closer to your desired price, especially if he wants the product and sees the offer as a good deal. 
* **It's not too aggressive:** This offer is still a significant discount for Bob, but not so low that he might be offended or feel like you're not serious about selling it to him."
