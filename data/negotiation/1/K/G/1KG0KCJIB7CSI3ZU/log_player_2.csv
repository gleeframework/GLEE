"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, even more so than it is to me. I'm willing to offer it to you first at a premium price of $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $750,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000.  This offer stands as long as we close the deal this round. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","Alice is still trying to get a high price for the product. I'm not willing to pay $1,250,000. That's still too expensive for me. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'm still interested in the product, but I need to get closer to my budget. I'll try to meet Alice halfway between $750,000 and $1,250,000. Let's say... $1,000,000.

{""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I still think $1,000,000 is the maximum I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
