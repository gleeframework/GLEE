Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value, but I'm hoping to strike a deal quickly.  If Bob rejects, I'll have more information to work with for future rounds."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can do better.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm offering $13,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm selling the product to John. Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, but I'm running out of time.  It's better to guarantee myself the $15,000 than risk ending up with less."
