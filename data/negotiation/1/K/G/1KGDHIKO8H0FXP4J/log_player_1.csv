"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $700,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $850,000 is still out of my budget. I'm confident that $750,000 is a fair price for both of us. Let's work together to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is moving closer to my desired price, he's doing so very slowly.  At this pace, it's unlikely we'll reach a price that's significantly higher than what John is offering. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price without further negotiation and potential wasted time."
