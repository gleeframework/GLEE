Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $14,500. "",
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Secure the Higher Sale:**  While John offers a safety net at $10,000, Bob's higher valuation makes him the more profitable target. 

By offering the product at $14,500, Alice leaves herself room to potentially lower the price slightly if Bob negotiates, while still securing a significantly higher profit than selling to John."
