"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find immensely valuable.  Given its worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,500,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000. This feels like a fair price considering the value we both recognize in the product.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
