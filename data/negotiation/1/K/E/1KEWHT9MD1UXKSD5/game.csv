"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I believe it's worth a significant amount of money, and I'm willing to part with it for $900000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $900000 is out of my price range. I'm very interested in this product, but my maximum budget is $750000. Would you be willing to consider that?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $825000 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $800000, my absolute maximum.  This is a fair price, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.  Let's close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $815000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",815000.0,Alice,5,
