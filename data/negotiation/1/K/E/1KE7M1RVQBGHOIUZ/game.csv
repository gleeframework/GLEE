"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I believe this reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth is $800,000 to you.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, I believe the value of this product is considerably higher than your proposal.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000. This is a fair offer considering its potential.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good price for the product, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $775,000 for it. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you is $800,000.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing some progress in our negotiations.  To show I'm flexible, I'm willing to accept $875,000 for the product. I believe this price represents a fair deal for both of us.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $875,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. I hope we can meet in the middle.",800000.0,Bob,6,
