{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'll sell the product to John.  We've reached a point where Bob and I seem to be stuck.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, it's becoming clear that we're not going to find common ground. John is a reliable buyer and offers a secure sale at a price that meets my minimum threshold. I'd rather close the deal now than risk losing even more time and money in further negotiations."
