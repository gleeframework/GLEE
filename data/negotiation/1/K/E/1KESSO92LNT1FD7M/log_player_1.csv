""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $12,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Offering it at $15,000 is unlikely to be accepted as Bob gains no benefit. We need to leave some ""meat on the bone"" for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a safety net with John at $8,000, so we can be a bit more ambitious with our pricing to Bob. 

By offering the product at $12,000, we're aiming for a significant profit while still making the deal attractive to Bob."
