"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to acquire this truly valuable product. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally good negotiation practice to start with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for concessions and gives the impression you have room to move. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $2,000,000, I'm anchoring the negotiation high. Even though it's above Bob's perceived value, it sets a frame of reference that might influence his counteroffer.
* **Leaving Room for John:** Offering at $2,000,000 leaves significant room to negotiate down while still potentially exceeding John's offer of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is tempting as it's above his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum and John's offer. Rejecting now allows me to:

* **Counter towards my goal:** I can make a counteroffer steering the price closer to my desired range. 
* **Gauge Bob's flexibility:**  His counteroffer was a substantial jump, indicating he might be willing to negotiate further.
* **John remains an option:** I can always fall back on selling to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table.  While your offer is certainly thoughtful, the value of this product goes beyond that.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,700,000?"",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I've made a significant concession from my initial offer, signaling flexibility to Bob.
* **Middle Ground:**  Offering $1,700,000 positions the negotiation closer to a potential agreement point while staying above both Bob's valuation and John's offer.
* **Maintaining Value:** The message emphasizes the inherent value of the product, justifying a higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're still confident in the product's value, but I'm trying to be reasonable. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,500,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches John's offer. There is no strategic advantage to continuing negotiations with Bob or holding out for a potentially higher offer. Accepting Bob's offer secures the $1,500,000 immediately."
