"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to come down to $110?",110.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position.  While $110 is a fair price, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price.  How about $112?  It's a small difference, and I think it's a good compromise.",112.0,Alice,3,
