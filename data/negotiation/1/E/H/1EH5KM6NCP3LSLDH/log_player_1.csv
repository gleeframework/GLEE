Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe this price reflects its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, hoping to gauge Bob's interest. I want to leave some room for negotiation but also signal that I believe the product is valuable.  I'm not overly aggressive, but I'm also not afraid to start high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1000000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1500000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I believe there's still room to negotiate a better price.  I'm going to try to get closer to my initial asking price before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,500,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. It's still a great deal considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price closer to my budget. How about $1600000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,600,000 is a good deal and is well above my minimum.  I'm starting to run out of rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether."
