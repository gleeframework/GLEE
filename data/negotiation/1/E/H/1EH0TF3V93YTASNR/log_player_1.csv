Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $175. I believe it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $150 (John), you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Offering the product at $175 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate the price down, while still ensuring you make a profit.
* **Polite and suggestive language:** The message is framed positively, highlighting the product's value and inviting Bob's opinion. This approach can make Bob more receptive to the offer."
