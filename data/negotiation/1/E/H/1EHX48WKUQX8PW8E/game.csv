"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,500?  I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth the investment.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,500. Would you be willing to meet in the middle?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $7,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $8,000. This would be a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
