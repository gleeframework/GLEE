"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11,250. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",11250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,250 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm happy to split the difference and offer $11,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product and allows us both to walk away with a win.",11000.0,Bob,4,
