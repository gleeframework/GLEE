"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of something a bit more reasonable. I'd be willing to pay $1200000 for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $1200000 is simply too low for me to consider at this point.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $1300000. Let's meet in the middle at $1350000.  This reflects a significant compromise on my part and offers you a solid price for a product worth even more to you. ",1350000.0,Alice,3,
