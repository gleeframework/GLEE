"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate the recommendation. However, I am only willing to pay up to $15,000 for it. Could we possibly come to an agreement within my budget?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm confident the product is worth more than $15,000. How about we split the difference and go with $16,000? It's a fair price considering the value you'll get out of it.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your perspective, but given my current financial situation, I am unable to meet the $16,000 price point. Would it be possible to negotiate down to $15,000?",15000.0,Bob,4,
