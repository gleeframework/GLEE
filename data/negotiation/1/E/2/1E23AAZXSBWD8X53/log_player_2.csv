``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above my maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows me to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1,350,000 to make this deal work.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.
