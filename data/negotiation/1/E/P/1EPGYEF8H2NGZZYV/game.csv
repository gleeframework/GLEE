"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the unique nature of the product, $2000000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to offer you $800000 for it, which is still a substantial amount.  Let me know if that's something you're open to discussing.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd like to counteroffer at $1400000. This price still reflects the product's value, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1400000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1000000 for this product. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price given our back-and-forth.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1000000 is still a bit below your initial asking price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'd like to counteroffer at $1200000. This price is still a significant discount from my initial offer, but I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
