Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential value, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair price given the product's worth and my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,200,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a fair compromise that would allow us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
