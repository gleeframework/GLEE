"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential value, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair price given the product's worth and my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 is a significant offer, I can't let go of this product for less than $1,200,000. It's a small concession, but I believe it represents a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,200,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a fair compromise that would allow us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
