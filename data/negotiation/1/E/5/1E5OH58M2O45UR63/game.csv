"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me at that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm open to negotiation, $80 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $87.50? ",87.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can we meet at that price?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is still a bit low for me. How about we compromise at $88? That's only $3 away from your offer, and it gets me closer to what I need.",88.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $88 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you at $82.50. That's a good deal for both of us, don't you think?",82.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $82.50 is closer to what I'm looking for, I can't quite go that low yet.  How about we meet in the middle at $85?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal.",85.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle, Alice. I'm willing to go a bit lower than $82.50, but I'm not willing to go back up to $85. How about $81.25? That's as low as I'm willing to go.",81.25,Bob,8,
