"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique value and potential,"" I'm subtly justifying the high price without revealing my hand.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and encourages Bob's input, setting the stage for a potential counteroffer. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while leaving the door open for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for reaching out. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is above his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I have room to negotiate and plenty of rounds left. I'll aim to steer the price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product significantly exceeds $1,200,000.  I'm confident it can generate substantial returns for your business, which is why I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we agree on $1,750,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging the Counteroffer:** I want to maintain a positive and collaborative tone by recognizing Bob's attempt to find common ground.
* **Reiterating Value:** By re-emphasizing the product's potential for ""substantial returns,"" I'm reminding Bob of its worth beyond his initial valuation.
* **Strategic Concession:**  While I'm not accepting his offer, I'm demonstrating flexibility by making a significant move from my initial price. This shows a willingness to negotiate while keeping the deal significantly above my minimum.
* **Anchoring:** By proposing $1,750,000, I'm setting a new anchor point closer to my desired outcome, hoping to guide future offers in that direction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still working within a specific budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,500,000. I hope this offers a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met my absolute minimum acceptable price. While I could try to push for a slightly higher amount in subsequent rounds, there's a risk he might walk away. Accepting now secures the best possible outcome in this scenario."
