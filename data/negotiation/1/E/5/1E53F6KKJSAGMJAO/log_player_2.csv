Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll offer it to you for $12,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob. However, I still need to get a bit closer to my target price. I'll offer it to you for $12,250. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

At this point, Alice is very unlikely to go below $12,000. She's marked this as her ""final offer"" and her price reductions are getting smaller. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially paying more than John's offer."
