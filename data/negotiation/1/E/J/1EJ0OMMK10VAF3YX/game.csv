,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to offer $140. Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $180. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $180 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to compromise and offer $160. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",160.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $160. I'm willing to come down to $170, but I think that's as low as I can go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from there.",170.0,Alice,5,
