"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable product, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You are aiming to get the product for under $800,000. Rejecting the offer allows you to counter with a lower price and potentially get a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $825,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair price considering our previous discussions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $825,000 is closer to your target, it's still above your ideal price point. You can try to negotiate further and see if you can get the price down closer to your budget.  Rejecting allows you to counter with a lower price and potentially secure a better deal."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $825,000 is still slightly out of my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $800,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget constraints.  Let's close this deal and finalize the purchase."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $850,000 is still above your budget. You have already made a counteroffer at your target price of $800,000 and Alice has rejected it.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice might lead to further counteroffers and delays, potentially costing you more in the long run.

Since John is offering the product for $800,000, which is within your budget, it's the most sensible option to go with John to avoid further negotiation and secure the product at your desired price."
