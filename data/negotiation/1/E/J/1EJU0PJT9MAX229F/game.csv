"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $12,800. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. What do you think?",12800.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a fair price for you, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I've already met you halfway, and I think I've been very reasonable. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we settle at $12,400?",12400.0,Alice,5,
