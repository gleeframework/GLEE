Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $15,000, getting Bob to buy it at a higher price earns more profit.
* **Finding a Balance:**  Offering the product for $12,000  is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still offers him a substantial saving compared to your guaranteed sale price to John.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** The message uses language like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""limited-time offer"" to encourage Bob to make a decision quickly and potentially increase his perceived value of the product."
