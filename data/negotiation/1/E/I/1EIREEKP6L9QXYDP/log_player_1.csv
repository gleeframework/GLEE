Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a bit lower than the $15,000 value to Bob, giving him a potential profit of $1000. It's also higher than your minimum of $10,000, so it's still profitable for you. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring Bob is motivated enough to accept the offer."
