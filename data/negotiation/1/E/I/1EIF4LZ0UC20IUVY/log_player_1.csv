"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to offer it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects the significant value it will bring to your business."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's willingness to pay. 
* **Close to Bob's Value:** Aiming close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) increases the chances of him accepting immediately, securing a high profit.
* **Confident Justification:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob's business helps justify the high price and demonstrates your understanding of his needs.

This initial offer aims to maximize profit while still leaving room for negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am interested in purchasing the product, but I would like to propose a price of $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good offer, it's still significantly below Bob's perceived value of the product ($1,200,000) and leaves a substantial amount of potential profit on the table.  There's room for negotiation. 

It's too early to sell to John for $800,000. We can likely negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (But Not Too Much):**  By suggesting a price of $1,075,000, we're showing a willingness to negotiate and find a compromise. However, we're not drastically reducing our price, keeping us firmly in the profitable range.
* **Reiterating Value:**  Emphasizing the product's value again reinforces its worth in Bob's mind and justifies the higher price point.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while still leaving room for further adjustments if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. While I respect the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $1,025,000. This seems to be a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** $1,025,000 is a significant profit over our minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Bob's offer demonstrates a willingness to compromise.  Meeting in the middle is often a sign of a fair negotiation. 
* **Time Considerations:** We're approaching the halfway point of our negotiation rounds.  Continuing to push for a higher price might not yield a significantly better result and risks Bob walking away. 

While we could potentially squeeze out a bit more, the risk likely outweighs the potential reward at this point. Accepting $1,025,000 secures a very favorable outcome."
