Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in it. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $900000 to $1000000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
