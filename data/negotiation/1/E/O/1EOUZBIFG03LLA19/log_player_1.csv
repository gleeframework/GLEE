Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only pay up to $100 for it. Would you be able to accommodate this price?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is far too low. It's worth more than that to me and I have a guaranteed buyer in John.  I'll counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $130 is the absolute lowest I can go.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 130}

Round 4

While $110 is getting closer, it's still not enough. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can get closer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $110 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, but  $120 is the lowest I can go.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts in trying to reach an agreement. I'm willing to pay $115 for the product. Could this be a feasible solution for both of us? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $115 is getting close to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm not sure how much lower Bob is willing to go, but I'll try one more counteroffer before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $115 just isn't enough.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $117.50, is that something you can do?"", ""product_price"": 117.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $116. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $116
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $116 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it still falls short.  With only two rounds left, I'm not sure I can get Bob to meet my minimum.  To ensure I get a good price, I'm going to sell to John."
