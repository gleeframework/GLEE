"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product.  Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I believe $1,100,000 is a bit high given my assessment of the product's value.  I'm willing to offer $950,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm confident it can bring you a substantial return on investment. I can go down to $1,050,000,  but that's my final offer.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which would still allow you a good profit. Let's bridge the gap and make this deal happen.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
