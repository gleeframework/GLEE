"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to encourage negotiation but still maintain a healthy profit margin for myself. 
* I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, emphasizing the potential benefits he can gain from the purchase.
* By leaving room for negotiation, I can potentially reach a price closer to my target of $1,500,000. 
* If Bob rejects this offer, I can adjust my strategy for the next rounds depending on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.**  I cannot afford to sell it for that amount.
* **I have several rounds left to negotiate.** I want to see if I can get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer. 
* **While selling to John is a safe option, I want to explore the negotiation with Bob further.** There's a chance I can get a better price than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to recoup a significant portion of the investment I made in this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price is still within a reasonable range for both of us, and it allows for a profitable transaction. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **I'm offering a compromise.** This price is closer to Bob's offer, but it's still well above my minimum acceptable price.
* **I'm emphasizing the need to recover my investment.** This helps justify the price and shows that I'm serious about negotiating a fair deal.
* **I'm expressing willingness to find a solution.** This creates a sense of collaboration and increases the likelihood of Bob accepting my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. How about $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin.** 
* **I have several rounds left.**  I want to see if I can push for a higher price by making a counteroffer and exploring the possibility of finding a more agreeable solution.
* **Selling to John is always an option, but I'm not ready to give up on negotiating with Bob just yet.** I believe there's room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation.  $1,250,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one last concession.  How about $1,350,000? This would allow us to both make a fair profit.  I believe this is a good compromise considering our past discussions."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **I'm demonstrating flexibility.**  I've moved closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm serious about reaching an agreement.
* **I'm emphasizing the potential for both of us to benefit.** This appeals to Bob's self-interest and makes the offer more attractive.
* **I'm framing this as a final concession.** This creates urgency and may encourage Bob to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your concession, but I'm afraid $1,350,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. How about $1,300,000? This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price.** I am willing to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation.
* **Selling to John would guarantee a higher price, but the risk of Bob backing out or another buyer appearing is high.**  It's safer to secure this deal with Bob.
* **Bob has stated this is his final offer and he's willing to walk away.  There's a real possibility that rejecting this offer could result in losing the deal altogether.**"
