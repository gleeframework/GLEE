"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I'm confident it would be equally valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a one-time opportunity, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
