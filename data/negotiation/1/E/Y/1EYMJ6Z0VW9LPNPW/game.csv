"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $90 is a bit steep for me. How about $85?",85.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $90 is a bit high for you, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50?",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  While $92.50 is closer, I'm still hoping for a bit more of a discount.  How about $87.50?  That's a fair compromise, and it keeps things moving.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway between $92.50 and $87.50, which is $90. I'll throw in a small discount, so how about we do $89.50?",89.5,Alice,5,
