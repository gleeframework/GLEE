"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible.  While $90 is better than $100, you can likely get a better deal.  There's no harm in rejecting and seeing if Alice will come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $90 is a bit steep for me. How about $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a reasonable counteroffer:**  $85 is a decent starting point, as it's a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still leaves some room for negotiation.
* **Show willingness to negotiate:** By suggesting a specific price and offering a message, you demonstrate that you're taking the negotiation seriously. 
* **Keep in mind your target price:**  Remember, you want to pay no more than $100, so be sure to stay within that limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $90 is a bit high for you, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still above your target price:** Even though Alice came down,  $92.50 is still higher than what you'd like to pay. 
* **There's still room to negotiate:** You've already shown a willingness to compromise, and Alice is showing a willingness to meet you halfway.  There's a good chance she'll come down further.
* **Don't be afraid to push:**  Rejecting the offer again shows you're serious about getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  While $92.50 is closer, I'm still hoping for a bit more of a discount.  How about $87.50?  That's a fair compromise, and it keeps things moving."", ""product_price"": 87.5} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stay within your target:**  $87.50 is still below your maximum budget of $100.
* **Show continued compromise:**  You're meeting Alice halfway again by offering a price in between her previous offer and your last counteroffer.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  Using phrases like ""fair compromise"" and ""keeps things moving"" keeps the negotiation amicable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway between $92.50 and $87.50, which is $90. I'll throw in a small discount, so how about we do $89.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your target:** $89.50 is only slightly above your ideal price, and you've already demonstrated your willingness to pay up to $90.
* **Further negotiation might be fruitless:** Alice is clearly sticking to a price close to her bottom line, and further negotiation might only lead to a stalemate or her walking away.
* **Time is a factor:**  You've already had a few rounds of negotiation, and time is running out.  It's better to secure a deal now than risk losing the product to another buyer or having to buy from John at a higher price."
