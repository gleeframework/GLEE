Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100."",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  While Bob only values the product at $80,  it's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than what you're willing to accept. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Offering it at $100 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring Alice gets a price significantly higher than Bob's valuation.
* **Considering the alternative:**  Knowing John will buy it for $120 gives Alice leverage. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose anything."
