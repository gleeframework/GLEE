Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $950,000. This is a significant concession, and I'm confident this price allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's try to find a middle ground.
