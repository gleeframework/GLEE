"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a unique and valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,750. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,600. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $8,700. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,700.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000.  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, but the price hasn't gone down enough to make her deal more appealing than John's. It's likely that further negotiation with Alice will result in a price of $8,500 or higher, making it less desirable than John's offer."
