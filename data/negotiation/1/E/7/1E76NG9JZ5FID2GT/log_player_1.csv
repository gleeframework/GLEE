``` 
 
This offer is high, but it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value. It's a bold opening move that shows confidence in the product's worth.  I'm also aiming to establish a high starting point to maximize my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for it. Could we meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, but I'm not ready to sell to John just yet. I want to see if I can push Bob a little higher. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
