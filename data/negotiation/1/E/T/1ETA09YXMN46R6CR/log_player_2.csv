"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is your maximum, there's no reason to accept Alice's first offer.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower, and it costs you nothing to see if she will."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount. This is aggressive, but it gives us room to negotiate.  It also signals to Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my offer, but there's still room for improvement.  I'm not in a rush, so I'll try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $10,500.  This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a lower price than her last offer.  It's a good middle ground for the next round of negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has matched my counteroffer. This is a good deal for me, as I'm getting the product for $1,500 less than my maximum. There's no reason to risk further negotiation and potentially losing the deal or ending up paying the same price as John."
