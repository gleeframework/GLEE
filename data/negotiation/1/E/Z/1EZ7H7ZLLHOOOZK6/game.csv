"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering John is offering a similar product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I appreciate your interest, $800,000 is significantly below the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still reflects its true worth.  Let's find a middle ground here.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product has value, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about $925,000? That's a significant move from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about purchasing.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 still doesn't reflect the unique value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $975,000 as a final compromise.  This is a fair price considering the product's potential and the fact that John is offering $1,000,000.  Let's make this deal happen.",975000.0,Alice,5,
