"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your offer. However, $1200000 is significantly below the value I place on this product. To find common ground, I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This still leaves room for a profitable transaction for both of us.  What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
