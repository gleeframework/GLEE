Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm getting close to walking away from this deal, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?

While I could push Bob further, he's signaled this is his final offer. Taking the $11,000 is a significant gain over John's $8,000."
