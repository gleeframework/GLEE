"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, your initial price is a bit too high for my budget.  I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable spending.  Perhaps we can agree on $700,000?  This offer shows I'm serious about buying while acknowledging the product's value.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I've received a compelling offer from another buyer for $1,000,000. I'd prefer to work with you, but I need to be realistic about my options. I'm willing to hold my offer at $1,050,000 for the next 24 hours. After that, I'll need to proceed with the other offer. This is your chance to acquire a valuable product at a price that reflects its worth.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
