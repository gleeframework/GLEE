"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value to you, I propose we start negotiations at $12,000. Let me know if this is within your budget or if you'd like to discuss further.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is quite steep for me right now. I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider something closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your current budget constraints. I would like to counter with an offer of $9,000 for the product. This is higher than my initial proposal, but still below your proposed price. I hope this helps us reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad you're open to negotiation, Bob. Considering our previous discussions, I propose we finalize the deal at $8,500 for the product. This is slightly above your last offer, but still below my initial asking price. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value you place on the product.",8500.0,Alice,5,
