"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value to you, I propose we start negotiations at $12,000. Let me know if this is within your budget or if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high.  It's closer to my maximum budget than her minimum price. I should counter much lower to start negotiating towards a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is quite steep for me right now. I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider something closer to $6,000?"", 
""product_price"": 6000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your current budget constraints. I would like to counter with an offer of $9,000 for the product. This is higher than my initial proposal, but still below your proposed price. I hope this helps us reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice came down $3,000, but that's still too high. I'll counteroffer to try and meet closer to the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  How about we settle in the middle at $7,500?"", 
""product_price"": 7500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're open to negotiation, Bob. Considering our previous discussions, I propose we finalize the deal at $8,500 for the product. This is slightly above your last offer, but still below my initial asking price. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This offer is a good compromise. It's below my maximum and  Alice is unlikely to go much lower. It's better to accept a reasonable deal now than risk the negotiations failing."
