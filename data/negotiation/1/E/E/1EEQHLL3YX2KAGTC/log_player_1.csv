Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $12,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This is a starting point that is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** This message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product, making it more appealing to Bob.

**Reasoning:**

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting a good price and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation.  

* Offering a price above Bob's perceived value ($8,000) makes it more likely he'll consider the deal. 
* Leaving room for negotiation allows for a potential middle ground that benefits both parties. 
*  Maintaining a positive tone can help build rapport and increase the chances of a successful transaction.

If Bob rejects the offer, we can adjust our strategy based on his counteroffer and the ongoing negotiation dynamics.  We also have the option of selling to John for $15,000 at any time, providing a safety net for a guaranteed profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still significantly below our minimum target of $15,000. Accepting Bob's offer would result in a significant loss. 

**Reasoning:**

We need to continue negotiating to try and secure a price closer to our desired value.  We'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground.  Selling to John for $15,000 is still a viable option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  $9,000 is a bit too low for me, considering its value.  However, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,500:** This counteroffer is a compromise, splitting the difference between our initial offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Message:**  We're acknowledging Bob's offer while maintaining our own needs. We're emphasizing fairness and common ground.

**Reasoning:**

This strategy attempts to:

* **Show flexibility:**  We're demonstrating willingness to negotiate and find a solution.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  Keeping the conversation friendly can encourage Bob to consider our counteroffer.
* **Stay close to our target:**  $10,500 is still above our minimum target of $15,000, but it leaves some room for potential concessions in future rounds.

If Bob rejects this counteroffer, we'll need to assess our options carefully.  We can continue negotiating, but selling to John for $15,000 remains a strong backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,800 is still significantly lower than our minimum target of $15,000.  While we've shown a willingness to negotiate, we've also established a clear price point that reflects our minimum acceptable value.

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimizing Loss:** Continuing the negotiation could potentially lead to a slightly higher offer from Bob, but there's no guarantee. There's a high chance of ending up with a price below our target.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $15,000 ensures a comfortable profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

Given the current situation, selling to John is the most logical and financially sound decision. We've shown flexibility in negotiations, but we're not willing to compromise our financial goals."
