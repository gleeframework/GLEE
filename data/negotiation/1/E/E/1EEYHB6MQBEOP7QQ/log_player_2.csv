Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $8,500 is still a bit below my target. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $9,200. This is the lowest I can go while still making a decent profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200.

It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Alice is very unlikely to go below $9,000, and you have a guaranteed offer for $8,000. Take the sure thing and maximize your savings."
