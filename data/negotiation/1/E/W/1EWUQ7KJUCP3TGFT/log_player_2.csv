"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You're looking to spend no more than $150.  Alice's offer of $120 is too high, but still better than John's price.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $100, which is still below my maximum price of $150 and a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's likely Alice will counter, but I hope to get a deal closer to my desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $110 is closer to my target price, I'm still not happy with it. I believe I can negotiate further and get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows me to try and bring the price down even lower.  There are still several rounds left, and I'm not desperate enough to accept a price that's still above my ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, showing some willingness to negotiate. I'm going to meet her halfway with an offer of $105. This shows I'm serious about buying, but I still want a better deal than her current offer. Hopefully, we can reach a compromise at this price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $115.  While this is still more than my ideal price, it's getting closer. I have limited rounds left and I don't want to risk her getting stubborn and sticking to her price. It's also much better than buying from John for $150. This is a good compromise and I'll accept the offer."
