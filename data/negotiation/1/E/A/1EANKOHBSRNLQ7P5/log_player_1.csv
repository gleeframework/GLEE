Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""value and potential"" aims to justify the high price. 
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While you know Bob values the product at $800,000, he doesn't know your minimum price.  Your offer should balance confidence with reasonability to avoid deterring him completely.
* **Negotiation:**  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Determine your lowest acceptable price beforehand."
