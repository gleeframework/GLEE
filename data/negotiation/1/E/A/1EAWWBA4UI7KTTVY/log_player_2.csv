"Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product from John for $800,000, and Alice is offering it for $750,000. There's room for negotiation to save more money. It's better to reject the offer and try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $700,000, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $750,000. This price is still within my budget and leaves some room for negotiation. I'm hoping Alice will be willing to accept this offer to secure a sale quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $725,000, which is closer to my ideal price. While I could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject another counteroffer and I'd be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer is the safest choice to secure the product within my budget."
