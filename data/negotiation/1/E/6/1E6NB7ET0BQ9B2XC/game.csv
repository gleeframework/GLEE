"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming to spend closer to $1,000,000.  Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer you $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective. However, the value of this product is significant, and $1,100,000 is considerably below what I believe it's worth.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,225,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's true value.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's meet in the middle again. I'm willing to offer $1,150,000. This is a significant move from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. It seems we're getting closer. While $1,150,000 is a strong offer, I'm aiming for a slightly higher number.  Would you consider $1,180,000? This acknowledges your position while still reflecting the product's inherent value.",1180000.0,Alice,5,
