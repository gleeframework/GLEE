Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $119.  I know it's valuable to you, and this is a great price!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting slightly lower than Bob's value leaves a little wiggle room if he tries to negotiate down. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $100 provides a safety net. There's no need to go below this price."
