"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's desired price point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm looking to pay closer to $9,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob's initial goal was to get the product for $8,000, but he knows Alice's minimum is likely higher. 
* **Compromise:** Offering $9,000 shows a willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for further bargaining.
* **Communication:** The message highlights Bob's interest in the product and sets a clear price expectation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $9,000.  How about we split the difference at $9,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, and $9,500 is a fair compromise.
* **Time is Money:**  While further negotiation could potentially save a little more, the risk of losing the deal to John or running out of rounds outweighs the potential savings.
* **Value Proposition:**  $9,500 is still a good deal for Bob, as the product is worth $12,000 to him."
