{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $145. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 145}

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, but still within a range that might be attractive to Bob. I'm also including a friendly message to encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is above Bob's perceived value, it's still below my minimum.  I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $130 is too low for me. How about $140? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worth my while."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $137 is a more reasonable price. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $137. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $137
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $137 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to move further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $137 is still just a little too low.  Let's meet in the middle at $139. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 139}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $136 is a more reasonable price. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $136. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $136
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're running out of rounds, and the offers from Bob are getting closer to my minimum, but they are still below it. With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of failing to reach a deal and ending up with nothing is too high.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $150 from John."
