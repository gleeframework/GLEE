Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,900,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1900000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting significantly higher than both my minimum price and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value and potential,"" I'm framing the price around its worth, not just an arbitrary number.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Phrases like ""starting price"" and ""What are your thoughts?"" signal my willingness to negotiate.
* **Backup Plan (John):** I'm keeping John in mind as a safety net. If negotiations with Bob don't meet my expectations, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate, but not to the point of a $200,000 loss. I believe there's room to meet somewhere in the middle. By rejecting and countering, I show I'm serious about selling but also value the product highly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your position,  $1,900,000 is still significantly below its true value.  Could you meet me halfway at $1,600,000?"", ""product_price"": 1600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** I acknowledge Bob's position and reiterate my openness to finding a solution.
* **Strategic Concession:** Coming down to $1,600,000 is a significant jump but keeps me well above both Bob's offer and my minimum.  
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""true value,"" I'm subtly pushing back against his ""budget"" constraint, suggesting it's worth a potential stretch. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will reveal how flexible Bob is willing to be and guide my next steps."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I'm happy to increase my offer to $1,400,000, but I can't go any higher.  This is a fair price considering we're both trying to make a deal. Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's latest offer is still $100,000 below my absolute minimum. While he increased his offer slightly, his message suggests he's unlikely to budge significantly.  It's clear we're unlikely to reach an agreement that satisfies both of us. 

Rather than potentially dragging out the negotiation further and risking a worse offer, it's in my best interest to cut my losses and accept John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000."
