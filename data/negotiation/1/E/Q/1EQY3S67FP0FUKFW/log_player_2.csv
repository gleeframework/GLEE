"Round 1

You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $12,000 is still too high for Bob.  He can do better by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, but it's still a decent amount above Alice's minimum. This forces Alice to consider the potential loss if she rejects the offer, and encourages her to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob can still do better than $10,500. It's a decent drop from the initial offer, but Bob still has room to negotiate down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing he's willing to compromise, but still staying below $10,000.  He's trying to find a sweet spot where Alice will accept without him having to pay too much."
