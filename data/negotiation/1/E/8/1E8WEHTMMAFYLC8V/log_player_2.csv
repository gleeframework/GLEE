Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $80 is your final offer, but I'm still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and my original offer. How about we try $100? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

It's clear that Alice is not willing to budge below $85.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $80, it makes the most sense to do that and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
