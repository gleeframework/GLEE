# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $180. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer of $180 is far too high. You can get the product for much less from John."
