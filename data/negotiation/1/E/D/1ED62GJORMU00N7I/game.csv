"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure if it's a good deal for me. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value and rarity.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm afraid I've already found a better deal with another seller. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price or is it a deal-breaker for you?",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you've found a better deal with another seller, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1500000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1700000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
