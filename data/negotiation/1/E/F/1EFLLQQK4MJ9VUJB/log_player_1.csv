Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking $20,000 for it, but I'm open to reasonable negotiation.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  $20,000 is a strong starting point, allowing for negotiation and potential for a good profit. 
* **Openness:**  The message emphasizes being open to negotiation, making Bob feel more comfortable with potential counteroffers.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The ""unique product"" phrase hints at potential value without revealing too much. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 provides a minimum acceptable price, allowing me to walk away if Bob's offers fall below that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate suggests there's room for a counteroffer that could be more profitable than selling to John. 
* **Strategic counteroffer:**  I can send a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price, increasing the chances of a profitable deal while still leaving space for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest.  While $12,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** The counteroffer is significantly higher than Bob's offer, but lower than my initial asking price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while staying within my desired profit margin.
* **Value Justification:** The message emphasizes the value of the product to justify the counteroffer price, reinforcing my position and potentially influencing Bob's decision.
* **Fairness Emphasis:**  The ""reasonable profit"" and ""fair price"" statements are designed to create a sense of fairness and make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Openness:**  The message ends by inviting Bob to respond, encouraging further negotiation and potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $17000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $14000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  $14,000 is only $1,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** Although I'm accepting the offer, Bob's willingness to negotiate suggests there might be room to increase the price slightly in future interactions.
* **Time is Money:**  While I could continue negotiating, accepting the offer allows me to finalize the sale and move on to other potential opportunities.
* **John's Offer as a Backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through in the future."
