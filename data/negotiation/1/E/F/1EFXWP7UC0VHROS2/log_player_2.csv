 It's too expensive for Bob's budget. He will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

Bob wants to start the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This will hopefully prompt Alice to compromise and make a counteroffer closer to Bob's target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is willing to accept Alice's offer of $145. This is a good compromise as it's within his budget and less than buying from John."
