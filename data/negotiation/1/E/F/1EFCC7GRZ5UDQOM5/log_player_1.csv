{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $10,000 is still higher than the $8,000 Bob is willing to pay, giving you room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum value:**  $10,000 is lower than your minimum of $12,000, allowing for potential compromises. 
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  It's a clear signal that you are serious about selling the product, but you're not desperate.

By starting at $10,000, you create an opportunity for Bob to counteroffer, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price. If Bob rejects, you can always fall back on John's offer of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm not desperate to sell. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Maintain leverage:**  Rejecting shows I'm not willing to settle for the first counteroffer.
* **Explore better options:**  I can try to get closer to my desired price in the next round.
* **Avoid regret:**  Selling for $9,000 now might make me regret not trying to get a better price later.

By rejecting, I can:

* **Counteroffer with a price slightly higher than $9,000.** 
* **See if Bob is willing to compromise further.**

If Bob won't budge, I can always sell to John for $12,000, ensuring a better outcome for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I understand you're trying to stay within your budget. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by moving halfway between my previous offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. 
* **Maintain Value:**  $9,500 is still closer to my ideal price than Bob's offer,  making it a more desirable outcome for me.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm highlighting the fairness and value of the offer for both of us, fostering a sense of cooperation.

This counteroffer shows willingness to negotiate but also maintains my leverage. It allows Bob to make a final decision without giving too much ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $9,200? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I really need to stay within my limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,200 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with it. Here's why:

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential gain from further negotiation is minimal. The difference between $9,200 and $12,000 is significant enough to make the risk of further negotiation not worth it.
* **Time & Effort:**  Continuing the negotiation will take more time and effort, with no guarantee of a better outcome. 
* **Guaranteed Value:**  Selling to John for $12,000 is a guaranteed, safe option that meets my minimum requirement.

Selling to John ensures a satisfactory outcome, minimizing risk and maximizing my earnings.  It's time to move on to a guaranteed deal."
