"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Optimism:**  I'm hoping to capitalize on Bob's potential interest and push him towards a higher price. 
* **Keeping Options Open:**  I'm not immediately going for the $15,000 John is offering, as I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a little high for me right now. Would you be willing to consider $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $5,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even significantly lower than the $8,000 Bob values the product at. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  Bob's counteroffer shows he's interested in the product, and I believe there's room for a more reasonable negotiation. 
* **Avoiding John:**  Selling to John is always an option, but I want to explore if I can get a better deal from Bob before I settle for the guaranteed $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is just too low.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let's find a solution that works for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by reducing my price from $12,000 to $9,000, but still staying significantly above Bob's offer.
* **Emphasize Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we meet in the middle at $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob is moving closer to my minimum price, $7,000 is still below my desired outcome.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  Bob seems willing to negotiate further, and I believe I can get a better price than $7,000.
* **Keeping John in Reserve:**  I'm not ready to settle for $7,000 yet, as selling to John for $15,000 is always a safe option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $7,000 is closer, it's still a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $8,500.  This price is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** I'm continuing to reduce my price, but still staying above Bob's offer, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Fair Compromise:** I'm framing $8,500 as a ""fair compromise,"" suggesting it's a reasonable midpoint.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation positive."
