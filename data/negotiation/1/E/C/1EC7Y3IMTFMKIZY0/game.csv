"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a little high for me right now. Would you be willing to consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is just too low.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let's find a solution that works for both of us!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we meet in the middle at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $7,000 is closer, it's still a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $8,500.  This price is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,5,
