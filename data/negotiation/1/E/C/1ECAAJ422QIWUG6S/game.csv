"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $200 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm interested in the product, but I'd only be able to pay $140 for it.  Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $140 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $170?",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $170 is still a little too high for me.  I'm happy to go up to $155.  That's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good price for both of us.",155.0,Bob,4,
