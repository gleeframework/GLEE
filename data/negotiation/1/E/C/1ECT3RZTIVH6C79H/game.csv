"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the product's potential and my budget. I hope you'll consider this counteroffer.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which still allows me to make a good profit while offering you a fair price. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both parties.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints. Let's try to find a solution. I'm willing to go down to $1,275,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to achieve our goals. Please consider this final offer.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
