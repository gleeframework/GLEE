"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $18,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $14,500?",14500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $14,500 is lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about we split the difference and go with $16,250? This would still be a good deal for both of us.",16250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $16,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you meet me at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
