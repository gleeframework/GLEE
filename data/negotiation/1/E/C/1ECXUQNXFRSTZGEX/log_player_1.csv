"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1150000} 

I'm starting with a relatively high price, but still below what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still confident that I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, showing I'm willing to negotiate.  $1,125,000 is still a good price for me, and hopefully close enough to Bob's offer to encourage a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is the same as his last one.  While I'd prefer a little more, it's getting late in the game, and I'm guaranteed a good profit.  Accepting his offer is the best choice at this point."
