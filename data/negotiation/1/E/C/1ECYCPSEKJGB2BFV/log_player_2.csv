"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While it's a good starting point, it's in my best interest to negotiate further to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This leaves room for both of us to profit, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, although it's a good sign that she's willing to negotiate. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if we can reach an agreement closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,050,000, but I'm still just a bit over my budget. To finalize this deal, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and it reflects the product's value to me while ensuring a profitable transaction for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1,030,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,030,000 is getting closer to my budget, I'm not willing to go above my limit of $1,000,000.  At this point, the negotiation is taking longer than I'd like, and it's unclear if Alice is willing to come down any further.  It's more efficient for me to simply purchase the product from John for $1,000,000 and avoid any further negotiation."
