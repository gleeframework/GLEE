"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $110 is still above his maximum price point of $100. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $110 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $95 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, aiming to test the waters and see how much Alice is willing to compromise. This is a substantial discount from Alice's offer, but it's still within Bob's acceptable range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $105. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $105, which is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $100.  While it's tempting to accept, Bob has 7 rounds left to try and negotiate a better price.  He can still potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $105, but I'm still a little over my budget. I'm willing to go up to $100. It's my maximum price point, but I think it's a fair offer."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering his final price point, $100. This is his maximum budget, so he can't go any higher.  He's hoping that Alice will accept this offer to avoid the risk of him buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 is your maximum price point, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $102.50. It's the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $102.50 is still above Bob's maximum budget.  He has only 5 rounds left to negotiate, and it's highly unlikely he will be able to get Alice to go lower than $100. To ensure he gets the product within his budget and avoids further negotiation,  Bob should choose to buy from John."
