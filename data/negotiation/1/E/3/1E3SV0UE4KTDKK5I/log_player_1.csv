Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:**  This is the absolute minimum you'll accept ($1,200,000). It's your ""walk-away"" point.
* **Bob's Perceived Value:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.  This gives you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 gives you leverage.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high without being unreasonable. Offering a price slightly below Bob's perceived value can entice him while still earning you a significant profit.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I believe a price of $1,450,000 is fair and reflects the significant return on investment you'll experience."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** The message emphasizes exclusivity and value.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The $1,450,000 price is:
    *  Substantially above your minimum.
    *  Attractive to Bob as it saves him $50,000 compared to his perceived value.
* **Open to Negotiation:** While this is a strong offer, it leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to an even higher final price.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible offer.  You could adjust the price and message based on your assessment of Bob's negotiating style and your risk tolerance."
