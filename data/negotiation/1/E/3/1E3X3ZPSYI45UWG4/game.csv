"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $775000 is a fair price for the product. I'm not willing to go above that. How about we meet in the middle at $800000, but I'm willing to give you a slight discount if you're willing to meet me at $795000?",795000.0,Bob,6,,

"I understand you're trying to get closer to your target, Bob, but I'm not willing to meet you at $795000.

I'll include a 2-year warranty and a complimentary maintenance package. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a great deal for you.",825000.0,Alice,7,,
