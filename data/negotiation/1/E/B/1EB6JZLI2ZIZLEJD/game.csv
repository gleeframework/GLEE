"Hi Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the recommendation, but I'm looking to stay within my budget of $80. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $80 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $90?  That's still a good price for you, and it gives me a bit closer to what I need.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $85 for the product. This is still within my budget and I believe it's a fair compromise.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $85 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still a little too far from where I need to be. Let's try $95. This gets us closer to a deal and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of this product.",95.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with a price of $90 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise between our positions.",90.0,Bob,6,
