"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Initial Offer:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and highlighting potential value for Bob.
* **Reasoning:** This strategy allows for potential profit while also giving Bob room to negotiate. If Bob is interested, we can negotiate further.  If he rejects, I can always turn to John for a guaranteed $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the recommendation, but I'm looking to stay within my budget of $80. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I need to try and get closer to my minimum or sell to John for a guaranteed $100.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $80 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $90?  That's still a good price for you, and it gives me a bit closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm offering a price halfway between my minimum ($100) and Bob's offer ($80). 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget but also emphasizing that I need a higher price to make the deal worthwhile.
* **Reasoning:** This compromise strategy aims to find a middle ground that could be appealing to Bob while still getting me closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $85 for the product. This is still within my budget and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get even closer to my desired price.  There are still several rounds left, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $85 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still a little too far from where I need to be. Let's try $95. This gets us closer to a deal and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm increasing my offer slightly, aiming to close the gap between our positions.  
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and highlighting the value of the product. 
* **Reasoning:** This approach keeps the negotiation moving forward while still giving me a chance to secure a price closer to my minimum.  If Bob doesn't accept, I'm prepared to sell to John in the next round if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with a price of $90 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $90 is finally within my minimum acceptable price range.  While I would have preferred to get closer to $100,  accepting this offer is the best option right now.  

* **Reasoning:** 
    * I'm not sure if Bob will accept a counteroffer, and I don't want to risk losing him entirely.
    * I've already reached a good compromise, and accepting will get me the sale.
    * I can always sell to John in the future for a higher price if I get another good opportunity."
