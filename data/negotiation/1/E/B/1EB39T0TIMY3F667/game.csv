"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $2000000. I believe it's a fair price considering its exceptional quality and features. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $2000000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $1000000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1000000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1500000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1500000, but I'm still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $1250000.  This is my final offer.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but $1250000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so I'm counteroffering $1375000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
