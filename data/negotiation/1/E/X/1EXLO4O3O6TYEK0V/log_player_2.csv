"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $9,000 is more than Bob is willing to pay, and he has other options.  He can either counteroffer Alice or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $7,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,250?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his ideal price, he can still get the product for less from John. It's worth seeing if he can negotiate further with Alice before making the final decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $8,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is the price I can get elsewhere.  Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 8000}
