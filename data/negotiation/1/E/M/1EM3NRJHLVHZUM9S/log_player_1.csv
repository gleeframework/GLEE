Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Target Price:** I'm aiming for a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested but not willing to pay the full amount.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  While I could go higher, I don't want to risk Bob immediately rejecting the offer and losing out on a potentially better deal.
* **John as Backup:**  Having John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000 provides a safety net if Bob doesn't accept. 

This strategy balances maximizing potential profit with ensuring a reasonable chance of a successful sale."
