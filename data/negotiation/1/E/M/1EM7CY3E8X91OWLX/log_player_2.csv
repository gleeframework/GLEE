"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $11,500. It's worth a lot more to you, and I'm confident you'll find it highly valuable.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,500 is less than your maximum budget, there's a chance to get a better price. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to propose a lower amount, bringing you closer to the $10,000 value she places on it.  You can always buy from John for $12,000 if needed."
