Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $650,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to reach a compromise, but $750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it. What do you think?
