"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to showcase this product. It's truly one-of-a-kind and I believe it will be highly valuable to you. I'm initially offering it at $1,300,000."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's a common negotiation tactic to begin with an offer higher than your desired selling price. This provides room for negotiation and potentially anchors Bob's perception of the product's value. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** While I know the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, starting significantly above his valuation might make him more willing to counter-offer within a range that's still highly profitable for me. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  The presence of John, who's willing to pay $1,000,000,  gives me a strong fallback position. I don't need to be overly aggressive in the early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, my budget allows me to pay up to $900,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob's counter-offer of $900,000 indicates he values the product more than his initial statement of $800,000. This suggests there's room for him to go higher. 
* **Profit Margin:** While $900,000 is a significant profit, accepting immediately leaves potential money on the table. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Rejecting keeps the negotiation alive, allowing me to gauge Bob's willingness to move closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer. I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value to your operations.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Downward Movement:**  I'm significantly lowering my initial asking price to signal flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  The new price of $1,150,000 is still substantially above Bob's offer but leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Goal Focus:** My goal is to maximize profit. By not immediately dropping to a price closer to Bob's offer, I'm aiming to see how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. Considering the product's unique features and my financial constraints, I am willing to pay up to $1,050,000 for it. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is a significant increase from his previous offer and exceeds my guaranteed sale price with John.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While I might be able to push for slightly more in subsequent rounds, the risk of Bob walking away increases.  
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now provides immediate returns."
