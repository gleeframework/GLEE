"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product I believe you'd be very interested in. It's a unique opportunity, and while I'm sure you understand the value it holds for you, I'm offering it to you at a special price of $1,100,000.  This is a significant discount considering the value it holds for me, and I'm confident it will be a strong asset for your business. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her value for the product, it's still higher than your maximum budget. You can get the same product from John for $1,000,000, which is a better deal."
