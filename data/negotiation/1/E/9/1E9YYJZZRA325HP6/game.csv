"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is considerably higher than your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but not to that extent. How about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle on $1,250,000? This reflects my bottom line.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
