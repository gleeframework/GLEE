"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11,000.  I'm still a bit too high though.  How about $10,500? That's a good middle ground for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm offering the product to you for $11,250. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm not willing to go any lower than this, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",11250.0,Alice,5,
