"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering the product to you for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

You can do better than $12,000. It's worth rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

You're still better off trying to get a lower price from Alice.  $11,000 is still too high. Let's make another counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11,000.  I'm still a bit too high though.  How about $10,500? That's a good middle ground for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm offering the product to you for $11,250. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm not willing to go any lower than this, so I hope we can come to an agreement.

At this point, Alice is unwilling to go lower than $11,250, which is still higher than your desired price point.  You're getting closer, but it's starting to get a bit too time-consuming.  It's better to cut your losses and buy from John for $15,000 to guarantee a deal."
