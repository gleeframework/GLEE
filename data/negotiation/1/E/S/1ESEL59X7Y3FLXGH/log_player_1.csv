I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,500. This is a fair price considering it's worth $12,000 to him and $15,000 to me.  It gives him a good deal and allows me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. While $13,500 is better than his initial offer, it's still below my desired price point. I believe I can get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $14,000. This is a compromise, meeting halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping this shows flexibility and makes it easier for us to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my desired price point. John is willing to pay my full asking price, and I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially miss out on this opportunity."
