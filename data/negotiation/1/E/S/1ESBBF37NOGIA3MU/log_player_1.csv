"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is seriously interested and if he's willing to pay a premium. 

I'm not sure what the product is worth to Bob, but I know it's worth at least $15,000 to me.  So, I'm leaving room for negotiation, but I'm also trying to get a good price early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $18,000 is a good price, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'm not yet ready to settle for less.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}
```

I'm offering $19,000. It's a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still trying to get a higher price than his offer.  This keeps the pressure on Bob to move closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price. I'm not ready to settle for less than $18,000 yet, and I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to offer $18,500. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer and shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still pushing for a higher price.  It's a good compromise point, and hopefully, Bob will see that I'm serious about getting a fair price."

{""product_price"": 17500}

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer.  We're getting close to my minimum, but I want to see if I can squeeze out a little more.  I'm going to counteroffer one more time and see if he'll budge.  If he doesn't, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16750}

I'm going to sell to John. Bob has shown he's unwilling to budge much further, and I'm not willing to go lower than $15,000.  John's offer is the best option for me at this point."
