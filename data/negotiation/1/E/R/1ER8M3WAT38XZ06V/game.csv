"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, but $800,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Let's start with $700,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,2,
