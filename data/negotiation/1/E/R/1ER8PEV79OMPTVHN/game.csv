"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,050,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's find a compromise here.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference and agree on $1,075,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence.  However, I'm still not quite comfortable with $1,075,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,087,500? It's a fair compromise and allows us to close the deal quickly.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
