"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you to get a valuable asset at a great price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts high, reflecting the value of the product to me.  It also leaves room for negotiation, as Bob's value for the product is lower. This is a strategic move to maximize my potential earnings while also leaving the door open for a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is simply out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000).  Since I have 10 rounds and the option to sell to John, I'm not under pressure to accept this offer.  It's better to continue negotiating and try to reach a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant concession from my initial offer, while still being above my minimum acceptable price. It demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.  This strategy aims to keep Bob engaged while maximizing my profit potential."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to get closer to your asking price, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied with the offer. I believe there's still room for negotiation and I'm not yet willing to settle for a price below $1,000,000. I have the option to sell to John for a higher price, so I can afford to be patient and keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  I believe this is a good opportunity for you to get a valuable product at a price that's still within your budget."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues the negotiation process while still keeping my minimum price in mind. By offering $950,000, I show a willingness to compromise and make it clear that I'm looking for a fair deal. This also increases the pressure on Bob, as he knows he's getting closer to my minimum. The message reinforces the value of the product and emphasizes the opportunity for both of us to benefit from the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to offer $925,000. This represents a significant investment on my part, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $925,000 is getting close to my minimum price, I'm still holding out for a slightly better deal. I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, so I don't feel the pressure to accept this offer just yet. By rejecting this offer, I can continue negotiating with Bob and potentially get a price closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to make one final concession.  I'm offering the product for $940,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a reasonable cost. I believe this is a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 940000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to reach an agreement.  It's a small step down from my previous offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price.

This approach aims to secure a deal with Bob while maximizing my profit potential."
