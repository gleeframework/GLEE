"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground there.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of meeting you halfway and offering the product to you for $9,250. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $9,250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's try $9,100.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away happy.",9100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,100, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of offering the product to you for $9,200. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement soon.",9200.0,Alice,5,
