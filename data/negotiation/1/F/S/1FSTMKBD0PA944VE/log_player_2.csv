"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I know it's a great deal for you, as you've expressed your willingness to pay that much. This is a one-time opportunity, as I have another buyer ready to purchase it at the same price. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to create a sense of urgency and scarcity to pressure you into accepting her offer. While you're willing to pay $10,000, there's no harm in seeing if you can get a better price.  You know John will sell it to you at $10,000, so you don't lose your fallback option by rejecting Alice's offer."
