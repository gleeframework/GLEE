"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point to see what Bob's willingness to pay is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still lower than my desired price point.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not willing to settle for a price that's too far below what I believe the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still trying to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now getting closer to my ideal price point. I'm willing to accept it and close the deal, especially since I'm not sure how much further we can negotiate. It's a good compromise for both of us."
