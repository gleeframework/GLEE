"Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer. This product is quite interesting to me, but $700,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $550,000?",550000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $650,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and potential benefits. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $650,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Would you be willing to settle at $600,000? This would be a comfortable price for me.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, but I'm still not comfortable going below $650,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $620,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my costs. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",620000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your understanding.  $620,000 is getting very close. How about we split the difference and settle at $610,000?  This would work well for me.",610000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm not willing to compromise further on the price. I've already given you a significant discount, and I'm confident that the product's value will be apparent to you once you start using it. I'm willing to meet you at $615,000, but no lower. This is my final offer.",615000.0,Alice,7,
