"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's estimated worth, but not excessively so. This gives me room to negotiate while still showing I'm aiming for a good return."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take it, I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but still aiming for a profit. This counteroffer is closer to Bob's initial offer,  making it more appealing while staying above my minimum threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, and while it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe there's room for negotiation. I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm further reducing my price to show flexibility and entice Bob. This is still above my minimum value, and I'm hoping it will be enough to secure a deal this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, and we are already halfway through the negotiations. While I'm confident I can still negotiate with Bob, the risk of not reaching a deal is getting higher.  Selling to John guarantees a good return and eliminates any further risk of losing out on the sale."
