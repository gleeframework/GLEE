"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this incredible product that I think you'll love. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm willing to part with for a price of $22000. I believe it's a steal at this price, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $22000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. I'm confident this is a fair price, considering my maximum budget and the potential value I see in this item. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $18000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11000, which is very close to my maximum budget. I hope you can understand my position and consider this final offer.",11000.0,Bob,4,
