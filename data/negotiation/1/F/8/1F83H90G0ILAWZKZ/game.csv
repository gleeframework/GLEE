"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $22,000. I believe this is a fair price considering what you'll gain from it.",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to come down to $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but $18,000 is still above my budget.  I can offer you $12,000. I believe that's a fair compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation.  $12,000 is still quite a ways off from what I had in mind.  I could be persuaded to let it go for $16,000.  This is a final offer.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $16,000 is closer, I'm afraid I can't go that high. My absolute limit is $13,000. Let me know if that works for you.",13000.0,Bob,6,
