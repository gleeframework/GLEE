"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product at a special price. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $1,400,000.  This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire a product that could be very valuable to your business. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However,  $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer.  How about $1,350,000? This price still gives you a significant benefit. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, as I said, but I'd like to go a bit lower. How about $1,320,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",1320000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $1,320,000 is closer, I'm still a bit away from my minimum.  Let's split the difference.  I'll go down to $1,335,000.  This is a fair compromise, and allows us both to move forward.  What do you think?",1335000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit away from $1,335,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,325,000, as I mentioned. I think this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point. What do you think?",1325000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob,  I understand we're close, but $1,325,000 is still a little too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need at least $1,330,000.  This is a fair price, and allows us both to come to an agreement.  What do you say?",1330000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand we're close, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,330,000. I'll meet you at $1,325,000, as I said before. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you.",1325000.0,Bob,8,
