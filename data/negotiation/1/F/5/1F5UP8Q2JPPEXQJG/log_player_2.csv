"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is less than Bob's maximum, it's still more than the product's worth to Alice. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is slightly higher than Alice's value for the product, but still significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate while still trying to secure a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $108 is closer to Bob's desired price point and within his budget.  Continuing to negotiate risks running out of rounds and having to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting the offer ensures a successful purchase while still achieving a significant discount."
