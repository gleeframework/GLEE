Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110.  It's a great deal! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:**  This gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** This ensures you'll still make a profit. 
* **It shows good faith:** By starting with a reasonable offer, you demonstrate a willingness to negotiate. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum valuation of $120.  I'm going to counter-offer Bob and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $100 to make this work.  How about we split the difference and go with $100?  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we go with $95? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum valuation, it's still not ideal.  I'm not willing to go any lower, and I don't want to risk further negotiation. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and saves me time."
