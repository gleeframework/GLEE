"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1200000. This is a fair price considering its exceptional features and benefits. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Would you consider lowering the price to $950000? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you have a limited budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a compromise at $1050000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, but still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, based on my budget constraints, I can only consider offers up to $975000. I hope this aligns better with your considerations.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $975000. I can offer you a slight discount from my previous offer, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can meet you at $1025000. This is a compromise that still allows me to cover my costs and make a profit. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've reviewed it carefully and I'm willing to consider $1000000 as a potential price point for the product. I hope this proposal works for you and allows us to move forward.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
