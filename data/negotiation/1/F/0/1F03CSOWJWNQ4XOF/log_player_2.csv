How about I offer it to you for $9,850? It's a compromise that still gives me a good profit, but also shows I'm willing to work with you.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm still not willing to go all the way to $9,500, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about I offer it to you for $9,700? It's a small concession, but I think it's a fair compromise.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","This is a tough one! Alice is clearly very good at negotiating. Let's analyze the options:

1. **Accept for $9,700:** This is a decent deal and saves you $300 compared to John. 
2. **Counteroffer:** There's a risk Alice won't budge much further, and you might end up closer to $10,000 anyway. Time is also a factor with only a few rounds left.
3. **Buy from John for $10,000:** This is your safety net, but you lose out on potential savings.

**Decision:** It's a gamble, but I think it's worth one more try to get the price down a little further.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you've been very patient and I respect that.  I'm ready to close this deal, but $9,700 is just a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $9,600 and we can finalize everything right now?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to walking away from the deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9,650, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll be happy with the product. Let's finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,650. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,650
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is signaling that this is her final offer. While we could try to squeeze out a tiny bit more in the last round, the risk of her walking away and us having to buy from John at $10,000 is too high.  Accepting at $9,650 secures a good deal and avoids the risk of overplaying our hand."
