"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $650,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $975,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the value it brings.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $975,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. To be honest, my budget caps out around $800,000. If you're willing to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today.  If not, I might need to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,
