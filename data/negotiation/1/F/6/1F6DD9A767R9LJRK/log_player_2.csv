# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! However, $7,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can offer it to you for $8,500. It's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to go below $8,000. She's consistently trying to meet in the middle, and her offers are still above your maximum budget. Buying from John guarantees you get the product at your target price."
