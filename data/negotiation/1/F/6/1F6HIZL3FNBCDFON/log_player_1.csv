Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This offer is above Bob's valuation but below your minimum acceptable price. It leaves room for negotiation but shows you're serious about selling. It's a good starting point to see if Bob is interested in making a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While it's tempting to accept since it's closer to your minimum, it's better to keep negotiating and see if you can get closer to your desired price. 

You can potentially make a counteroffer closer to your preferred price, and there's a chance Bob will accept.  It's worth exploring that option before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's lower than your initial offer of $1,150,000 but still higher than Bob's offer of $1,050,000. It shows you're willing to negotiate but also that you're not willing to give away too much.  This is a good strategy to keep the negotiation going and try to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While you could continue to negotiate, the gains are likely to be small. Given that John is willing to pay your minimum, selling to John is the most rational choice.  It guarantees you the best possible outcome for the product."
