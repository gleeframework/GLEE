"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting offer is way above your budget. You should definitely reject and make a counteroffer to try and negotiate a better price.  Buying from John immediately is possible, but you might be able to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product! Unfortunately, $120 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start Low:**  Offering $60 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it gives you room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite and Open to Negotiation:** The message is friendly and expresses interest while making it clear that the initial price is not feasible.

This strategy aims to gauge Alice's flexibility and potentially secure a deal significantly below your $80 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but $90 is still above your ideal price and your maximum budget. There's room to negotiate, especially since you have the $80 option from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for working with me, Alice. I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about meeting in the middle at $75?"", 
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer aims to split the difference between Alice's latest offer ($90) and your previous offer ($60). It signals a willingness to compromise.
* **Staying Below Budget:**  $75 keeps you comfortably below your $80 maximum and leaves a little room for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Direct and Actionable:** The message is clear, concise, and encourages Alice to respond with a decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can do $82.50, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is barely budging, and her latest offer ($82.50) is now above your maximum budget of $80.  It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and you have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $80. It's time to cut your losses and take the sure thing."
