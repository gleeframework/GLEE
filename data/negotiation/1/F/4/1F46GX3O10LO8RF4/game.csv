"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but my budget is quite limited. I would like to propose a price of $950000 to purchase the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. While I respect your desire to maintain a profit margin, I believe we can find a common ground. I am willing to offer $1100000 for the product. This proposal aims to be fair to both parties while respecting my budget constraints.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're having a productive conversation. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1100000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my initial ask. How about we meet in the middle at $1250000?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I've considered your latest proposal, Alice, and I'm willing to increase my offer to $1150000. This amount still allows me to stay within my budget while acknowledging the value of the product. I hope this revised offer meets your needs.",1150000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm glad we're continuing to negotiate. However, I'm still not quite there on the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $1200000? I'm willing to sell it to you at the same price I was initially willing to sell it to John.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm willing to consider your latest offer of $1200000, but I still feel that it's slightly beyond my budget.

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get as close as possible to your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer.
