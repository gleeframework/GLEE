{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and this is a competitive price considering its worth."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $15,000, meaning he would be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $8,000 from John, so you shouldn't sell for less.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $14,000 gives Bob a potential saving of $1,000, making it an attractive deal while maximizing your profit.

This strategy aims to secure a sale price significantly above your minimum while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain from the transaction."
