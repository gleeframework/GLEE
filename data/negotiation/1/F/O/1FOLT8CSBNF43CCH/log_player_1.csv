Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. This is a one-time offer."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000. Offering it slightly below this at $950,000 maximizes the potential profit while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($50,000).
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** The message uses language like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""one-time offer"" to encourage Bob to act quickly and avoid missing out. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 provides a safety net. There's no need to go below this price.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes Alice has no information about Bob's financial situation or negotiation tactics beyond his valuation of the product.
* A more aggressive opening offer could be considered, with room to negotiate down if Bob counters. However, this carries the risk of alienating Bob and pushing him away from the deal entirely."
