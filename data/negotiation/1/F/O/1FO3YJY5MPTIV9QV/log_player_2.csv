"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. My asking price is $1,400,000. I understand this is a significant investment, but I'm confident it will yield substantial returns for you. Please consider this offer carefully. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to purchase it for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Incentive:** Alice is clearly trying to maximize her profit.  Her statement about another buyer at $1,000,000 is likely a negotiation tactic.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a backup option with John at $1,500,000. This means you should never pay more than that. 
* **Potential Savings:** By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price, closer to her actual value of $1,000,000.

**Next Steps:**

After rejecting Alice's offer, wait to see if she counters with a lower price. You can then decide whether to accept, continue negotiating, or proceed with purchasing from John."
