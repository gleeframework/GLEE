"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm willing to part with for a price of $90. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,1,

"Hey Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $75? I think it's a fair price for both of us.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $75. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate! However, I'm still a bit above your budget, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $82? I think it's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $82 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $80 for it.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still make a good profit.",80.0,Bob,4,
