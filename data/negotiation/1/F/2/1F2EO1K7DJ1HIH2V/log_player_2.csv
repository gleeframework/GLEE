You have three options:

Alice's offer is quite high. It makes sense to negotiate for a lower price, aiming for something closer to $8,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a significant discount from my initial price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you say?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is coming closer to your acceptable price, but there's still room for negotiation. You're willing to go up to $8,000, and she's come down to $8,500. A counteroffer might bridge the gap."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $7,750 is still too low.  Let's split the difference and go with $8,250.  That's my final offer. If you don't accept, I'll have to move on to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:

Alice seems firm at $8,250, and while it's a decent price, you have a guaranteed option with John at $8,000.  It's not worth the risk of further negotiation with Alice potentially failing."
