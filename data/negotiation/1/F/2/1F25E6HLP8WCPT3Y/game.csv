"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This still leaves a good margin for you, and it's a fair price given the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,500. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
