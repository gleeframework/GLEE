{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum desired price, but still below Bob's maximum value. This leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a reason to consider your offer seriously.  

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum desired price of $12,000.  While it's tempting to accept his offer given the risk of losing the deal completely, I'm going to try to get a better price. I'll counter with a higher offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This still leaves a good margin for you, and it's a fair price given the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,500. I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum desired price of $12,000 and within a reasonable range of my initial offer.  While I could try to push for a higher price, I risk losing the deal altogether.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
