"Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm aiming to stay under $9,000.  Would you be willing to consider $8,800? I believe this price reflects the value of the product to me while still allowing you a fair profit.",8800.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. While we appreciate your offer, we would like to propose a price closer to our original suggestion. We believe $9,000 would be a fair compromise between the value you see in the product and our desired profit margin. Please let us know if this is acceptable.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still hoping to secure the product for a bit less than $9,000.  Would you be open to a price of $8,900? This would allow us to both close the deal and feel confident in the agreement.",8900.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thank you for your continued interest in our product. We understand your budget constraints and would like to accommodate you within reason. We are willing to lower our price to $8,950.
