Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, the $14,000 offer leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down a little, still landing you a great deal.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a secure offer from John at $12,000, so you're not desperate. This allows you to confidently aim high with Bob."
