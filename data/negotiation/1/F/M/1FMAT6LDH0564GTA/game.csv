"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm happy to make you a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. This is a great price, considering the value it will bring to your business.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $9000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $8500?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident I can make good use of the product.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $8500 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8750. This is still a great deal, considering the value the product will bring to your business.",8750.0,Alice,3,
