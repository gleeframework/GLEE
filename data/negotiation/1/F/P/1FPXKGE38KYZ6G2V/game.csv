"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a living, and I need to sell this product for at least $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $10,500 is closer, but I'm trying to stick to a tight budget.  Would you do $9,500?  Otherwise, I might have to consider other options.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stick to a budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get at least $10,250 for the product. I'm thinking we can find a mutually beneficial price. How about we try $10,250?",10250.0,Alice,5,
