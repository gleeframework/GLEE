"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you value the product at $100 and Alice is offering it for $90, it's worth negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $90 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be happy to pay $85. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try 87.50? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $87.50 is a good compromise.  It's still a bit higher than your ideal price of $85, but it's lower than John's $100, and it avoids further negotiation."
