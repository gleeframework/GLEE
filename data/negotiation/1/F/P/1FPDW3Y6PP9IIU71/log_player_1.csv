Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $19,000.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since the product is worth $10,000 to both you and Bob, and you have a guaranteed buyer at that price, you have room to negotiate. Starting high allows for potential negotiation downwards while still ensuring a profit.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer is designed to gauge Bob's interest level and willingness to pay. His response will inform your next move in the negotiation. 
* **Alternative Option:** You haven't revealed your guaranteed sale to John, keeping that as leverage if Bob counters or rejects your offer.

It's important to note that this is just an opening offer.  You are prepared to negotiate if Bob rejects this initial price."
