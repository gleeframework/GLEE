"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm aiming to sell it for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, though.  I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a relatively low counteroffer of $12,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This is a strategic move to establish a starting point for negotiations and to see how willing Alice is to come down on her price.  He also expresses interest in the product to keep the negotiation going."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I was hoping for. Could you meet me somewhere in the middle, say around $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $17,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his maximum of $15,000. Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price and might be able to get a better deal if he continues to reject offers. It's important to remember that Bob has the option to buy from John for $15,000 at any time, so there's no need to rush into accepting an offer that's not ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  I understand you're looking for $17,000, but I'm still only able to go up to $14,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's  closer to my budget and still leaves you with a decent profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to inch up his offer, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate while staying within his budget.  He's also using a persuasive message, highlighting that his offer is ""fair"" and ""a decent profit"" for Alice.  This approach aims to convince Alice to accept the offer and avoid the need to go to John."
