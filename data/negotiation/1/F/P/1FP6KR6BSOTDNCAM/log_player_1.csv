Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This gives Bob a good deal, as the product is worth $1,000,000 to him, while still giving me a profit. I believe this will encourage Bob to negotiate further, leading to a higher final price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,050,000. This is a compromise that's still higher than Bob's offer, but closer to his valuation. I believe this will keep the negotiation moving forward while still giving me a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  It's important to remember that I have a backup option in John, who is willing to pay my minimum. This gives me more leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm offering the product for $1,000,000. This is my absolute minimum price, and I'm confident that Bob is willing to pay it, given that the product is worth that much to him.  I'm also aware that John is willing to pay this price, so I'm not taking any unnecessary risks."
