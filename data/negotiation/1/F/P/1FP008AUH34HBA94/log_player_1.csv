Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm hoping Bob will be interested, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if he counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to sell it for that low immediately. I'll try to get a better price by countering Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm countering with $17,500.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and it shows I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping this will be agreeable to him, but I'm ready to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting very low with his offer, and I don't think I can get much more out of him. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $15,000."
