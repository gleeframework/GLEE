"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $90 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully get a price closer to my desired $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $70 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $70 is a bit too low for me. How about $85? That's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum while still being open to negotiation. $85 feels like a fair compromise given Bob's initial offer and my need to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $85 is a bit too high for me. How about $77.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $77.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $77.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $77.5 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we split the difference at $81? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 81} 
```

I'm offering a slightly lower price than my previous offer to show flexibility and willingness to compromise. $81 is still above my minimum acceptable price and closer to what I believe the product is worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit below $81. How about $78? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $78 is getting closer, I'm worried that I'm going to end up with a price lower than my minimum. Also, I'm running out of time.  I'll sell the product to John for $80.  I'm happy with that price and can move on to other potential customers."
