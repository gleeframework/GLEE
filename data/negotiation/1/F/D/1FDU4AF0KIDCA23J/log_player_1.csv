Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is more than what John is offering,  I'm confident I can get closer to my target price with some negotiation.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is still significantly below the value I'm aiming for.  Let's meet in the middle.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is tempting, I'm still confident that we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to concede a bit more, but I need to ensure I'm getting a price closer to my target.  I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing your point about budget constraints, but $950,000 is still quite a bit below where I need to be. Let's try to find a happy medium.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,000,000. How about $975,000? I think this is a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:

While $975,000 is tempting, it's still below my target price. I believe we can reach an agreement closer to $1,000,000. I'm going to counteroffer and see if Bob is willing to budge a little more."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,000,000, it's becoming clear that Bob is firm on his price.  I'm running out of rounds, and accepting his offer at $980,000 is better than losing the deal or settling for John's offer of $800,000."
