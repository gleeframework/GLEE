"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know you'll find valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than John's price, there's room for negotiation to get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you coming down to $11,000. I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is a bit tighter. Would you be willing to consider $9,500? "", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his desired price, there's still room for negotiation, and he can likely get a better price by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $10,250 is closer, but I'm still a bit stretched.  How about $9,800? That's a fair compromise, and it's the best I can do."", ""product_price"": 9800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,800 is close, but I need to get at least $10,000 for this.  That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he might be able to get a slightly lower price, Alice has made it clear that this is her final offer.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether, and buying from John would be more expensive.  $10,000 is a good price for Bob, saving him $2,000 compared to John's offer."
