"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you coming down to $11,000. I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is a bit tighter. Would you be willing to consider $9,500? ",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,250?",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $10,250 is closer, but I'm still a bit stretched.  How about $9,800? That's a fair compromise, and it's the best I can do.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,800 is close, but I need to get at least $10,000 for this.  That's my final offer.",10000.0,Alice,5,
