"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll really love. It's a unique and valuable item that I'm sure you won't find anywhere else. I'm willing to let it go for $200.",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $150?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $200 is a bit steep, but I was thinking more along the lines of $180. This is my lowest price for now, and I'm willing to negotiate further if you're still interested.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $160?,160.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $175? This is my final compromise, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",175.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $175 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $165?",165.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $170. This is my absolute minimum price, and I'm not budging further. If you're still interested, we can discuss the details of the sale.",170.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $170. Would you be willing to consider a price of $165?",165.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've already told you my minimum price is $170, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm going to have to consider other options. I'm not going to keep negotiating for free.",170.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but I'm not willing to pay $170. I'm going to have to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. I'm willing to meet you at $165, but that's as low as I can go.",165.0,Bob,10,
