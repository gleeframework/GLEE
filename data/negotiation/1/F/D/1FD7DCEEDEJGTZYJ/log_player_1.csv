Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $80. This gives me room to negotiate if he rejects my initial offer.  I'm aiming for the highest possible price, but I'm willing to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering $95 as a counteroffer. It's a significant reduction from my initial price, but it's still above Bob's offer and closer to my desired price point. I'm hoping this compromise will be acceptable to him and we can finalize the sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John. Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price point, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  John is offering me a guaranteed $100, which is a better outcome for me.  While I'd prefer to maximize my profits,  I'm prioritizing a secure sale over potentially further negotiating with Bob."
