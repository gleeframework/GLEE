Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $850000, which is still a significant profit for you, and a fair price considering my maximum budget. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
