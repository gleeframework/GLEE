Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum acceptable price:** I need to earn at least $1,000,000 to make the sale worthwhile.
* **Potential upside:**  I'm aiming for a significant profit beyond my minimum. A price of $1,500,000 represents a 50% profit over my guaranteed minimum.
* **Risk/Reward:**  By offering a higher price, I'm taking a chance that Bob might reject it. However, the potential reward of a larger profit outweighs the risk in my view.

This offer allows me to maximize my potential earnings while still being within a reasonable range that Bob might consider."
