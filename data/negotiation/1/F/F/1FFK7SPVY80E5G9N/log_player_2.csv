"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. I know you're interested and I'm confident it can significantly benefit your operations.  I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000, which is a fair price considering its potential. Let me know your thoughts. If it's not a good fit for you, I have another buyer who is ready to purchase it at a lower price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is below your maximum budget, it's still more than you need to pay. John offers the product for $1,500,000, but there's a chance you could get a better deal from Alice if you reject her initial offer. She mentions another buyer at a lower price, suggesting room for negotiation."
