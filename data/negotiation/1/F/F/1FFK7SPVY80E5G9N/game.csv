"Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. I know you're interested and I'm confident it can significantly benefit your operations.  I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000, which is a fair price considering its potential. Let me know your thoughts. If it's not a good fit for you, I have another buyer who is ready to purchase it at a lower price.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
