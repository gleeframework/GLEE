"Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $180.  Let me know what you think!",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest. While $120 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my asking price of $180. How about we meet in the middle at $150?  This would give us both a good deal.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $150 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $130, but that's my final offer. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $140. This is a significant reduction from my original offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $140 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to stick to my last offer of $130. If that doesn't work, I'm going to have to look at other options.",130.0,Bob,6,
