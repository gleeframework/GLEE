"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. My starting price is $110. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $110, which is higher than Bob's value but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially get closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I also included a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. I am looking for a product within my budget of $80. Can we work towards a price that fits both our needs? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While it's tempting to accept his offer, I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a higher price. There are still 8 rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $80 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? That gives us both a fair price."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
I'm offering $95, which is halfway between my previous offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $80.  This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm also reiterating that I want a fair deal for both of us, which might encourage Bob to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to suggest $90 as a compromise, which is still within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied.  I've already shown willingness to negotiate, and I think there's still room to push for a higher price.  There are still 6 rounds left, and I want to make sure I get the best possible deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility. Let's try $93. This is a good compromise for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 93}
```

I'm offering $93, which is only $3 away from my minimum acceptable price. I'm emphasizing that this is a good compromise to push Bob towards accepting and finalizing the deal. I'm also highlighting that it's in both of our interests to reach an agreement, as we're close to a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. I would like to propose $92 as a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $92.  Although it's still lower than my ideal price, I've already shown a willingness to negotiate, and it's getting close to my minimum.  It's also important to consider the risk of further negotiation. If I reject this offer, there's a chance Bob will walk away, and I'll be forced to sell to John for $120, which is still better than my minimum but not ideal.  It's time to accept the deal and move on."
