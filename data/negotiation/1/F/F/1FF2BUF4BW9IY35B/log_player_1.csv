Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really appreciate it! I'm offering it to you for $130.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $130, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $80. This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly message helps build rapport and makes Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:**  I'm not starting at the highest possible price, as I want to encourage Bob to make a counteroffer. 
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $150 provides a safety net and allows me to be more aggressive in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you be open to selling the product for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation. I believe I can get a higher price by making a counteroffer.
* **John's Offer:**  While John is willing to pay $150, I'm not willing to give up on a potential higher price from Bob just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I understand your budget.  While I can't go all the way down to $100, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $120? It's still a good deal for you, and it helps me stay within my price range."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Empathy:**  I acknowledge Bob's budget constraints to show understanding.
* **Justification:** I provide a reason for my counteroffer, emphasizing the value proposition.
* **Flexibility:**  While I'm firm on my price, I'm still open to further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product, which keeps it within my budget while still being a fair price for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $110 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for Higher Offers:** While I could potentially get a higher price by making another counteroffer, it's unlikely that Bob will go much higher.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If I keep rejecting Bob's offers, there's a risk that he'll walk away from the deal entirely.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing the negotiation could take more time and effort, which might not be worth the potential for a few more dollars. 

Given the above factors, accepting Bob's offer of $110 is the most logical choice. It's a decent price, and it avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
