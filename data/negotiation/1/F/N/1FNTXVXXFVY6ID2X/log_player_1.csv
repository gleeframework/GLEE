Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product that you might be interested in. I'm asking for $110 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** You're still leaving yourself room to negotiate if Bob makes a low counteroffer. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:** Bob knows exactly what you're offering. 

Remember, you can always adjust the price and message based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I'm interested, but I can only pay $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $120. You can try to get closer to your desired price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $100. That's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for adjusting your price, Alice. I appreciate it. I'd like to counter with $95 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $95 is still a bit below your desired price, it's closer to your minimum acceptable price of $120.  It's likely that Bob won't budge further, and you risk losing the deal altogether. It's a good idea to accept the offer and move forward with the sale."
