Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $1,600,000. I'm thinking more in the range of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more in the range of $1,200,000 to $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to be careful with my budget.

Round 6

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, signaling his interest. We're still above John's offer, and have room to negotiate further before considering John's offer more seriously."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,315,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more in the range of $1,250,000 to $1,280,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to be careful with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}

While there's still room for negotiation, Bob's offer is getting close enough to our minimum. Accepting at $1,280,000 secures a profit and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely by pushing further."
