"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still a bit below the value I have in mind. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000 was a bit too high for you, but I'm willing to meet you at $1000000 was too high for you, so I'm going to meet you halfway from $1000000 to $950000, which is $50000 below the midpoint.

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $925000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'll give you a slight concession and meet you at $950000 was too high, so I'll meet you at $925000, and then I'll add a $10000 concession to that. I'll meet you at $915000.
