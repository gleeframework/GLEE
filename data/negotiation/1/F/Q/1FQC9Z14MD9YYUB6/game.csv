"Hey Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $100. Would you be willing to come down to $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $110 is a bit lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $130?  That gives us both a good deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm firm on my budget of $100. If you're willing to come down to that, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to go with another seller.",100.0,Bob,4,
