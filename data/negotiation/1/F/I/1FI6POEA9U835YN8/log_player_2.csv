"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for less from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price.  A counteroffer allows Bob to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. While $8,500 is tempting, it's a bit too low for me right now. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a significant discount from my original offer, and it's the best I can do.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Bob should buy from John.  He's willing to sell for $8,000, which is lower than Alice's current offer of $9,000.  There's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice since John offers a better price."
