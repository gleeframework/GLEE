{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's an opportunity to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The price of $1,100,000 is:
    *  Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), giving us room to negotiate if needed.
    *  Attractive enough that Bob might accept it outright, considering it's a good deal below our minimum.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 

**Outcome:**

* **Best Case:** Bob accepts the offer, and we make a profit of $100,000 over our minimum.
* **Acceptable Case:** Bob negotiates, and we potentially settle on a price between $1,100,000 and $1,200,000.
* **Worst Case:** Bob rejects the offer, and we sell to John for our guaranteed $1,200,000."
