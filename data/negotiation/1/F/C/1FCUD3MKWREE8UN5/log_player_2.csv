"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above Bob's maximum price point. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can secure the product from John for a lower price of $1,000,000."
