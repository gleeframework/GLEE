"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's a good profit margin for me while still being within the range of what Bob might be willing to pay.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further, but I want to see if I can close the deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'd like to close the deal, I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $11,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but still maintaining a good profit margin. I believe this price is fair and might be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'm getting closer to my floor, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm dropping my price to $10,500. This is a significant concession, showing Bob my willingness to close the deal. It's still a reasonable profit margin for me and closer to Bob's last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're getting close, but Bob is still too far off from my minimum price.  I'm running out of rounds and I don't want to risk losing out on a sale altogether.  Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees me a good return and avoids further negotiation."
