"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm aiming for a lower price.  Given the product's value to me and the market, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $850,000 is below my acceptable range. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This recognizes the product's significant value while offering you a discount.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference -  I'll offer $875,000.  This feels like a fair compromise, considering our both our goals.",875000.0,Bob,4,
