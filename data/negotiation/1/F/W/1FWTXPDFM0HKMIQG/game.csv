"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for a product worth at least $10,000 to me.  Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to get closer to my asking price to make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more wiggle room.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,000. How about $8,750? Can you consider that?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $9,250, which is a good compromise. It's a fair price for a product worth at least $10,000 to me. Let's finalize this deal.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your asking price, but $9,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at $9,000, I'll make the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000.",9000.0,Bob,6,
