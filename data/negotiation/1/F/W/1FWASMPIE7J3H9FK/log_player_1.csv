Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $10,000, given its unique benefits."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly state why the price is above Bob's perceived value, it hints at ""unique benefits."" This provides a basis for the higher price and opens the door for Bob to counter-offer.
* **Backup Plan:**  I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000, so I'm not desperate to accept a low offer from Bob."
