Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to accept. What do you think, Bob?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $900,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $980,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is very unlikely to go below $980,000.  It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation with Alice and potentially ending up with no deal at all. Buying from John for $1,000,000 guarantees you get the product and still saves you $80,000 compared to Alice's last offer."
