"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $14,500.  It's worth at least $15,000 to you, so you'd be getting a great deal. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $14,500 isn't a terrible price, there's a chance you can get it for less from Alice.  Rejecting her offer might lead her to propose a lower price, getting you closer to your goal of saving money."
