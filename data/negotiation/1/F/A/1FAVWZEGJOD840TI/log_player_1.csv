"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $900,000, which is $100,000 above Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Highlighting value:** I mention the product's value to Bob to emphasize its worth and justify my asking price.
* **Open to negotiation:** I phrase the message in a way that invites a counteroffer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to secure a price as close to $900,000 as possible. By starting high and being prepared to negotiate, I aim to maximize my profit while still maintaining the possibility of a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle. By showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate, I hope to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. However, $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and it's a significant compromise on my part. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price that's midway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to negotiate and find common ground.
* **Reiterating value:** I emphasize the product's value to justify my price and create a sense of urgency for Bob to close the deal.
* **Emphasizing compromise:** I highlight that my offer is a compromise to encourage Bob to see it as a reasonable solution.

**Strategy:**

By taking a moderate approach and focusing on a compromise, I aim to increase the chances of securing a deal close to my desired price while still leaving room for further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $850000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $775000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has increased his offer, it is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 

**Strategy:**

I will continue to negotiate with Bob in hopes of reaching a price closer to my desired range.  Selling to John at this point would secure my minimum but limit potential gains."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $775,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $812,500.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 812500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise again:** I'm offering a price that is exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing flexibility and a desire to find a solution. 
* **Urgency and value:** I mention ""closing the deal"" to create a sense of urgency.  I also reiterate the value of the product to remind Bob why this price is reasonable.

**Strategy:**

By continually offering a compromise and emphasizing the value, I hope to nudge Bob closer to my desired price. With only five rounds remaining, I need to start closing the gap and securing a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $812500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $790000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to my desired price, but $790,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. With only four rounds left, I want to maximize my profit.

**Strategy:**

I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, aiming for a final price closer to $800,000 or higher. However, selling to John for $800,000 is becoming an increasingly attractive option as we approach the final rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $790,000 is getting closer, but I'm still holding firm on $800,000.  It's my minimum, and I believe it reflects the true value of this product for you.  Let's be realistic,  we're both very close to a mutually beneficial deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Holding Firm:** I'm sticking to my minimum price, showing that I'm serious about getting a fair deal. 
* **Emphasize Mutual Benefit:** I emphasize that we are both close to a deal that benefits both of us. This can help make the price more palatable to Bob.
* **Direct Approach:** I'm using a direct approach, leaving less room for further negotiation and encouraging a quick decision.

**Strategy:**

With only three rounds left, I'm pushing for a final decision. The risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob is increasing, but selling to John for $800,000 is a solid backup option.  I'm aiming to see if Bob will budge on his final offer."
