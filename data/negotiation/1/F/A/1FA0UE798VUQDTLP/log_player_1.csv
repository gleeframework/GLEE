Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is a significant gap from what I believe the product is worth.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,150,000? This reflects the true value while acknowledging your interest."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're still significantly below what John is offering. Bob is clearly interested and slowly moving towards our desired price point. Holding firm and countering again keeps the negotiation alive while still having the safety net of John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle this right now at $1,050,000? This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer to the end of our negotiation window and want to incentivize Bob to close the deal.  This offer is a strong compromise, still leaving us with a significant profit over John's offer while being more palatable than our previous offers.  By stating it's our final offer, we increase the pressure on Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to be flexible, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $925,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is not increasing his offers at a rate that makes continuing negotiations worthwhile.  He's still significantly below John's offer, and we're running out of rounds. Taking the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John is the safest and most profitable option at this point."
