"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low. It's worth more to me than that, and I still have more rounds to try and get a better price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, reflecting a fair value for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,150,000.  Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price in the next round. I'm confident that with a few more rounds of negotiation, I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,150,000 is simply not enough. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, let's go for $1,250,000. This price is fair for both of us and would allow us to close the deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you've been very reasonable and I appreciate that.  How about we split the difference one last time and settle at $1,200,000?  That feels like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

This is a great deal for me. I get the price I need, and I avoid the risk of potentially losing the deal by rejecting Bob's offer and continuing negotiations."
