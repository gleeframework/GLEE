Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I'm willing to compromise, $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,090,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd still prefer a bit more, I'm running out of time and  $1,085,000 is a decent deal. It's  a better outcome than selling to John for $1,000,000."
