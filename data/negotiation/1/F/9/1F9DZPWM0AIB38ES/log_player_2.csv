"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. Therefore, rejecting the offer and attempting to negotiate a lower price makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $15,000?  That's my absolute maximum."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $15000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $16500. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $18,000 to $16,500, which is a good sign. However, Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer allows Bob to continue pushing for a better price. It's likely that Alice will come down further if she wants to make a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit tight on my budget though. Would you consider $16,000? I think that's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $16000, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. I can offer it to you for $16250. This is my final compromise, and I think it's a great value for what you'll be getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $16,250, which is closer to Bob's counteroffer of $16,000. However, Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. There's a good chance Alice will come down further if Bob rejects her offer. It's worth trying to negotiate a bit more before considering the backup option of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  I really like the product, but $16,250 is still a bit more than I can manage right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $16,100? That's the absolute most I can do."", ""product_price"": 16100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really serious about this product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $16100, but I'm not quite ready to give up on getting my desired price. I can offer it to you for $16200. This is my last concession, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $16,200, which is just $200 away from Bob's last counteroffer of $16,100. While it's tempting to continue negotiating,  there are only a few rounds left.  The risk is that Alice might not budge further and Bob might end up paying more than he wants.  At this point, buying from John for $15,000 is the safer option, ensuring Bob gets the product within his budget."
