"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500.  I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects that. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You are willing to pay up to $8,000 and Alice is asking for $9,500. It's better to reject her offer and buy from John for a cheaper price."
