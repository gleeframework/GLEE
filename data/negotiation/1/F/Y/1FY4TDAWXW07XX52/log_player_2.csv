"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $1500000. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a fair starting point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  You can potentially get a better deal by negotiating.  Since you value the product at $1,500,000, there's room to negotiate down from Alice's $1,200,000 offer."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I agree it's a valuable asset, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $950,000, which is still a significant profit for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle a bit more. Considering the product's value to you is $1500000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1100000. This is still a significant discount from the original price, but I believe it reflects the product's worth. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is still higher than the price you're comfortable with.  You can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. There's still a significant gap between your offer of $950,000 and her counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try to find a price that's fair to both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This is a significant amount of money, and I believe it's a good compromise.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $1000000. Considering the product's value to you is $1500000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1050000. This is a compromise that I think reflects the product's worth and gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can finalize the sale at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a good compromise.  It's still a significant discount from the original price, and it's closer to your counteroffer of $1,000,000.  At this point, you can reasonably expect to get a better deal than what you can get from John. Continuing to negotiate might lead to a better price, but there's a risk that Alice might decide to walk away and you'd be forced to buy from John."
