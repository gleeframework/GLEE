Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I agree it's a valuable asset, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $950000, which is still a significant profit for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.
