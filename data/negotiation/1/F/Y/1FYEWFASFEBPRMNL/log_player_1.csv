"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need it to be within a reasonable budget. How about we bring the price down significantly? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'd like to close the deal,  $650,000 is far too low for me. I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  However, $650,000 is simply not a viable price for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure a reasonable return on my investment.  How about we try $1,200,000?  This is still a significant discount from the product's true value, and it allows for a mutually beneficial arrangement. Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate some. That said, we're still pretty far apart on price. To be frank, anything over a million dollars is going to be a non-starter for me.  I'm willing to offer you $850,000. This is a very serious offer, and reflects the maximum I'm able to spend. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable amount. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming to reach a compromise that benefits both of us."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 simply isn't enough for me to sell. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and your potential gains.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we're getting closer. I appreciate you moving towards a more reasonable price. While $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable amount, I believe we can still find a middle ground. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round with the goal of closing the deal at a price closer to $1,000,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer to an agreement. I appreciate your increased offer, but $900,000 is still slightly below what I need. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to drop my price to $950,000. This price acknowledges your needs and allows me to proceed with the sale. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
