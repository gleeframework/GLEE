"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,700,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price given the potential benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need it to be within a reasonable budget. How about we bring the price down significantly?"", ""product_price"": 650000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  However, $650,000 is simply not a viable price for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure a reasonable return on my investment.  How about we try $1,200,000?  This is still a significant discount from the product's true value, and it allows for a mutually beneficial arrangement. Let's see if we can find a common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate some. That said, we're still pretty far apart on price. To be frank, anything over a million dollars is going to be a non-starter for me.  I'm willing to offer you $850,000. This is a very serious offer, and reflects the maximum I'm able to spend."", ""product_price"": 850000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 simply isn't enough for me to sell. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and your potential gains.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, it seems like we're getting closer. I appreciate you moving towards a more reasonable price. While $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can finalize the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer to an agreement. I appreciate your increased offer, but $900,000 is still slightly below what I need. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to drop my price to $950,000. This price acknowledges your needs and allows me to proceed with the sale. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is coming down in price, she's unlikely to go much lower than $950,000. At this point, you're better off cutting your losses and taking the guaranteed deal from John at $800,000.  You save $150,000 and avoid the risk of the negotiation failing altogether."
