# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll love it, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to discuss further! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's starting price is significantly higher than her own valuation of the product. There's a lot of room for negotiation here."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I think $1,200,000 is a little high. I'd be willing to pay $900,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While not insulting, this counteroffer aims to anchor the negotiation closer to my target range.
* **Respectful Tone:** Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone is crucial for successful negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Maneuvering:** This offer allows for future concessions without immediately hitting my bottom line."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $900,000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but it's still above what I'm willing to pay. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a price point we can both agree on.  How about $975,000?  That feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 975000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between our previous offers, signaling a willingness to compromise.
* **Approaching Limit:**  I'm getting closer to my upper limit, but there's still a buffer before I have to consider John's offer.
* **Maintaining Positive Tone:**  Continuing to keep the conversation amicable is important for a successful negotiation."

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000. This is the highest I can go, and I think it's a great value for the product. Let me know if this works for you.
