Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a fair offer. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,250. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me.

Reason: While Alice is slowly coming down on price, it's unlikely she'll reach a price significantly better than John's $10,000 offer.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice has a risk of her not budging further, at which point I'd be stuck with her price or have wasted time. Buying from John guarantees the best price with no further hassle."
