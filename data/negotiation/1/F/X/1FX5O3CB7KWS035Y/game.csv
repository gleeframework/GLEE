"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be happy to pay $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,750? That's a fair price that's in the middle of our two most recent offers.",10750.0,Bob,4,
