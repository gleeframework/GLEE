Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to you.  I'm offering it to you for $120.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob. While $85 is close to my minimum, I'm not ready to sell it that low yet. I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest.  I can come down a little bit, but $85 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $97.50?  That seems like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 97.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $97.50 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something a bit lower. How about $90 even? That's a fair bit closer to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $90.  It's not my ideal price, but it's a good compromise and still better than selling to John for $80. I'm getting closer to my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing this sale altogether."
