"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest.  I can come down a little bit, but $85 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $97.50?  That seems like a fair compromise.",97.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $97.50 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something a bit lower. How about $90 even? That's a fair bit closer to my budget.",90.0,Bob,4,
