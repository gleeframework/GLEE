"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $95. Given its high value and quality, this is an excellent opportunity for you to acquire it at a reasonable premium compared to its worth of $100 to you. I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Buying from Alice saves you money:**  Alice's offer of $95 is lower than what you'd pay John ($100).
* **The product is worth more to you than Alice:**  You value the product at $100, and Alice is willing to sell it for $80. This means there's room for negotiation and a mutually beneficial deal.

Even though Alice's offer is a bit higher than her cost, it's still a good deal for you."
