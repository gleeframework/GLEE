Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product at a special price of $11,500. I think it would be very valuable to you, and this is a great deal."", ""product_price"": 11500} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $11,999 as possible, leaving Bob feeling like he got a deal while maximizing her own profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a safety net with John, so she can afford to start high with Bob.
* **Psychology:**  Offering a price just below $12,000 creates a sense of urgency and scarcity. It subtly suggests this is a ""take it or leave it"" deal at the best possible price."
