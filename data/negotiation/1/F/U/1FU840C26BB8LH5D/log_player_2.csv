"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I know would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still above your target price. There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given the value you place on the product, I'm willing to offer $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I'm confident in the product's value at $1,300,000, I'm open to finding a middle ground.  How about we settle at $1,225,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,225,000 is still higher than my desired price, but it's closer to my initial counteroffer and well within my budget. It's also more than what Alice is willing to sell for.  At this point, it's better to accept the offer and secure the product, rather than risk further negotiation and potentially having to pay more."
