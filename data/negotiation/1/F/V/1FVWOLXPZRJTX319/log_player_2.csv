Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, and we're confident it will meet your needs perfectly. We're looking to maximize our earnings, so we're offering it to you for $110. Please let us know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is within Bob's budget, it's not the best possible deal. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $110 is still a bit higher than my target price. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We understand your position and would like to make a proposal that benefits both of us. We are willing to sell the product for $107. This price allows us to maintain a reasonable profit while still being competitive in the market. Please let us know if this offer meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $107 is a reasonable compromise.  It's still a good deal for Bob, saving him $13 compared to buying from John, and it's likely Alice won't go much lower. Accepting this offer allows Bob to get the product and secure a decent saving."
