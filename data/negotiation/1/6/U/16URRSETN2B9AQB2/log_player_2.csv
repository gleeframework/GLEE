Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to make this deal work. This is a fair price considering the value this product will bring to your business. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm prepared to offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,050,000. It's better to buy from John for $1,000,000 and save the extra $50,000."
