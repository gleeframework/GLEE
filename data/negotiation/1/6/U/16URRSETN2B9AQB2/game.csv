"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to make this deal work. This is a fair price considering the value this product will bring to your business. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. Let me know if that works for you.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm prepared to offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
