"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  It's a great deal, considering its value to me. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Can you consider my offer?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $9,500?  That's a fair compromise, and it gives you a good deal on a valuable product.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this.  $9,250 is my final offer. It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.",9250.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,800 is simply too far below what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to make one final concession.  How about $9,000? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value, and it's the closest I can come to meeting you halfway.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",9000.0,Alice,7,
