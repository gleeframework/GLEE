{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. 

Here's why:

* **Time is running out:** This is the 9th round, and there's only one round left. 
* **Alice's price is too high:** Alice's final offer is $11,900, which is still above Bob's target of $11,250. 
* **John's price is a safe bet:**  John is offering the product for $12,000, which is within Bob's budget. Even though it's not the absolute lowest price, it guarantees Bob gets the product without risking further negotiation with Alice.

At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to secure the product with John than to risk another round with Alice and potentially end up with nothing."
