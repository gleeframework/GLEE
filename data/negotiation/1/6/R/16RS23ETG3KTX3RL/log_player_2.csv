"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a valuable item at a competitive price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $120 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you bringing this to me.  However, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'd be happy to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get closer to his target price of $80, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  Offering $85 shows Bob is serious about buying the product, but not willing to pay Alice's full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $85 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $100. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is closer to Bob's target price, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  He wants to see if he can get Alice down even further before considering buying from John.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $100, but I'm still a little hesitant.  Let's try $90.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy today if you're willing to accept it."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price but is still willing to pay a little more than John's offer. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying but is also firm on his price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $90. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm now offering the product to you for $95. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $95, which is a good price, but it's still over Bob's maximum budget of $80. At this point, Bob has two choices: risk another round of negotiation hoping for a lower price or simply buy from John for $80.  Given that Bob has only five rounds left, the risk of further negotiation is too high.  Buying from John guarantees a lower price and ensures Bob gets the product within his budget."
