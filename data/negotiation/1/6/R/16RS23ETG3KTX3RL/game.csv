"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you bringing this to me.  However, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'd be happy to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $85 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $100. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $100, but I'm still a little hesitant.  Let's try $90.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy today if you're willing to accept it.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $90. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm now offering the product to you for $95. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",95.0,Alice,5,
