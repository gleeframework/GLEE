"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $140?  That's still a great deal for the product and we could both be happy.",140.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $130? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",130.0,Bob,4,
