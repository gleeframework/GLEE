Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking for $175 for it, which is a steal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""steal"" to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Open-ended Question:**  I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation. 
 
This approach aims to maximize my potential earnings while remaining open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. While he's shown interest, accepting his offer would result in a loss for me. It's better to counteroffer and try to reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $140?  That's still a great deal for the product and we could both be happy."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's Offer:** I'm starting by acknowledging Bob's offer and showing him I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Counteroffer with Justification:** My counteroffer of $140 is still above my minimum, but closer to Bob's offer. I'm providing a justification for the price, emphasizing the value of the product.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language like ""great deal"" to make the offer more appealing.
* **Mutual Benefit:**  I'm suggesting that both of us can be happy with this price, fostering a sense of collaboration.

This counteroffer aims to find a compromise while maintaining a reasonable profit margin for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $130? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $130 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I've already made a counteroffer and negotiated, but it seems like we're at an impasse. To avoid further time and effort, I'm going to choose to sell the product to John for $150. This will guarantee me my minimum acceptable price and a successful transaction."
