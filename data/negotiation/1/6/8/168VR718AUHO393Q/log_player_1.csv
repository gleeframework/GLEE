{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price by continuing negotiations. I'm willing to go down a bit, but not that far yet."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 just isn't enough for me.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway once more. Let's try $9,125. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9125}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,800 just isn't enough for me to make this deal work. However, I'm willing to make one final compromise.  How about we settle on $9,000?

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,900, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds remaining, I need to make a decisive choice. While Bob's offer of $8,900 is close to my minimum, it's still below what I'd prefer. Given the limited time and the risk of further negotiation not yielding a better result, it's prudent to accept John's offer of $8,000. This guarantees a sale and ensures I meet my minimum price."
