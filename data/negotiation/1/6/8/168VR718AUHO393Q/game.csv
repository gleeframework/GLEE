"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. Let's make this happen!",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 just isn't enough for me.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway once more. Let's try $9,125. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you.  What do you say?",9125.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,800 just isn't enough for me to make this deal work. However, I'm willing to make one final compromise.  How about we settle on $9,000?  This price would still give you a great deal, considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal!",9000.0,Alice,7,
