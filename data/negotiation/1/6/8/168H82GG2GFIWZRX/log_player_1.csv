"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start by making an offer that is slightly higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept, which is $100. I'll offer Bob the product for:

{""product_price"": 120}

This is a reasonable price, considering that the product is worth $150 to Bob. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'm prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer is higher than my minimum price, but I'm not sure if I want to sell it to him at that price. I'll consider my options:

* Accepting Bob's offer would give me $110, which is less than the product's value to him ($150), but more than my minimum price.
* Rejecting Bob's offer would give me the opportunity to negotiate further and potentially get a better price.
* Selling the product to John would give me $100, which is my minimum price, but it's not as good as the offers I've received so far.

This offer is still below the product's value to Bob, but it's a reasonable compromise. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer or make a counteroffer that's closer to his maximum willingness to pay."
