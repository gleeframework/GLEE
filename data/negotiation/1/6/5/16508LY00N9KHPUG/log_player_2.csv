Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  $105 is still a bit below what I need to make this work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let's see if we can find a happy middle ground.

Alice has come down to $110, which is a better deal than buying from John. It's still above your target of $100, but it's a good compromise."
