"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $14,000.  It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.  I'm confident in the product's worth and believe this is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I need to hold out for a better deal.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is too far below my minimum. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $12,500, which is a compromise. This price is closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum, and I'm highlighting the value to Bob to justify the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about $11,000?  That's a fair compromise, I think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me. I'm not willing to accept anything below my minimum price of $12,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.  I'm still hopeful we can reach a deal, but I'm also aware that John is a reliable backup buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 just isn't feasible for me.  I'm willing to go down to $12,000, my absolute minimum. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you.  Let's make a deal and finalize this. "", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm making my final counteroffer at $12,000, emphasizing that it's my absolute minimum.  I'm hoping Bob will realize he's already getting a good deal and accept.  If he doesn't, I have John as a reliable option."
