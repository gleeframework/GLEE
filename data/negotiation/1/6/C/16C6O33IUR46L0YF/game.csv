"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,050,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget considerations, but $1,050,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I've given your proposal careful consideration, but unfortunately, I cannot agree to a price of $1,100,000. I'm hoping for a price closer to $1,000,000 which aligns more closely with my budget. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in between these figures?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
