Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be worth more than that to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000** is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, giving me room to negotiate, but still lower than my minimum value, ensuring a profit. 
* **The message** is friendly and encouraging, emphasizing the potential value to Bob. 

This approach aims to initiate the negotiation in a positive way, giving Bob a chance to accept the offer while leaving space for further negotiation if he declines."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin.  Selling to John for $15,000 is the most profitable option, but I'm willing to try to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a compromise closer to my target.  Rejecting his offer allows me to send a counteroffer and try to push the price higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing $13,250, which is the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise and signals that I'm serious about reaching a deal with him. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and positive, while still emphasizing the value of the product. The message focuses on finding a ""fair"" price, appealing to Bob's sense of reason. 

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between our positions, creating a more favorable negotiating position for me while still leaving room for potential further negotiation if needed."
