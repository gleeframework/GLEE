"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $12,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's closer to my ideal outcome, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm being friendly and confident, hoping to build rapport with Bob.
* **Open Ended:**  I'm not pressuring Bob for an immediate decision, giving him space to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.**  While it's closer than his initial rejection, it's not yet in my best interest to accept.
* **There are still 9 rounds left.**  This gives me the opportunity to continue negotiating with Bob and try to reach a price that's more favorable to me.
* **John is a backup option.**  If the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out, I can still sell to John, ensuring I don't lose out on any profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making a counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is still a little too low for me. Would you be willing to go up to $10,500?  Let's find a price that works for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer with a Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but also making it clear that I'm not ready to accept it. I'm proposing a compromise price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **Positive and Collaborative Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive tone and emphasizing finding a solution that works for both of us.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm still leaving some room for further negotiation, keeping the door open for a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $10,500 is closer, it's still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Could we settle at $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  
* **Plenty of Rounds Left:** We are only in round 4, giving me plenty of time to continue negotiations and potentially reach a better price.
* **John is a Safety Net:** If the negotiation doesn't work out with Bob, I have a guaranteed sale with John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm happy to keep negotiating. However, $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to go up to $10,000?  That would be a good compromise and allow me to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Firm on Minimum:** While I'm willing to compromise, I'm not going below my minimum of $8,000. This counteroffer is still below my ideal price but closer to my bottom line.
* **Focusing on Compromise:** I'm emphasizing the idea of compromise and finding a solution that works for both of us.
* **Positive and Motivational Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive tone and encouraging Bob to reach an agreement.
* **Limited Room for Further Negotiation:** This counteroffer is closer to my minimum, leaving less room for future concessions but still allowing for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer.  I could go up to $9,800, but that's really pushing my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Negotiation Continues:** With 5 rounds remaining, I have time to continue negotiating with Bob and try to reach a price that's more favorable to me.
* **John is a Backup:** If the negotiation doesn't work out, I can still sell to John for $8,000, ensuring I don't lose out on any profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within your budget, and I'm happy to continue trying to find a solution.  However, $9,800 is still not quite enough for me.  To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $9,900.  This is a fair compromise that's close to our target prices, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9900}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:**  I'm making a small concession from my previous offer, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to meet halfway.
* **Focus on Fair Compromise:** I'm highlighting that this price is a compromise that benefits both parties.
* **Positive and Solution-Oriented Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and solution-oriented tone, encouraging Bob to reach an agreement.
* **Minimizing Further Concessions:** This counteroffer is close to my minimum, leaving less room for further concessions.

**Important Note:** At this point, I'm taking a bit of a risk by getting closer to my minimum. However, with only 4 rounds remaining, I need to start closing the gap and see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
