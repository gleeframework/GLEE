Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $8,000. Considering the product's value to you is $12,000, I'd like to offer it to you for $8,500. This is a fair price, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

It seems we've reached a stalemate. Alice is unwilling to budge below $8,500, and we're running out of rounds. Accepting this offer secures a $3,500 discount from John's price, which is a reasonable outcome.  Continuing to push for a lower price might irritate Alice and risk the deal."
