"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make a smart financial decision. Can we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not at a price point that works for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time at $1,300,000 is not an option. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,320,000. Can we meet at this price?",1320000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm getting the sense that we may not be able to reach a mutually agreeable price. I'm only willing to come down to $1,330,000. This is the absolute lowest I can go. If you're not comfortable with this, I'll have to explore other options. ",1330000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to reach a mutually agreeable price, but $1,330,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,290,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal at this price.",1290000.0,Bob,6,
