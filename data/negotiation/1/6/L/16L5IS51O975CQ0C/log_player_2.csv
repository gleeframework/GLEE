"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1400000. This is a fair price considering its value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is good, but you can potentially do better.  By rejecting and making a counteroffer, you can try to negotiate a lower price.  You have room to negotiate since your maximum budget is $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a better price. Given its value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better price. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $1350000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair considering the product's value and your desired price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than her initial offer and closer to your desired price.  While you could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away or you having to buy from John for a higher price outweighs the potential benefit of a slightly lower price."
