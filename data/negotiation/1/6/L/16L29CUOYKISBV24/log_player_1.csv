Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. It's a great deal considering the value it holds.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet at $12,500? This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $11250? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price. While I'd prefer a bit more, it's a good compromise.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
