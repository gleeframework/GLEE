"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a game-changer in its field, and I know you'll find it valuable. I'm asking for $1200000 for it, which reflects its true potential. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget.  It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price.  There are still nine rounds to work with before potentially buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,200,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to quickly get closer to his desired price. He's highlighting the value for both parties, emphasizing that this is a fair starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $900000 is a good starting point, it doesn't quite reflect the full value of this product. Let's compromise.  I'm willing to lower my price to $1100000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll gain from this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than Bob's desired price point. Bob should continue negotiating and see if he can get a better price.  He has more rounds to work with and doesn't want to commit to a price that's still too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $950,000. This price is a fair reflection of the product's value and allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again offering a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but it's a compromise from his previous offer. He is demonstrating that he is willing to negotiate and find a solution that benefits both parties. This offer also leaves some room for further negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm going to drop my price to $1050000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it represents a fair price that benefits both of us. I'm confident this deal is mutually beneficial, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his maximum budget.  Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can secure a better deal. There are still five rounds remaining, and buying from John at $1,000,000 is always an option if the negotiation stalls."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you at $1,000,000. This price is fair considering the product's value and allows us both to close this deal. Let's finalize this and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering his final price point, aligning with his maximum budget and John's offer.  This is a bold move, pushing for a quick closure.  If Alice rejects, Bob can always buy from John."
