"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a game-changer in its field, and I know you'll find it valuable. I'm asking for $1,200,000 for it, which reflects its true potential. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1200000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than the product's value to me ($1,000,000) and below my desired profit margin. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a more favorable price. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is an option, but I want to maximize my earnings if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $900,000 is a good starting point, it doesn't quite reflect the full value of this product. Let's compromise.  I'm willing to lower my price to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll gain from this product."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1100000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $950000. This price is a fair reflection of the product's value and allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my desired price. I am determined to maximize my profits and see if I can get a better price with further negotiation. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is always an option, but I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm going to drop my price to $1,050,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it represents a fair price that benefits both of us. I'm confident this deal is mutually beneficial, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you at $1000000. This price is fair considering the product's value and allows us both to close this deal. Let's finalize this and move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is exactly the minimum I'm willing to accept. It meets my floor price and matches what I can get from John.  There's no need to risk losing this deal by pushing for a higher price.  I can confidently accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
