**Reasoning:**

While getting $100 from John is tempting, Bob's offer of $80 is now a reasonable compromise.  

* **Time Value:**  Continuing negotiations has a cost.  Each round takes time and effort.  There's no guarantee Bob will go higher, and we risk him walking away.
* **Profit vs. Potential Loss:** Accepting $80 is a sure profit. Rejecting and aiming higher might net more, but also risks losing the sale altogether.

At this point, the certainty of a good deal outweighs the potential for a slightly better one."
