Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price and significantly lower than what I know the product is worth to him. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for a price that's so far off. I'll counter with a more reasonable offer."
