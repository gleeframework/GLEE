"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. It's something that's highly valuable to me, and I believe it would be equally valuable to you.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,550,000, a price I think reflects its true worth. Let me know if you're interested, as I have another potential buyer who's ready to pay $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to inflate the price by mentioning another buyer. You know you have a guaranteed option with John at $1,500,000. There's no reason to pay more than what John is offering."
