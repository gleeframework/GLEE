Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is too far below my desired price.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm hoping to get a little more. I believe I can still get a better deal through further negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer, but I'm starting to get concerned. I've already made several concessions, and we're running out of time. I think I can still get a better deal by making one more counteroffer, but if it doesn't work, I might have to sell to John."
