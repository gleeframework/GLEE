"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $9000. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $9,000 is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  It's better for Bob to reject Alice's offer and buy from John for $8,000."
