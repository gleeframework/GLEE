"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While $10,500 is a fair offer, I'm still hoping for a bit more to make this work. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? That way, we both get a good deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me, though. How about we go with $10,750?  I'm confident we can both be happy with that price.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that.  Let's split the difference one last time. How about $10,875? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with this product.",10875.0,Alice,5,
