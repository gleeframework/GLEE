Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $180. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 180
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay more. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** Starting with a price of $180 offers a reasonable markup while still being potentially attractive to Bob if the product is worth $150 to him. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down. 
 
This strategy aims to balance maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
