"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the potential of this product, $1200000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1050000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. Let's try $1150000. It's a compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1150000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $1100000. This would be a fair price for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1125000, but that's as low as I can go. This is already a significant discount from my initial offer, and I need to make sure I'm covering my costs.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
