"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while remaining within my financial constraints.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe the product's value to you is higher than that, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm confident that this price will be a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $1,100,000 is still above my limit. I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product, which represents a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my serious interest in acquiring it. This price point allows for a mutually beneficial agreement and ensures a smooth transaction for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $900,000, which would be $1,000,000. I'm willing to accept this price, but I want to give you a chance to think about it. I'm not willing to go any lower, so this is my final offer at $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
