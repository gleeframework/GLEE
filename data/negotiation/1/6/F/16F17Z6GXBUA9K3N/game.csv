"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1000000, recognizing your budget constraints. This price reflects a fair compromise that allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can find a solution.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1000000, but that's still a bit higher than my maximum budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900000, which represents a significant investment on my part.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,4,
