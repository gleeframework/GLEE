Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $125 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I see you're interested, but $125 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $175?"",

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $175 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $125. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is firm at $125, and we know his valuation won't go higher. It's unlikely we'll get him much closer to our desired price.  Selling to John guarantees us our minimum acceptable price of $150."
