""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $12,000.  I believe it offers significant value, but I'm open to discussing the price further if you have any thoughts."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above my minimum ($8,000) to provide room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room:** The $12,000 offer signals that the product is valuable while still allowing space for Bob to counteroffer without feeling insulted.
* **Gauge Interest:** This first offer will help me understand how interested Bob is and how aggressively he'll negotiate. 
* **Alternative Option:**  I have John as a backup buyer, ensuring I don't have to settle for a price significantly below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12,000 is above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8,000. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob went straight to his maximum budget, which is also my minimum acceptable price.  While I could accept and get my minimum, there's potential to negotiate a slightly higher price. I'll counteroffer to explore if there's any flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  To be fair, I've already got a standing offer for that price. Could you do $9,000? I'm willing to let it go for that if we can close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint:** I'm aiming for a price that's halfway between his offer ($8,000) and my initial ask ($12,000). This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not drastically reduce my price.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning I can close the deal today, I'm subtly introducing a time constraint, which might encourage him to make a decision quickly. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** I subtly hinted that I have another offer, reinforcing the product's value without being too aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $9,000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my range. I'm really serious about buying the product if we can settle at my initial offer of $8,000. I'm ready to close the deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob hasn't budged from his initial offer, indicating he's unlikely to go any higher.
* **Time Value:** He's ready to close the deal now.  While I could counter, it's uncertain if I can get more, and a quick sale has its own value. 
* **Minimum Met:** Accepting his offer gets me my minimum acceptable price, which is the same as John's offer.  

It's not the highest price I hoped for, but it's a fair deal considering the circumstances."
