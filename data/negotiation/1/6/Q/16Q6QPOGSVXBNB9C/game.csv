"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $1,000,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to that amount? I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm happy to offer you the product for $1,050,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let me know if you're interested.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
