Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a significant discount from my initial price and a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,150,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need. I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000, which is closer to your offer and a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to $1,200,000. This matches John's offer. There's no point in further negotiation with Alice as it's unlikely she'll go any lower, and we risk her increasing the price again.  Buying from John guarantees the best price without further risk."
