"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a significant discount from my initial price and a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,150,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need. I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000, which is closer to your offer and a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
