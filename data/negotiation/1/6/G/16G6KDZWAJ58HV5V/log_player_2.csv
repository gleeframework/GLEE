"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $10,000?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $7,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. How about we meet at $9,000?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $8,500 is still a bit short of my target. I'm not willing to go much lower, but I'm willing to make a slight concession. How about we meet at $9,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

It's clear Alice is unlikely to budge much below $9,000.  Rather than risk the price going up again or running out of rounds, it's time to cut your losses and secure the product from John at your target price."
