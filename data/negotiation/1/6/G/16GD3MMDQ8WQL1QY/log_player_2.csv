"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's a good starting point, I can likely get a better price by counteroffering.  I'll aim for a price closer to my maximum value of $1,000,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking for a good value, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to my maximum value, but still higher than I want to pay.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering buying from John."
