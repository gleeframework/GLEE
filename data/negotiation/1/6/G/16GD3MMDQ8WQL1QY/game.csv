"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm going to need a lower price to make this work.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it represents a good value for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking for a good value, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,050,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident that it's a good deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
