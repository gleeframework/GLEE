"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's a price I'm comfortable with.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my initial price.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $1,050,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my own financial goals.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,050,000, so I'll offer you $975,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $975,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $990,000, which is a fair compromise for both of us.  It's very close to your offer, and it allows me to stay closer to my target price.  What do you think?",990000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that $990,000 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, which is still a bit lower than your offer. Can you consider this revised offer?",980000.0,Bob,6,
