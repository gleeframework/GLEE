# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product at her own maximum value. There's no room for negotiation to get a better price. By rejecting the offer, I can see if John (who's willing to sell at the same price) might be open to a lower price, or I can explore other options."
