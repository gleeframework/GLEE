"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $150 by myself. Considering its high quality and unique features, I believe it's worth more than what you'd find on the market. Given its value to you, I propose we strike a deal at $140. This way, you get a great product at a reasonable price, and I can ensure it goes to someone who appreciates it fully. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
