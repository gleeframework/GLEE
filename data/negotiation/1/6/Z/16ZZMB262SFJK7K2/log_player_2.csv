"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm happy to offer it to you for $115.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $115 is a decent price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $105 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $105 is a little lower than I'd hoped for, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $110? That's still a good deal for you, and a fair price for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is within Bob's budget of $120.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and potentially raising the price again exists. Accepting the offer at $110 ensures Bob gets the product at a good price, saving him $10 compared to buying from John."
