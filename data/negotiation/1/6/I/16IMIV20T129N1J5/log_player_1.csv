Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's fair:** $90 is a good middle ground between your minimum acceptable price of $80 and Bob's perceived value of $100.
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:**  The message makes it clear you're open to discussion and not just demanding the full $100. 
* **It gives Bob a reason to buy now:** By mentioning the product's suitability for him, you create a sense of urgency and potentially incentivize Bob to accept your offer rather than risk losing out. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $70 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. It's worth trying to get closer to my goal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $70 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $85? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $85 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $78? I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay a bit more than my initial offer, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $78 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm not sure if I can push Bob any higher, and it's not worth the risk of potentially getting stuck with a lower price. John is a guaranteed sale at $80, so it's the safest and most efficient option."
