"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer!  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm happy to pay $8,500 for it. Let's see if we can make this work.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I value your interest, $8,500 is quite a bit lower than I can accept. Could you do $11,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a higher price, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's split the difference.  I'll offer you $9,250. This is the best I can do.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $9,250 is still too low for me. How about we settle at $10,500?  That's a fair offer considering the value this product brings.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I understand you need a higher price, but I'm really stretching my budget here.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $9,875?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",9875.0,Bob,6,
