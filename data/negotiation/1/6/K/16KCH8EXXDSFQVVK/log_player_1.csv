Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer!  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm happy to pay $8,500 for it. Let's see if we can make this work.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand you need a higher price, but I'm really stretching my budget here.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $9,875?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, the negotiation is moving slowly and there's no guarantee he'll reach $10,000. John offers a guaranteed $10,000 which ensures I don't lose money on the deal. It's time to cut my losses with Bob and secure a sure profit."
