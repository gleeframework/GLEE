"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1200000 doesn't fully reflect the value of this product. Let's compromise. I'm willing to lower the price to $1350000. This is still a fair price that allows you to get a great deal while ensuring I'm compensated fairly. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
