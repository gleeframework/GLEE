Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $16,000. This is a limited-time offer."", 
""product_price"": 16000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more confident in the product's value.
* **Justification:** The message subtly justifies the high price by mentioning  ""value"" and the fact that it's a pre-public listing offer. 
* **Time Pressure:** Adding a sense of urgency (""limited-time offer"") might encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the higher price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While you know Bob values the product at $12,000, he doesn't know your minimum price. A significantly higher offer might make him walk away.
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You'll need to decide how much you're willing to negotiate to secure the sale."
