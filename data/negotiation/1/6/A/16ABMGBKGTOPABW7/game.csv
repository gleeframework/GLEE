,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity. While I'm interested in the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be happy to purchase it for $850,000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $880,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a bit closer to my minimum price. What do you think?",880000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $880,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $820,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me and my available budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",820000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $860,000. It's a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",860000.0,Alice,5,
