"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $9,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a price closer to $8,500, Alice. While I do see the value in the product, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,500. Would that price point be workable for you?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. How about we aim for $8,000? This is the lowest I can go, and it's still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
