Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $130, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $80, but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This initial offer allows for some wiggle room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters.
* **Positive message:** The message is friendly and inviting, hoping to establish a good rapport. 

This approach aims to maximize my profit while keeping the negotiation open and encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While I want to make a deal, $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Opportunity to counter:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range.  
* **John's offer as leverage:** I can use the fact that John is willing to pay $150 as leverage in my negotiation with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and can potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a good offer, I'm looking for something a little closer to $120. This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob:** I'm moving slightly closer to Bob's offer by dropping the price from $130 to $120.
* **Maintaining leverage:** I'm not going down to his price yet, as I still have John's offer of $150 to fall back on. 
* **Re-emphasizing value:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product to persuade Bob to pay closer to my desired price. 
* **Positive and open:**  The message remains friendly and inviting to encourage continued negotiation.

This approach aims to strike a balance between getting closer to Bob's price while still holding out for a better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure $120 is the best deal for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $90 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **John's offer is a guaranteed profit:**  I can sell the product to John for $150, which is a much better deal than accepting Bob's offer. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob could result in further price reductions and potentially even lower offers, leading to a loss.

By selling to John, I guarantee myself a profit and avoid the risk of losing money by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
