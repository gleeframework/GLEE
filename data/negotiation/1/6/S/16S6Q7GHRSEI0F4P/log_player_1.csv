Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the asking price of $2,000,000. "", ""product_price"": 2000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can confidently start with a higher offer to Bob. This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value without revealing your bottom line. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high price leaves room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle and still exceeding your minimum sale price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive or dislikes negotiation, you might slightly lower your initial offer. 
* **Market Demand:**  While you have John as a backup, a strong understanding of the product's overall market demand would inform your pricing strategy."
