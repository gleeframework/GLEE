{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a unique opportunity with significant value for your business. I'm confident it'll generate substantial returns for you.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. While $1,200,000 is better than John's offer, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I have 9 rounds left and a lot of room to maneuver."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 doesn't quite reflect the full value of this product.  It's truly unique and has the potential to significantly boost your business. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This price still leaves room for you to profit and allows me to get closer to my asking price.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so how about $1,250,000? This price still gives me some wiggle room to make a profit, and I'm willing to compromise to get this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm running out of time and Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum. Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be less profitable, so accepting Bob's offer at $1,250,000 is the best option at this point."
