"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a better deal anywhere else. If you're interested, please let me know as soon as possible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is under your $1,000,000 limit, you can do better. You know John is willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you create an opportunity to negotiate a lower price with her or proceed with purchasing from John."
