"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate that you think it's a great product, but $200 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $200 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $175. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $175 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $150. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $150, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $160, which is still a good compromise. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",160.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $155. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested. If not, I'll have to go with John's offer.",155.0,Bob,6,
