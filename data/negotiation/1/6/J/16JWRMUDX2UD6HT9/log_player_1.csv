Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you start with a higher offer to Bob, aiming for a potential profit.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's value and the existence of other potential buyers, creating a sense of urgency and desirability. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves some room for Bob to negotiate if he wants the product badly. This allows for a potentially even higher final price.

By setting a high initial price and creating a sense of scarcity, you maximize your chances of getting the best possible deal, either from Bob or from your backup buyer, John."
