"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $105? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice.  $105 is closer, but I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. Could you do $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you on the budget, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $100? That's a fair price that gives you a good deal and allows me to make a decent profit.  What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,
