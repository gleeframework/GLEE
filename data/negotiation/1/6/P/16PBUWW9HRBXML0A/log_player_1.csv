I've had 8 rounds of negotiation with Bob, and we haven't been able to reach an agreement that meets my minimum price.  At this point, I'm concerned that we're just going to go back and forth without making any progress.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000, which is still a decent profit for me."
