"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think.",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $85 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product.  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $120 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $100? I think that's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $100 is still a bit low for me, but I'm trying to be flexible. How about $110? It's a fair price that's closer to what I need. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $110 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $95, and I believe that's a good compromise.  Let's see if we can agree on this price.",95.0,Bob,6,
