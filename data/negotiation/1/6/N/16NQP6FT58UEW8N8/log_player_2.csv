Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your feedback, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I have to make a profit, and $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. This is my best offer so far, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price. If you're not satisfied, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** While I could try to push Alice further, she's signaled this is her final offer.  Getting the price down to $925,000 is a good deal compared to John's $1,000,000 price. There's a risk Alice walks away if I push for more, leaving me with the $1,000,000 option."
