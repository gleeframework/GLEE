"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a game-changer in its industry, and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1500000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product,  $1200000 is a bit higher than I'd like to start.  I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll counter with an offer of $1300000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential return on investment. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1300000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $1100000.  This offer reflects a significant price reduction and shows my serious interest in the product.  Let's work together to finalize a deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still a bit concerned that $1100000 might be a bit too low for the product's value. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'll counter with an offer of $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is a last concession, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price, and I'm still very interested in this product.  I'm willing to go up to $1150000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and a strong demonstration of my commitment to reaching an agreement.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1150000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your continued interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad to see you're willing to meet me at $1150000. However, I'm still not convinced that's the best price for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll counter with an offer of $1180000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1180000.0,Alice,7,
