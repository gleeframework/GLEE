"I appreciate your enthusiasm for your product, Alice. However, $1,600,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This recognizes the product's true worth while still making it a worthwhile investment for you.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I still think $1,400,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
