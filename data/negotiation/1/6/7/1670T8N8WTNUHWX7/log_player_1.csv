Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial high price will give you valuable information about his level of interest and potential for negotiation. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 with John, so there's no risk in aiming higher with Bob."
