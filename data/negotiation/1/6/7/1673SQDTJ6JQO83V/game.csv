"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $9500 for it. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11000. It's still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let's see if we can agree on this.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10500,  which is a fair price considering the product's value and our ongoing discussion. Let's try to finalize this deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
