"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $12000, which is a great price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is better than $15,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:**  Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a substantial discount. 
* **Value Justification:** He mentions interest in the product, but emphasizes the price as a barrier.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  $9,500 is still a decent profit for Alice (above her $8,000 value), leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11000. It's still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While $11,000 is closer to Bob's target, there's still room to try and get a better price.  He's willing to pay less than $15,000 and Alice is willing to go lower than $12,000.
* **Testing Alice's Limits:** Rejecting this offer allows Bob to gauge how far Alice is willing to go."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500,  which is a fair price considering the product's value and our ongoing discussion. Let's try to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  Bob's counteroffer is a smaller jump than before, showing a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price.
* **Appealing to Fairness:**  He emphasizes the fairness of the offer considering the product's value and the negotiation process.
* **Finality Suggestion:**  By suggesting ""finalizing this deal,"" Bob subtly increases the pressure on Alice to accept."
