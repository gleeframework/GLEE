"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that the initial price was a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product at $1,500,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm confident that this price reflects the product's value to you and will be a fair deal for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
