Round 2

``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about $100? That's still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $150. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 100}

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not willing to go above $95, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer. How about $96.25? Can you accept that?

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $96.25 is a good compromise, and it's getting closer to my desired price.  I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by continuing to negotiate."
