Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than John's offer ($1,500,000) sets a high anchor. This might make Bob more amenable to a price that's still above his valuation but seems like a ""deal.""
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, it leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can potentially still settle on a price higher than your minimum.

**Important:** This is a single-round negotiation, so you won't have a chance to revise your offer.  You need to strike a balance between a price that's appealing enough for Bob to accept and high enough to maximize your profit."
