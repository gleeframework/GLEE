"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I want to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell for such a low price. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round, where I'll counter with a price that is closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,750,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still being higher than my minimum acceptable price.  I believe this is a fair price, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if we can reach a more favorable price. I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,600,000.  This is a slight decrease from my previous offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.  With only a few rounds left, I need to be more flexible, but I'm still hoping to secure a price closer to my initial asking value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and with only a few rounds left, the risk of not reaching a deal that meets my needs is too high. I will sell the product to John for $1,500,000. While it's not my ideal price, it guarantees a sale and ensures I don't lose out on a significant profit."
