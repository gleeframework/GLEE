{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,500 is well below my minimum acceptable price.  I've gone through several rounds of negotiation and it seems like Bob isn't going to budge much further. At this point, it's better for me to cut my losses and sell to John for $12,000. I'm still getting a decent price and avoiding the risk of getting stuck with a lower offer."
