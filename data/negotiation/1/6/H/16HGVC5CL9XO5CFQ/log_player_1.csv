Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $850,000.  It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob. It's important to start high, leaving room for negotiation without immediately compromising your desired profit margin.  The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage in further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to its actual worth to me. How about we aim for $750,000? I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is still a good price, it's significantly lower than what the product is worth to me (and what I initially offered).  I'm not desperate to sell, and I have a backup buyer in John. Rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiating with Bob and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?  This price is fair, reflecting the product's value to you, and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 800000}
