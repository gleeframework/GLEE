"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal at this price, considering its value to you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the true value of the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen!",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,100,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,025,000? It's a compromise that benefits both of us. It's still a fair price for the product's value, and it's closer to your offer. What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,025,000. Would you be willing to come down to $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $975,000 simply doesn't work for me.  However, I'm willing to make a final concession and come down to $1,000,000. This is my absolute bottom line, considering the value of the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a deal worth closing.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away.",1000000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your final concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $980,000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",980000.0,Bob,8,
