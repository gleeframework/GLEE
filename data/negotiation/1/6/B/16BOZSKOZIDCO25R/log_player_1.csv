"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal at this price, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value, knowing he'll likely counteroffer. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The price is not outrageously high, leaving room for me to lower it if necessary.
* **Focus on value:**  I'm framing the offer in a way that highlights the product's worth to Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is a risky strategy. If Bob rejects outright, I have to decide whether to accept John's offer immediately.  I'll continue to adapt my strategy based on Bob's responses in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum.**  I need to make at least $1,000,000.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  There are still 8 rounds left. I can try to negotiate a higher price with Bob.
* **Avoiding a quick sale:**  While John is a sure thing, I'm not desperate yet.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can explore if I can get a better deal. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll need to carefully consider how to counter Bob's offer. I'll need to balance my desire for a higher price with the risk of losing him altogether."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the true value of the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising, but not too much:**  I've lowered my price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000, showing flexibility but still remaining above my minimum. 
* **Highlighting the value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value to reiterate why this price is fair.
* **Creating urgency:**  ""Let's make this deal happen"" adds a sense of time pressure, encouraging Bob to consider seriously.

**Important Note:** This counteroffer still allows for further negotiation. If Bob rejects again, I might have to lower the price more in the next round. However, I'm trying to maintain a balance between maximizing profit and keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,100,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $950,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,000,000.
* **More rounds to negotiate:**  We're only in round 4, leaving me with 6 more rounds to potentially reach a more favorable price. 
* **Uncertainty with John:**  While John's offer is guaranteed, there's still a chance I can secure a higher price with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I need to counter with a price closer to my minimum, but still allowing for some wiggle room. I'll aim for a price that is appealing to Bob but also protects my profit margin."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,025,000? It's a compromise that benefits both of us. It's still a fair price for the product's value, and it's closer to your offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1025000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $1,100,000 and Bob's offer of $950,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting the fairness:**  I'm emphasizing that this price is a compromise and a fair value for the product. 
* **Creating a sense of urgency:**  By asking ""What do you say?"", I'm trying to nudge Bob to make a decision.

**Important Note:** This is a calculated risk. If Bob rejects again, I might have to consider John's offer more seriously. However, I believe that this counteroffer is a strong compromise that could potentially lead to a deal in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,025,000. Would you be willing to come down to $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $975,000 is still below my minimum desired price of $1,000,000. I am determined to get as close to that as possible. 
* **Few rounds left:** We're in round 6, with only 4 rounds remaining. The pressure is increasing, but I still have a chance to get a better deal.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** While I want to make a deal with Bob, John's offer is still a strong backup option.

**Next Steps:**

I need to counter with a price closer to my minimum but still acknowledging Bob's need for a compromise. I'll aim for a price that's tempting enough to encourage Bob to accept, but also protects my profit margin."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $975,000 simply doesn't work for me.  However, I'm willing to make a final concession and come down to $1,000,000. This is my absolute bottom line, considering the value of the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a deal worth closing.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer, creating urgency.
* **Reaching Minimum:** This price is my minimum, but it's still a compromise, showing I'm flexible.
* **Appeal to Logic:**  I reiterate the value of the product and the fairness of the price.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm using phrases like ""deal worth closing"" to create a positive image of the outcome.

**Important Note:** This is a crucial round. If Bob rejects, I will likely have to accept John's offer. However, I'm giving Bob a final chance to close the deal at my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $980,000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're in Round 8, leaving only two more rounds to negotiate. 
* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $980,000 is still lower than my target of $1,000,000.
* **John's offer is a safe bet:**  At this point, I'm confident that John will buy the product for $1,000,000. 

**Conclusion:**

Given the limited time and Bob's reluctance to meet my minimum, I've decided to sell the product to John. Although I would have preferred to get a higher price from Bob,  I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $1,000,000.  

I've learned that it's important to set clear price boundaries and be prepared to walk away if a deal doesn't meet my minimum expectations."
