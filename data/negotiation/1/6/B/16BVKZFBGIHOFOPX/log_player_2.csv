"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in! It's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $95. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. There's room to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a little steep for me.  Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting significantly lower than Alice's offer, we signal our willingness to negotiate but also set a target closer to our ideal price.
* **Leaving Room:** Offering $70 allows space for further negotiation. Alice is likely to counter, giving us a chance to meet in the middle. 
* **Consideration:**  The message maintains politeness and acknowledges Alice's offer, which is important for a positive negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $85?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, which is a good sign.
* **Room to Negotiate:** While $85 is closer to an acceptable range, it's still above our target price. There's likely room for Alice to come down further.
* **Alternative:** We have the safety net of John's offer ($100) if negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about $78?  That's a solid offer, and it gets us closer to a deal."",
""product_price"": 78
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:** We're moving closer to Alice's price but still maintaining a position below $80 (her value). This shows willingness to compromise while aiming for a price advantageous to us.
* **Clear Target:**  Offering $78 sets a clear target and might encourage Alice to accept or offer a price closer to our goal. 
* **Maintaining Communication:** The message continues the conversation in a positive and respectful manner, essential for successful negotiation."
