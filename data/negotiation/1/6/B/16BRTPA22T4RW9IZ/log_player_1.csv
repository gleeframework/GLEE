{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get as close to Bob's perceived value as possible without giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to find something within my budget of $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $130.  I'll counteroffer with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $115? It's still a great price for this product and closer to your budget."", ""product_price"": 115}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking for a price closer to my budget. Would it be possible to offer the product at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It seems like Bob is firm on his $100 offer.  While I could keep counteroffering, it's likely he'll continue to reject my offers. To avoid potentially going back and forth for a long time, I'll take the guaranteed $100 from John and move on."
