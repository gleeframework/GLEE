**Reasoning:** 

At this point, Bob is steadily increasing his offer, and we are getting closer to a fair price.  While we could potentially push for a slightly higher price, there's also the risk that Bob might walk away if we push too hard. Accepting his offer of $1,875,000 secures a significant profit above our minimum and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
