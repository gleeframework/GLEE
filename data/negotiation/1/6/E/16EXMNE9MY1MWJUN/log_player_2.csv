"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $12,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for $12,000 from John, so there's no immediate reason to accept Alice's offer of $10,000.  Rejecting and counter-offering gives Bob a chance to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point, significantly lower than Alice's offer but still within the range where she could potentially make a profit.
* **Strategic message:** The message expresses interest while making it clear that Bob is serious about negotiating.
* **Room for negotiation:** This offer leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects it, ensuring a back-and-forth that could lead to a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to be closer to $10,000 to make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a significant value for you, and it's still above my minimum.  Let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Alice's offer of $9,500 is a good deal for Bob. It's well below his maximum price of $12,000 and gives him a $2,500 savings.
* **Risk:**  While there's a chance Bob could negotiate a slightly lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting the offer or delaying the process is not worth it.
* **Time:** With 7 rounds remaining, accepting this offer ensures a quick and efficient transaction.

It's better to secure a good deal now than to risk losing out on a better price due to prolonged negotiation."
