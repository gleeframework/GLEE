"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $8,000, and I have a backup option with John. I'll see if I can get Bob to come up a little more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to be closer to $10,000 to make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a significant value for you, and it's still above my minimum.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9500}
