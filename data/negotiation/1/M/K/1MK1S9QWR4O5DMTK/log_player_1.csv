Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $140 gives Bob a small discount while allowing you to maximize your profit. This approach is closer to Bob's maximum valuation, increasing the likelihood of acceptance.
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $100 to John if Bob refuses, so there's little risk in aiming higher with Bob."
