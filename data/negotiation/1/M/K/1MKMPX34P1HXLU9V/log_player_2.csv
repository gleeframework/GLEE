"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to your operations. While I can't disclose specifics about the product just yet, I can assure you that it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,250,000, which represents a significant discount from its true value. This is a limited-time offer, as I have another interested buyer ready to purchase it for $1,000,000. Let me know your decision by [Date/Time]. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer:** $1,250,000
* **Your maximum willingness to pay:** $1,500,000
* **John's price:** $1,500,000

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $250,000 compared to buying from John.  It's a good deal, and you still get the product for less than your maximum value."
