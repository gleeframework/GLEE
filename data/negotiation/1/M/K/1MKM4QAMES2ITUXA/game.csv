"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000.

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. Considering the product's value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to me.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product and allows for some room for you to make a profit. Let's aim for a solution that works for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your offer of $13,000. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to make a slightly smaller concession. I'm offering it to you for $13,500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to me.",13500.0,Alice,5,
