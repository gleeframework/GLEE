Given its value and quality, I'm extending this opportunity to acquire it at an exclusive price of $99. This is a special offer tailored for discerning individuals like yourself. Don't miss out on this chance to enhance your experience with our top-tier product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $99.

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  Even though the product is worth $120 to Alice, she is offering it for $99. This is a good deal for Bob, as it's less than what he'd pay John.
* **Bob's goal is to save money.**  Accepting Alice's offer allows him to do just that."
