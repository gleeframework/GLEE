"I'm very interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1400000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $1600000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1600000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I was thinking of $1400000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from there. How about $1520000?",1520000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your offer, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1520000. I'm thinking of a price of $1580000. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair compromise. What do you think?",1580000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1580000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1540000?",1540000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your offer, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1540000. I'm thinking of a price of $1570000. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair compromise. What do you think?",1570000.0,Alice,7,
