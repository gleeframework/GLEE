"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $1,400,000 is a little too high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $1,300,000?  This still gives you a significant value on the product, and it's a fair price for me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
