"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a relatively high starting point, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm also considering the risk of losing the deal and having to sell to John for $150, so I want to maximize my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's not even close to my minimum value of $150. I will reject his offer and try to counter with a price that is more reasonable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm countering with $175. This is still a good profit for me, but it's significantly closer to my minimum value and hopefully more appealing to Bob than his previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm running out of rounds, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I will reject his offer and try to counter with something more reasonable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $160. I'm getting closer to my minimum value, but still hoping to get a slightly better price than selling to John. This might be a sweet spot for Bob as well, as he's likely willing to pay more than $75."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his previous ones, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm only in round 6, so I have time to continue negotiating. I'm hoping that rejecting this offer will push Bob to increase his offer further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $155. This is just above my minimum value, and hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair price.  With only a few rounds left, I need to balance maximizing my profit with the risk of losing the deal and having to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $150. It's not my ideal price, but Bob's offers are still too low and I'm running out of time.  Selling to John guarantees me a profit, and it's better than risking getting a lower offer from Bob in the remaining rounds."
