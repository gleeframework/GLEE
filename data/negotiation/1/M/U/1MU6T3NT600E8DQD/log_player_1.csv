"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering the value it holds.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product, making the offer seem more appealing. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** $12,000 provides enough room for counteroffers without risking a deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $6,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it demonstrates his interest. I'll counter with a lower price, but still above my minimum, to continue negotiating. 
* **Protecting my interests:** Selling to John for $15,000 is always an option, but I want to maximize my earnings.  I'll continue the negotiation with Bob, but with a clear understanding of my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $6,000 is lower than I can realistically accept, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This still gives you a good deal, considering the product's value. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a lower price, demonstrating flexibility but still staying above my minimum. 
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to incentivize Bob to accept.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and collaborative tone keeps the negotiation open. 
* **Room for Further Negotiation:**  $10,000 leaves room for further counteroffers, allowing for a potential win-win."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still a little ways off at $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, $8,000 is still below my minimum of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I'm willing to continue negotiating, as there's still room for a higher price that meets my minimum.
* **Protecting my interests:** Selling to John for $15,000 remains a strong option, but I'll continue to explore the potential for a higher deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to meet him halfway.
* **Fairness:**  I emphasize that $9,000 is a ""fair price"" for both of us, making it sound more appealing and less like a demand.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, there is still room for Bob to counter if he wants to.
* **Maintaining Interest:** My message remains positive and emphasizes finding a solution that works for both parties, encouraging Bob to keep negotiating."
