"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, considering the value the product brings to your life.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not convinced that $10,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,5,
