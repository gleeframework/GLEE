Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to your operation, potentially saving and generating significant revenue.  Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. I think it's a price that reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, I want to start negotiations significantly higher with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring I don't settle for less than my minimum. 
* **Value-Based Pitch:**  Rather than focusing solely on price, I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob's specific needs. This justifies the high asking price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While my initial offer is high, I've used phrasing that suggests I'm open to discussing the price further.  This gives Bob the opportunity to counter-offer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price above my minimum."
