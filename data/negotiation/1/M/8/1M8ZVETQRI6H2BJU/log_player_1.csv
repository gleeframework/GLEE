Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,000,000) as possible while still exceeding our minimum (1,200,000).
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning other interested parties (John) creates a sense of urgency and might encourage Bob to act quickly. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially reaching a price that's still very favorable for us. 

**Important:** This strategy assumes we have no way of knowing Bob's exact willingness to pay beyond the $1,000,000 valuation.  If we had more information, we could adjust our offer accordingly."
