"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this point.  I'm willing to offer $9,500. I believe this price is fair, and it gives us both some room to negotiate.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $10,250, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This price is fair, and it allows for a reasonable profit margin for you. Let's find a way to make this work.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're making progress. However, $10,250 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $11,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have to make a profit, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $10,750. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer, and it's a price that I believe is fair for both of us.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm open to discussing other terms if there's anything else that can help us bridge the gap.",10750.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $11,000, but this is the final price I'm willing to consider. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider other options. I'm confident that this price still reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to make a deal with you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm ready to make a final offer.  I'm willing to go up to $10,900.  This is a significant commitment from my end, and it reflects the value I place on this product.  It also leaves room for you to make a profit. Let's close this deal. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to explore other options.  ",10900.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your commitment, Bob, but I'm afraid I'm running out of room to maneuver. I can offer the product to you for $11,250, but I'm not willing to go any higher. This is my absolute maximum price, and I'm counting on you to make a decision. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",11250.0,Alice,9,
