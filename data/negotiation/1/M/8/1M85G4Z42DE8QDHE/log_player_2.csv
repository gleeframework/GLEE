"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a better deal.  There's no guarantee Alice will accept a counteroffer, but it's worth trying to save as much money as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. Offering $900,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation, and hopefully, Alice will see the value in closing the deal at this price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $920,000, which is only $20,000 more than Bob's last counteroffer.  While there's always the chance she might come down further, it's risky to keep rejecting offers. Bob has a limited budget, and buying from John would cost an extra $80,000. Accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible choice, ensuring Bob gets the product while staying within his budget."
