"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it for $2,300,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth, and I'm open to discussing it further."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Confident Tone:** The message emphasizes the product's value and my belief in the offered price. This projects confidence and potentially influences Bob's perception of the product's worth. 
* **Openness to Negotiation:** While starting high, I'm signaling willingness to discuss the price, indicating I'm open to reaching a mutually beneficial deal.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Potential Profit:**  By starting high, I increase the chance of securing a price closer to my desired outcome.
2. **Understand Bob's Position:**  His response will reveal how aggressively he's willing to negotiate and how much he values the product.
3. **Maintain Control:**  I set the initial negotiation frame, which can be advantageous throughout the process.

I'm aware that this initial offer might be met with resistance, but it provides valuable information and sets the stage for a potentially profitable negotiation. I have the security of John's offer, allowing me to negotiate confidently with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I can afford. My counteroffer is $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's closer to his perceived value, I still have room to negotiate before considering John's offer. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm serious about the product's value and not willing to settle for a price that's too low. I'm prepared to counter with a price closer to my minimum, but still leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is considerably below the product's true market value and what I'm willing to accept. I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,850,000?"",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and willingness to negotiate while firmly reiterating that my price floor is significantly higher.  By proposing $1,850,000, I'm suggesting a compromise that moves us closer to a potential agreement.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer remains above my minimum of $1,500,000, allowing room for further negotiation. It also sends a clear message that I'm seeking a price that reflects the product's actual worth.
* **Maintaining Control:** I'm continuing to guide the negotiation towards a favorable outcome.  I'm willing to be flexible, but not at the expense of devaluing the product or settling for a price significantly below what I know it's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am still working within a limited budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price in further rounds, there's a risk that Bob might:

* **Walk away:** He has already significantly increased his offer, and pushing further might make him reconsider the deal entirely.
* **Become less flexible:** Further negotiation might lead to smaller concessions, making the time and effort less worthwhile.

Accepting this offer guarantees a profit above my minimum threshold and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether by pushing for a slightly higher price."
