"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your business.  I understand it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000.  This is a significant opportunity to acquire a product that will bring you a substantial return on investment. Please let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than your $1,000,000 maximum and buying from John would cost you more."
