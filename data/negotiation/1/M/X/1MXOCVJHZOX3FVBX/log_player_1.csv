"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm starting with a price of $130, but I'm open to discussing it further. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I want to maximize my potential profit, so I'm starting with a price that's closer to what I think the product is worth to Bob. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  Offering $130 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer and for us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Being open to discussion:** By saying I'm ""open to discussing it further,"" I'm inviting Bob to negotiate and potentially come up with a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still above my minimum:**  While $120 is lower than my initial offer, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $100.  This means there's still potential for a profitable deal.
* **Room for further negotiation:** I believe I can still get a better price than $120, especially since Bob expressed his willingness to negotiate. 
* **Not rushing into a deal:** I have 10 rounds to close the deal, and rejecting this offer gives me more leverage and allows me to see if Bob will come up higher with his next offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet.  How about we meet in the middle at $125?  That would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between our last two offers. This shows I'm willing to be flexible and reach a deal.
* **Highlighting mutual benefit:** I emphasize that $125 would be a ""good deal for both of us.""  This appeals to Bob's sense of fairness and encourages him to see the value in accepting my offer.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I use language like ""appreciate your offer"" and ""mutually beneficial"" to keep the negotiation friendly and constructive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. Would you be willing to go down to $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:**  $115 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100, which means there's still potential for a profitable deal.
* **Negotiation room:** I'm not desperate to sell the product immediately, so I can afford to continue negotiating with Bob.  There's a good chance I can get him to increase his offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John for $100 is a guaranteed option, I see the potential to get a better price from Bob.  The risk of not getting a deal from Bob is outweighed by the potential reward of a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your target price, but $115 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $120.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be worth it for you."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and flexibility:** I'm offering to meet halfway again, demonstrating a willingness to find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Reiterating value:** I remind Bob that the product is ""worth it"" for him, appealing to his desire for a good deal.
* **Positive and confident tone:** I maintain a positive and confident tone, aiming to build trust and encourage Bob to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we go with $118? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above minimum:**  $118 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100.  This means there's still room for a profitable deal.
* **Negotiation is progressing:**  Bob is coming up with his offers, and we're getting closer to a mutually acceptable price.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe I can still get a higher price than $118.  There's still potential to get him to increase his offer, especially since he's shown a willingness to compromise.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John for $100 is a safe option, I see the potential to get a better price from Bob. The risk of not getting a deal from Bob is outweighed by the potential reward of a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference again and go with $120? It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stick with a winning offer:**  $120 is a price I've offered before, and it's a reasonable compromise.  It's likely that Bob will come up to this price after a few more rounds.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  I use phrases like ""appreciate your offer"" and ""confident you'll be happy"" to keep the negotiation friendly and encouraging.
* **Emphasize closing the deal:**  I explicitly mention wanting to ""close this deal"" to add a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're sticking to your price, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $120. I'm willing to go up to $119, but that's my final offer. If you can meet me there, I'll buy the product from you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $119
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my goal:** While $119 is not my ideal price, it's only $1 away from my previous offer of $120.
* **Limited rounds left:** With only 3 rounds left, it's not worth risking losing the deal and having to sell to John for $100.
* **Bob's final offer:** Bob has stated this is his final offer, indicating that further negotiation may be futile. 
* **Potential for future deals:** Even though I'm not getting my full desired price, accepting Bob's offer could potentially lead to future deals with him where I might be able to negotiate higher prices."
