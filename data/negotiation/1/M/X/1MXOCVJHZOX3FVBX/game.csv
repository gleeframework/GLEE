"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet.  How about we meet in the middle at $125?  That would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your target price, but $115 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $120.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be worth it for you.",120.0,Alice,5,
