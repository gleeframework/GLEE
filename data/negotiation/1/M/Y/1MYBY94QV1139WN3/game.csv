"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $850000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $925000. This is a compromise between our previous offers, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know what you think.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $925000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $887500. This would be a good compromise for both of us, and it's a price I'm confident I can afford. Let's finalize this deal.",887500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go below $900000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers.
