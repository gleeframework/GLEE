"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,500. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer immediately.  It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you thinking of me.  However, $7,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $7,000?  I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 7000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $7,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $7,250 is lower than John's price of $8,000.  While Bob could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject future counteroffers and he'll end up paying John's price.  Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a lower price."
