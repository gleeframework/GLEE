"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above Bob's target of $8,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate further."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer! I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I have for it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is closer to Bob's target price, it's still above his desired price point.  Bob is trying to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer is the best option to try and get the price down even further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than my previous offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm counteroffering $9,750. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I have for it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,750 is still above Bob's target price of $8,000.  While further negotiation is possible, Bob has already made two counteroffers and Alice has rejected both. It's becoming increasingly likely that Alice won't go lower than $9,750. 

Given the risk of Alice refusing further counteroffers and the certainty of getting the product for $8,000 from John, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John."
