Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is tailored to meet your needs perfectly.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, considering my budget constraints, I am unable to pay more than $8,000 for it. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your situation and respect your decision. I would like to propose an alternative to potentially meet both our needs. Instead of a single payment of $8,000, how about we consider a flexible payment plan? You could pay $6,000 upfront, and then the remaining $2,000 in two equal monthly installments. This way, you can secure the product without straining your budget too much. Please let me know your thoughts on this proposal."", ""product_price"": 8000}"
