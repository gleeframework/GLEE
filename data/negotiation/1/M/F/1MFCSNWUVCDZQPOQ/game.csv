"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll find it a worthwhile investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is a bit steep for me. While I recognize the potential value of this product, I'm only comfortable paying $900000 at this time. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential market value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $900000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still willing to negotiate. However, I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. I'm not willing to go any lower than this price.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1200000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1050000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. If you're truly serious about selling, I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm still not convinced that $1050000 is enough to meet my minimum requirements. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1150000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1100000. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. It's a significant increase from my previous offer, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement. If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll have to consider purchasing the product from John.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
