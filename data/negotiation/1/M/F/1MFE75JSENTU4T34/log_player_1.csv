Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product is high to you, but I believe we can find a better agreement. I am willing to pay $850,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  While $850,000 is more than John's offer, it's still significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I have 8 rounds left, and I think I can get a better deal with Bob."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I have 6 rounds left and I don't want to settle for less than $900,000."
