Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  By starting at $100, I am setting a high anchor point for the negotiation. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  $100 is higher than my minimum acceptable price ($80), giving me flexibility to make concessions if Bob counters.
* **Initial Enthusiasm:**  My message is friendly and expresses confidence in the product's value, making it more likely that Bob will consider my offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Acceptable Price:** Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No Need for Further Negotiation:** There's no point in risking a further negotiation with Bob, potentially leading to a lower price or a stalemate.
* **Time is Money:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and certain sale at my minimum acceptable price."
