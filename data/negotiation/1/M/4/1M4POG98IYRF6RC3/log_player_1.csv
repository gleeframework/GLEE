Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I believe it's a bit above my budget, and I'm not sure if the features and benefits are worth the full $15000. Can we meet in the middle at $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
