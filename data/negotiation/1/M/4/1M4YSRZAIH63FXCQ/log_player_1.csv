Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to negotiate down slightly while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum perceived value makes the deal more appealing and less likely to be rejected outright. 
* **Safety Net:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice can still sell to John for her minimum acceptable price."
