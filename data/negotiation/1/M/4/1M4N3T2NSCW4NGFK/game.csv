"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to us, but we're open to discussing a fair price. Let's aim for something mutually beneficial. How about we start at $110?",110.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $95 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",95.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I'd like to try to accommodate you while still ensuring we receive a fair value for our product. How does $100 sound as a compromise? It's slightly above your offer, but it also reflects the value we place on the product.",100.0,Alice,3,
