"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $14000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $10000, and I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value I place on the product and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $11000 for the product.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm getting closer to my target, but I still need to get a bit more. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12500 and my original offer of $14000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13750. This is my final offer, and I hope we can seal the deal.",13750.0,Alice,5,
