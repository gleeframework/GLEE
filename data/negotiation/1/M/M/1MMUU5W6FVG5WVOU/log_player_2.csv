"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell this product to you for $14,000. It's a one-time offer, and I think it's a fair price considering its value to you is $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is slightly better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. It's a fair price, considering your value for it is $12,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $13,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13,500. This is my best counteroffer, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $13,500 is a better price than the $15,000 John is asking.
* **Alice is likely to stick to her counteroffer:** Alice already lowered her price from $14,000 to $13,500.  It's unlikely she'll go lower, and Bob might risk losing the deal if he rejects again.
* **Bob is already saving money:** $13,500 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's lower than his initial maximum of $15,000. 

Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a good price while minimizing the risk of further negotiation."
