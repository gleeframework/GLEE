"Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1000000. This price reflects its high value and the potential for significant returns. I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to the product's actual value. I'm willing to offer $900000. This still allows you a healthy profit, and it's a price that's within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900000 is still a bit low for me. Given the product's potential value to you, I'm willing to come down slightly to $950000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us. I'm eager to reach an agreement and move forward.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $950000 is still a bit higher than where I'd like to be. I'm willing to go up to $925000. This represents a substantial investment for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's aim for a quick agreement to make this happen.",925000.0,Bob,4,
