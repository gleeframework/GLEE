# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1000000. This price reflects its high value and the potential for significant returns. I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900000 is still a bit low for me. Given the product's potential value to you, I'm willing to come down slightly to $950000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us. I'm eager to reach an agreement and move forward.
