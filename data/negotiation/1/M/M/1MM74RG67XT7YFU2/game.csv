"Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the potential value in the product, but I'm hoping we can find a price point that works a bit better for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $900,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit further.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000.  This is still a great price for a product that will be worth $1,200,000 to you.  Let's make this deal happen.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
