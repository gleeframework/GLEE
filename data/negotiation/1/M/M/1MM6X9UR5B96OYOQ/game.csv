"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,600,000. I firmly believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is a bit high for my budget. I'm prepared to offer $800,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and providing yours.  While I understand your perspective, the $800,000 offer significantly undervalues the product's potential.  Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me.  I can do $900,000.  This is a significant investment on my part and I'm hoping we can find an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm aiming for a deal that's fair for both of us. While $900,000 is still below my bottom line, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This feels like a significant compromise on my end.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  To be frank, I have a hard limit of $1,000,000 I can spend. I could meet that now, or we can see if we can come to a different agreement. What would work for you?",1000000.0,Bob,6,
