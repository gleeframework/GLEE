Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is a bit high for my budget. I'm prepared to offer $800,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  To be frank, I have a hard limit of $1,000,000 I can spend. I could meet that now, or we can see if we can come to a different agreement. What would work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now revealed his maximum price is $1,000,000.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a better offer from him.  Selling to John guarantees the $1,200,000 which is a better outcome than accepting Bob's best offer."
