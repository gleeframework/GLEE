"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in your product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time. This is my best and final offer, as I have other options available.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your offer, but it doesn't align with our valuation. We're willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $950,000. This is our best offer considering the value we place on the product and the interest it has generated. We hope this proposal is more in line with what you're looking for.",950000.0,Alice,3,
