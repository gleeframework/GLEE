"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand you're on a budget, but $60 is significantly lower than what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $145?",145.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. While $145 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $75? That feels like a fair offer to me.",75.0,Bob,4,
