You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can definitely do better than $12,000.  Rejecting the offer gives you a chance to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?

While $11,500 is better than Alice's original offer, it's still a bit high.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can get closer to my target price."

Alice's offer:

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and $11,250 is a good deal considering my budget and the product's value to me. I'll accept this offer."
