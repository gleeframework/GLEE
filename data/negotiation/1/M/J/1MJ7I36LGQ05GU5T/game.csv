"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $85 is the lowest I can go.  This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $100 to you.",85.0,Alice,3,

"I understand it's a good product, Alice, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $77?",77.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $77 is still a little too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'll take $81 for the product. That's a fair price for both of us.",81.0,Alice,5,
