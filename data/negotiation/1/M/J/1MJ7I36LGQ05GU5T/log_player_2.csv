"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We want to anchor the negotiation lower than Alice's initial offer. $70 is a significant drop, but it leaves us room to negotiate upwards if needed.
* **Polite and Interested:** We maintain a positive tone to keep the negotiation amicable and express our genuine interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $85 is the lowest I can go.  This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $100 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:**  While Alice moved closer to a reasonable price, $85 is still above our target. We know her value is $80, so there's room to haggle. 
* **Alternative Exists:** We have the backup option of John at $100, so there's no pressure to accept a price we're not comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand it's a good product, Alice, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $77?"",
""product_price"": 77
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** We're demonstrating flexibility by moving closer to Alice's price.  $77 is a compromise between our previous offer and her current one.
* **Psychological Edge:** Offering an uneven number like $77 can sometimes be perceived as more considered and less arbitrary than a round number. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:** We're still a good bit below her last offer, keeping the pressure on Alice to move closer to her true value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $77 is still a little too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'll take $81 for the product. That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Alice has come down significantly and is now only $1 above her known value. 
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield a dollar or two more in savings, which might not be worth the additional time and effort. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If we push too hard, Alice might be less willing to negotiate, and we risk reaching our fallback option of buying from John for $100."
