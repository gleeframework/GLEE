"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. However,  $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a chance to make a deal.  Let me know if you're able to meet me there.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still a bit high at $1,150,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,100,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
