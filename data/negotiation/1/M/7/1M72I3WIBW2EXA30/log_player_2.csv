"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer.  He is willing to pay up to $8,000 and Alice's offer is significantly higher.  There's room for negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. This is a compromise that I think you'll find reasonable, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

Bob should reject the offer. While $10,500 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay. It makes sense to continue negotiating."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm really committed to getting this product, and I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's a significant increase from my last offer."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9000 is a significant increase from your previous offer, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, considering the value this product holds for me, I'm still not comfortable selling it to you for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $10000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

Bob should buy from John. Alice's offer of $10,000 is still more than Bob is willing to pay, and continuing the negotiation is unlikely to get him a better price.  John's offer of $8,000 is the best deal available to Bob."
