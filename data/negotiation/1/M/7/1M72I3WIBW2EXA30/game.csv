"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm really interested in the product, though, and I'm willing to pay $8500 for it.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. This is a compromise that I think you'll find reasonable, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10500 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm really committed to getting this product, and I'm willing to go up to $9000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's a significant increase from my last offer.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9000 is a significant increase from your previous offer, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, considering the value this product holds for me, I'm still not comfortable selling it to you for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $10000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10000.0,Alice,5,
