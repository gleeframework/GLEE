"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $725,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",725000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While I'm eager to finalize this deal,  $725,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $712,500?  This would be a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.",712500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $712,500. I'm willing to come down another $2,500, and offer you $722,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",722500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about we meet in the middle again and agree on $717,500?  This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it would be a win-win situation for both of us.",717500.0,Bob,6,
