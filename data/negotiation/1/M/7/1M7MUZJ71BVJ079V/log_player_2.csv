"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

It's not a good deal for Bob to buy the product for $1,200,000 when he can get it from John for $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, and I'm glad you're interested in the product. However, $850,000 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.

While $1,100,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice is willing to come down closer to Bob's target price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $950,000 is still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.

Alice is still too high.  The negotiation is getting close to Bob's maximum price, but it's still not a good deal.  Buying from John at $800,000 is the best choice at this point, as it guarantees Bob gets the product within his budget."
