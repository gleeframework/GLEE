"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800,000. Let me know if you're interested!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm,  $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering my budget and the product's value to me. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, and I'm glad you're interested in the product. However, $850,000 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering our respective goals.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $950,000 is still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
