"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its true value. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $750,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to make this work.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate.  However, $850,000 is still too far below what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers, so let's try $875,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, which is closer to my budget and still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",825000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer! However, $825,000 still doesn't quite work for me.  To make this deal happen, I'm willing to go down to $850,000.  This price is a fair compromise and allows me to meet my minimum requirements. Let's finalize this agreement.",850000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $850,000. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, as I mentioned before, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. I'm not willing to go any higher than that.",825000.0,Bob,8,
