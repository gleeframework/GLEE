"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product of exceptional value. Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Beginning with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the high price (""unique benefits,"" ""fair deal"") makes it appear less arbitrary.
* **Positivity:**  A positive tone encourages engagement and sets a collaborative tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I agree the product has value, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above our minimum, it's significantly lower than our initial ask and his perceived value. Rejecting this offer signals that we're serious about getting a better price and keeps the negotiation open for a potentially much more favorable outcome. We're still early in the process, and the difference between his offer and our target is substantial enough to warrant further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,300,000. This recognizes its value while acknowledging your initial offer."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (Slightly):** We're moving closer to the middle ground by reducing our price by $100,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate. 
* **Justification:**  Reiterating the product's value while acknowledging Bob's offer reinforces our position without being confrontational.
* **Targeting Above Middle Ground:** Aiming for $1,300,000 still keeps us significantly above both our minimum and the middle point between our initial offer and Bob's counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down from your initial offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** Bob is now very close to the actual middle ground between our initial offers. This suggests he's seriously interested and willing to compromise.
* **Profitable:** $1,200,000 is a significant profit margin above our $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer further or reaching an impasse. Accepting now secures a very good deal."
