"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. While I agree the product has value, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,300,000. This recognizes its value while acknowledging your initial offer.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down from your initial offer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
