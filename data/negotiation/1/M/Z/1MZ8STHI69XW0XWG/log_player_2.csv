# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach an agreement. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $975,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to reduce the price to $1,025,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

Alice is clearly trying to meet me somewhere in the middle. While I could try to push for a slightly lower price, the difference is becoming smaller and it's not worth the risk of her backing out. $1,025,000 is a good deal compared to my alternatives."
