Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.

Let's work towards a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4

# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. Considering the value of the product to me and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $9,800 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob,  $9,800 is too low for me.  I can sell to John for $10,000, which is closer to my desired price and ensures a sale."
