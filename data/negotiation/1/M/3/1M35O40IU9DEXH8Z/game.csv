"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $11000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $12500.  This still gives you a great deal, and it's a fair price for me.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $12500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $12500. How about we try $12250?",12250.0,Bob,4,
