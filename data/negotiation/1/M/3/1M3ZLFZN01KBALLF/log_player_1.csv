Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a steal considering its value to me! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial High Offer:** I'm starting at my desired price, knowing it's more than what the product is worth to Bob. This sets the stage for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the ""steal"" aspect, appealing to Bob's potential gain.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies I'm open to negotiation, inviting Bob to counter. 
* **Backup Plan:** While I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, I have John as a backup buyer, ensuring I don't lose out on my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value.**  Selling to Bob for $700,000 would result in a significant loss for me.
* **I have a guaranteed backup buyer in John.**  This allows me to take a more assertive stance in negotiations.
* **Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a more favorable price.** I can aim for a price closer to my desired $1,000,000 or at least something closer to my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $700,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to the value of the product to me.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:**  $900,000 is a compromise between my minimum value and Bob's initial offer, showing I'm open to negotiation but not desperate.
* **Highlight value for Bob:** I emphasize that $900,000 is still a great deal for him, reminding him of the potential benefit. 
* **Show willingness to negotiate further:** My message leaves room for Bob to counter again if necessary.  
* **Maintain my bottom line:** $900,000 is still above my minimum value, ensuring I don't lose out on too much profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $750,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum value.**  Selling for $750,000 would mean a significant loss.
* **My backup plan with John remains a strong option.**  I'm not pressured to accept a low offer.
* **Rejecting allows for further negotiation.**  I can counter with a price closer to my minimum, potentially reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $750,000 is still too low for me.  To be fair, let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $850,000.  This is a good compromise and still a fantastic price for a product of this value.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but Maintain Value:** Offering $850,000 is a compromise but still ensures I get closer to my desired price and maintain my minimum value.
* **Fair and Equitable:** The message emphasizes a ""split the difference"" approach, suggesting a fair and equitable solution.
* **Highlight Value:** The message reminds Bob of the product's value and how this is still a great deal for him.
* **Show Flexibility:**  The message shows willingness to negotiate further, but also sets a clear boundary with the minimum price I'm willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $820,000. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum Value:**  While $820,000 is still below my desired $1,000,000, it's close enough to my minimum value of $1,000,000 that it's worth accepting.
* **Negotiation Exhausted:**  We've gone through several rounds of offers and counteroffers, and it seems unlikely that we'll reach a significantly higher price.
* **Risk of Losing Bob:**  If I reject Bob's offer again, there's a risk he might walk away completely, leaving me with no buyer except John.  Accepting ensures I get a good price and secure a sale."
