"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to consider a reasonable price.  How does $1,200,000 sound?  This would give you a great deal, and still leave me with a good return. ",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let's make a deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $850,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and still allows us to make this a win-win deal.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. ",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still out of my range.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. It's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $850,000.  However,  I'm willing to make a final concession. How about $950,000? This price is a significant step down from my original offer, and I truly believe it's the best compromise we can reach.  Let's close this deal and both walk away happy.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's try to find common ground and close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,
