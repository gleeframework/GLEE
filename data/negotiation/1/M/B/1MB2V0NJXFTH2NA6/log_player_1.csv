"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to consider a reasonable price.  How does $1,200,000 sound?  This would give you a great deal, and still leave me with a good return. "", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's estimated value to give me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to build rapport with Bob.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I highlight the value of the product for Bob, making it appealing. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By suggesting it's ""a good deal"", I'm implying that I'm open to negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'm starting high to maximize my potential profits. If Bob rejects the offer, I can use the remaining rounds to negotiate down, but always keeping in mind that I have the option of selling to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let's make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  $850,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I still have 8 rounds left to negotiate.  There's a good chance I can get a better offer from Bob or reach a compromise.
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I have the option of selling to John for $1,000,000, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low price.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm maintaining my bargaining position. I'll use the next round to make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $850,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and still allows us to make this a win-win deal.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Smaller Drop:** I'm lowering my price, but only by a small amount ($50,000). This shows flexibility without giving away too much. 
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price point.
* **Focus on Win-Win:** I'm emphasizing that reaching a compromise is in our mutual best interest. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer allows me to maintain a strong negotiating position while showing that I'm willing to be reasonable. I'm aiming to get closer to my desired price and explore if Bob is willing to budge further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still out of my range.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. It's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Inflexibility:** Bob is sticking to his initial offer, which is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Time Remaining:** I still have 6 rounds left, giving me ample time to continue negotiating.
* **John's Offer as a Backstop:**  I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob fail. 

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open.  I'll try to find a compromise that's closer to my price in the next round. I might also try a different strategy like emphasizing the unique value of the product to Bob or highlighting potential benefits he might be overlooking."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $850,000.  However,  I'm willing to make a final concession. How about $950,000? This price is a significant step down from my original offer, and I truly believe it's the best compromise we can reach.  Let's close this deal and both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:** This counteroffer shows that I'm flexible but still holding firm on my price. It's a significant drop from my previous offer, making it appear more attractive to Bob.
* **Emphasizing Compromise:** I emphasize that this is a final concession to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Positive Outlook:** I use a positive tone to create a sense of urgency and encourage a quick agreement.

**Strategy:**

This offer is a strategic move to test Bob's willingness to compromise.  I'm aiming for a price that is acceptable to both of us and allows us to conclude the deal. If Bob still rejects this offer, I will have a clearer understanding of his bottom line and can decide whether to continue negotiating or accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's try to find common ground and close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Progress:** Bob has increased his offer to $900,000, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Limited Time:** We only have 4 rounds left, and it's unlikely that Bob will significantly increase his offer further.
* **Minimizing Risk:** Accepting this offer guarantees me a profit of $900,000, which is better than selling to John for $1,000,000 and risking further negotiations with Bob potentially failing.

**Strategy:**

By accepting this offer, I am maximizing my potential earnings within the given constraints of the negotiation.  I am taking a calculated risk by closing the deal now rather than pushing for a higher price and potentially risking the deal falling through."
