"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but  $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000.  I believe that's a fair price that reflects its worth while leaving room for you to make a reasonable profit.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1,200,000 is significantly below my initial assessment, I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,450,000. This price still reflects the value of the product while allowing for a fair negotiation.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit.  However,  $1,450,000 is still more than I'd like to spend. Would you consider $1,300,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a solution.  While $1,300,000 is still below what I feel is fair, I'm willing to make one final concession.  Let's split the difference at $1,375,000. This price allows us to both secure a favorable deal.  I'm hopeful this will be acceptable to you.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
