"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I believe it's worth a lot to you, so I'm offering it to you first. How does $130 sound? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price.  He has a clear upper limit of $150, so there's room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you reaching out first. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $100?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm looking for something a bit closer to my original price. How about we meet in the middle at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, and $115 is a good deal considering Bob's maximum willingness to pay is $150.  There's a risk of further negotiation, but the potential savings are small compared to the risk of losing the deal entirely."
