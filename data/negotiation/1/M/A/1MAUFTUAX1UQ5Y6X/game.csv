"I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000 for the product.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'd like to offer $750,000 for it.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on it, and I believe it gives us both a good opportunity to make a deal.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer of $750,000, Bob, but I'm afraid I was hoping for a better price. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and gives you a good deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $950,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $825,000, which is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and your desired profit margin. Let's meet in the middle and get this deal done.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob, but $825,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to compromise at $925,000. I believe this price reflects the product's worth and gives you a good deal, while also allowing me to meet my minimum requirements.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $925,000 is still a bit above my target.  To close this deal, I'm offering $875,000. This is a fair price that's closer to my limit and still allows you a comfortable profit. Let's work together to reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make one more significant concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $975,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth.",975000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concerns, but $975,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. To finalize this deal, I'm offering $900,000. It's a good compromise for both of us, and we can finally move forward. I'm confident this is a fair price considering your desired profit and the value I place on the product. Let's make this happen.",900000.0,Bob,8,
