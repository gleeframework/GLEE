"I understand you're interested in the product, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $11,000 for it. How about we compromise at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,500? This would give you a good profit and leave me with some room to work with.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I think the product's value is higher than $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $11,000, which would be $10,250. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",10250.0,Alice,5,
