Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're interested in the product, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $11,000 for it. How about we compromise at $11,000?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,500? This would give you a good profit and leave me with some room to work with."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I think the product's value is higher than $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $11,000, which would be $10,250. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000. While Alice's offer of $10,250 is closer to his budget than previous offers, it's still above his maximum of $8,000.  John is offering a price that fits within Bob's budget, and there's no guarantee that further negotiations with Alice will result in a lower price."
