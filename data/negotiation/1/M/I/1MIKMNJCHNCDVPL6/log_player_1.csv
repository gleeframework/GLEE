"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's valued at over $1 million to me, but I believe it's worth even more to you.  I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $950000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate and can still potentially get a better price. Selling to John immediately would guarantee me $1,000,000, but I believe I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,000,000.  How about $1,050,000? This would still leave you with a substantial profit."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1000000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has offered my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While I'd prefer to get more, there's no guarantee I'll do better in future rounds.  Accepting this offer guarantees me my minimum goal and avoids any risk of further negotiation."
