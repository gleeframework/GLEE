Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. Please let me know your decision soon, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can aim higher with Bob. Starting at $1,450,000 allows room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""value and potential"" subtly justifies the high price without explicitly revealing your bottom line.
* **Time Pressure:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**This strategy aims to:**

1. **Maximize profit:**  If Bob accepts, you earn a significant profit above your minimum.
2. **Maintain the option of John:** If Bob rejects the offer, you can still sell to John at your desired price."
