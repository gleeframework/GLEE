"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $800,000. What are your thoughts?",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $800,000 is a good starting point, I'd like to propose $700,000.  I believe this price reflects the value I see in the product, and it allows for a fair deal for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I believe the product's value justifies a slightly higher price. What are your thoughts?",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $750,000 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit higher than where I'd like to be.  I'm willing to go to $725,000. This feels like a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while still allowing us both to walk away satisfied.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $725,000, so I'm proposing $737,500. This is my final offer in this range, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",737500.0,Alice,5,
