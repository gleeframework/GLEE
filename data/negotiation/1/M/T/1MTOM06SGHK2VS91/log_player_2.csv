"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $800,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.**  $800,000 is a significant discount from the product's value to Alice, but there's still room for negotiation. 
* **There's no urgency to accept.**  You have 10 rounds and an alternative option in John. It makes sense to explore if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $800,000 is a good starting point, I'd like to propose $700,000.  I believe this price reflects the value I see in the product, and it allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I believe the product's value justifies a slightly higher price. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is better, but still has room for improvement.**  $750,000 is closer to your desired price, but you're still saving a significant amount.
* **There's no immediate pressure to accept.** You have several rounds remaining and a backup option in John. 
* **Further negotiation could lead to a lower price.** Pushing for a price closer to $700,000 could yield a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $750,000 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit higher than where I'd like to be.  I'm willing to go to $725,000. This feels like a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while still allowing us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 725000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $725,000, so I'm proposing $737,500. This is my final offer in this range, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $737,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $737,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is very close to your desired price.**  $737,500 is only $12,500 higher than your last counteroffer.
* **Alice has signaled this is her final offer in this range.**  Further negotiation may not result in a significantly lower price.
* **You're saving a substantial amount.**  You're getting the product for $262,500 less than John's price. 
* **Time is valuable.**  Accepting now secures the deal and leaves you with more time to potentially use the product."
