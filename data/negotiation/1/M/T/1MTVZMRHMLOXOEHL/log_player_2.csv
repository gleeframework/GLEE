"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $95
* **Your Value:** $120 
* **Alice's Value:** $80

Accepting Alice's offer means you get the product for $95, saving $25 compared to buying from John. While you could potentially negotiate further with Alice, the risk of her rejecting your counteroffer and forcing you to buy from John for $120 isn't worth it."
