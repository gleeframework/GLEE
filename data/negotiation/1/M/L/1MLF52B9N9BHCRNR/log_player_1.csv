"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm offering it to you at $2,250,000. I believe this price reflects its worth and the benefits it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We're beginning with a price significantly higher than our minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This allows room for negotiation and creates the impression that the product is highly valuable. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""immense value and potential,"" we provide a reason for the high price without revealing specific details.
* **Leaving Room for Bob:** By explicitly stating our belief in the price's fairness, we subtly encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation rather than dismissing the offer outright.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's Interest:** His reaction will tell us how much he values the product and how willing he is to negotiate.
2. **Maximize Profit Potential:**  We're starting high to aim for the best possible deal.
3. **Control the Negotiation:** By making the first move, we set the tone and direction of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2,250,000 price. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,875,000? This would allow me to potentially acquire the product while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,875,000 is a significant jump from his perceived value of $1,000,000. This indicates strong interest in the product and room for further negotiation. While accepting would secure a profit, it's too early to settle. We can likely negotiate a higher price by strategically countering. 

Selling to John for $1,500,000 is our safety net, but we are aiming higher with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is generous, the value this product brings is truly exceptional. How about we meet halfway at $2,062,500? This reflects my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 2062500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're meeting Bob halfway between our previous offer ($2,250,000) and his counteroffer ($1,875,000). This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise while still aiming high.
* **Emphasis on Value:** We're subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth by using phrases like ""truly exceptional"" and ""mutually beneficial agreement.""
* **Maintaining Control:** By proposing a specific price, we guide the negotiation and avoid a stalemate where Bob might expect further concessions without offering any himself. 

This counteroffer aims to:

1. **Encourage Movement:** It prompts Bob to either make a more competitive offer or justify his position further.
2. **Maintain Momentum:** It keeps the negotiation moving forward without conceding too much too quickly. 
3. **Work Towards a Favorable Outcome:** Our goal remains to secure a price significantly above both our minimum and Bob's initial perception of the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but unfortunately, I still can't meet the $2,062,500 price. I propose $1,950,000 as a compromise. This allows us to stay closer to my budget while still acknowledging the product's worth. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum acceptable price, but we still have room to negotiate. He's incrementally increasing his offers, showing serious interest and suggesting he might be willing to go even higher.  

We are still in early rounds, and walking away with John's offer would be settling for a lower profit when a higher one seems attainable with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. It's clear you recognize the unique nature of this product.  To find a compromise, I'm willing to come down to $2,006,250. This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 2006250
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** We're making a smaller concession this round ($56,250) compared to the previous round ($106,250) to signal we're reaching our lower limit. 
* **Highlighting Compromise:** We're explicitly stating this is a ""significant reduction"" to emphasize our flexibility and encourage Bob to reciprocate.
* **""Fair Deal"" Language:** By framing the offer as fair, we aim to nudge Bob towards accepting rather than engaging in a prolonged back-and-forth.

The goal here is to keep the negotiation moving while applying subtle pressure. We're balancing Bob's clear interest with our aim to maximize profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I still feel that the product's asking price is slightly above what I'm comfortable with. I'd like to propose $1,900,000 as a fair compromise. This allows us to move closer to my budget while respecting the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,900,000 is a significant profit above our minimum of $1,500,000. While we could try to push for more in the remaining rounds, there's a risk that:

* **Bob might walk away:**  We've reached a point where the negotiation could stall, and pushing too hard might make Bob reconsider the deal altogether.
* **Opportunity cost:** Continuing the negotiation means we might miss out on other potential buyers or opportunities. 

Accepting now secures a very favorable outcome and avoids the risk of ending up with a lower offer or no deal at all."
