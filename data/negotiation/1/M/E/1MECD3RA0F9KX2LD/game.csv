"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant return on investment you'll see.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $800,000.  This is a fair price, considering my budget and the value I see in this product.  Let's work together to make this deal happen.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and potential for generating revenue.  To move this forward, I can come down to $2,000,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my willingness to negotiate.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $2,000,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $800,000. This is a fair price, considering the value I place on the product and the significant cost savings it offers you compared to the alternative of selling to John. Let's find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but the gap between our valuations remains substantial. I'm willing to make a significant move to bridge this gap, but I need to see some flexibility on your end as well. I'm proposing a price of $1,700,000. This is a major concession on my part, and I believe it represents a fair compromise.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000, which demonstrates my genuine interest in this product. This represents a significant increase on my initial offer and a fair compromise, considering the value we both place on this product. Let's work together to bridge this remaining gap.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase with your increased offer.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last positions. I'll come down to $1,350,000 if we can close the deal now. This is my final offer.",1350000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,350,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a significant increase on my last offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise, considering the value we both place on this product. Let's close this deal now and avoid further negotiation.",1100000.0,Bob,8,
