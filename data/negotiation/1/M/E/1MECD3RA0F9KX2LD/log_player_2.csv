Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and potential for generating revenue.  To move this forward, I can come down to $2,000,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my willingness to negotiate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is still too high.  While she's shown some willingness to negotiate, $2,000,000 is still well above your budget. Rejecting the offer and continuing to counteroffer is the best strategy for now."

Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the gap between our valuations remains substantial. I'm willing to make a significant move to bridge this gap, but I need to see some flexibility on your end as well. I'm proposing a price of $1,700,000. This is a major concession on my part, and I believe it represents a fair compromise.
