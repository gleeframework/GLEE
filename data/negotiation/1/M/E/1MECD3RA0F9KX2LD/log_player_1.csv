"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $800,000.  This is a fair price, considering my budget and the value I see in this product.  Let's work together to make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and potential for generating revenue.  To move this forward, I can come down to $2,000,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my willingness to negotiate."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $2,000,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $800,000. This is a fair price, considering the value I place on the product and the significant cost savings it offers you compared to the alternative of selling to John. Let's find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is holding firm at a price far below the product's value. While accepting his offer is tempting for a quick sale, it represents a significant loss compared to selling to John.  Continuing negotiations allows for the possibility of reaching a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but the gap between our valuations remains substantial. I'm willing to make a significant move to bridge this gap, but I need to see some flexibility on your end as well. I'm proposing a price of $1,700,000. This is a major concession on my part, and I believe it represents a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000, which demonstrates my genuine interest in this product. This represents a significant increase on my initial offer and a fair compromise, considering the value we both place on this product. Let's work together to bridge this remaining gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer has increased, it's still significantly below John's standing offer. We're getting closer, but there's potential for Bob to go higher, especially with fewer rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase with your increased offer.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last positions. I'll come down to $1,350,000 if we can close the deal now. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** With only four rounds left, it's time to apply pressure and signal a firm stance. 
* **Meeting Halfway:**  This shows a willingness to compromise but also maintains a strong position above both Bob's current offer and John's guaranteed price.
* **Final Offer:** Creates urgency and may prompt Bob to make his best move, revealing how much he truly values the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,350,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a significant increase on my last offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise, considering the value we both place on this product. Let's close this deal now and avoid further negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Upside:** While Bob's offer is improving, it's unlikely he'll reach the $1,500,000 mark within two rounds. 
* **John's Guarantee:** Selling to John eliminates further risk and guarantees the maximum value for the product. 
* **Time Value:**  Accepting John's offer avoids further negotiation effort and allows for immediate closure. 

While there's a chance Bob might increase his offer significantly in the final rounds, it's a gamble not worth taking given the guaranteed alternative with John."
