"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm taking a calculated risk.  If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value, but it's a starting point.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm moving down from my initial offer, but still keeping it significantly above Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I also believe the product is worth a lot more than $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, but it's still not ideal. I'm going to keep pushing for a better price. I'm hoping to see if I can get Bob to agree to something closer to $800,000 or at least convince him to come up to $800,000 in a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway, offering $850,000.  This is a significant concession, but it shows I'm serious about selling to Bob and  hopefully will encourage him to make a final counteroffer.  I'm also leaving a small buffer in case I need to make a final concession in the last few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now my minimum value.  I'm happy to accept it and close the deal.  It's not ideal, but it's a good outcome considering I could have settled for $800,000 from John."
