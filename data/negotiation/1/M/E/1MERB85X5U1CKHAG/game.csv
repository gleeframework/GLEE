"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you seeing the value in this product. However, $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to consider $12,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to get the product and you to still make a profit.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, $12,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $16,000, which is $14,000. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",14000.0,Alice,5,
