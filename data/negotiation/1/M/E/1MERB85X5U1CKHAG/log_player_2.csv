You have three options:

The product is worth $15,000 to Alice and $8,000 to Bob. Alice's offer of $20,000 is too high. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,000. What do you think?

While $16,000 is a better offer than Alice's initial price, it's still more than what Bob is willing to pay. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to consider $12,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to get the product and you to still make a profit."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, $12,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $16,000, which is $14,000. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still above Bob's budget.  Since Bob has a guaranteed option to purchase the product from John for $8,000, he should choose that option and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
