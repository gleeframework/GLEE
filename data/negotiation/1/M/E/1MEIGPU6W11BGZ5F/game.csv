"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to own a product that is worth a lot to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the price.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price is fair for both of us, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $925,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in the product while remaining within my budget.  I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $875,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer it to you for $900,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is a final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,5,
