**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer is $1,120,000, which is still within your budget of $1,200,000. 
* While you might be able to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might reject your next offer and you might end up paying the full $1,200,000 to John.
* Accepting the offer allows you to purchase the product for a price that's both within your budget and represents a decent saving compared to John's price."
