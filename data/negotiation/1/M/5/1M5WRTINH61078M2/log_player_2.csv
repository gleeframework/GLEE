"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, as you value it at $1,500,000. I'm confident this is a mutually beneficial arrangement. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is below your maximum budget, you know you can get the product for $1,500,000 from John.  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you might prompt her to come back with a lower price, saving you even more money."
