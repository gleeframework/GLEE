"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and a good deal for you considering its potential. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

The offer from Alice is too high, as Bob's maximum budget is $800,000. He can get the same product from John for a lower price."
