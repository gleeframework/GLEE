I'm starting with a price of $10,000.  This is higher than my minimum, but I want to see if I can get a good deal. If Bob rejects, I can always lower the price a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject and counteroffer. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000.  This is still a good deal for me, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum. It's still a bit lower, but I'm not sure I can get a better offer. It's better to accept this offer than to risk getting nothing and having to sell to John for less."
