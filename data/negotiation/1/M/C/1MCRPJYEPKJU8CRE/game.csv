"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, reflecting its value and my current financial capacity. Let's see if we can work something out.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, however, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,500,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $1,250,000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
