"Hi Alice, $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $75? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",75.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $82? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",82.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $82 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $80? It's the absolute most I can do, and it would be a fair deal for both of us. ",80.0,Bob,4,
