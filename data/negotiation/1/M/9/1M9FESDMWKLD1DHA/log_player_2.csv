"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that's worth a great deal to me, and I believe it could be very valuable to you as well. I'm asking for $20000 for it, but I'm confident it's a price that reflects its true worth. If you're interested, let's discuss further. If not, I have another buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000.
