"That's a bit higher than I was hoping for.  While I'm interested in the product, I can't go higher than $12000.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me. How about $13000? I'm really interested in the product, but that's the most I can afford right now.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13000. I'm willing to meet you at $13500. This is my final offer in this range",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not quite there. While I understand this is your final offer in this range,  I'm really pushing my budget here.  Could you consider $13000?  I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've already told you that I won't go below $13500, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $13200. This is my last offer, Bob. If you don't take it, I'll have to consider other options",13200.0,Alice,7,
