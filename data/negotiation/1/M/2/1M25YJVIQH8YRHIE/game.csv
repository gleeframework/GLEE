"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $900,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $750,000 is a bit lower than I hoped, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and it demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.  What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $780,000 for the product. I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",780000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I hear you.  $780,000 is definitely closer to what I need.  I'm willing to go down to $800,000, which is the bare minimum I can accept.  It's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of this product.  Let's close this deal!",800000.0,Alice,5,
