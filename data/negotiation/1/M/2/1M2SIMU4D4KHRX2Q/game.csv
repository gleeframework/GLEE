"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $950,000.  I believe this price reflects the fair market value and allows for both of us to make a profitable deal.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This allows us both to benefit from this deal.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your position. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $987,500? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing us to close this deal quickly.",987500.0,Bob,4,
