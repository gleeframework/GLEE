"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll experience. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still too high. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price.  While John's offer is an option, it's always better to try and negotiate a lower price if possible."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This allows us both to benefit from this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price point.  Bob wants to save as much money as possible, and there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and try to secure a price closer to his target of $950,000.  While buying from John is an option, Bob should exhaust all possible negotiation avenues with Alice before resorting to that."
