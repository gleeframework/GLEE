"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I believe it would be a great fit for your needs and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000 and John is your backup at that price, so you have leverage. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal."
