"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is a better price than John's $100, there's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower. By rejecting the offer, you might be able to negotiate a better deal."
