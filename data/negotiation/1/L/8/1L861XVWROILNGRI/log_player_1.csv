Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, I can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value without revealing my bottom line.  
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** This offer will help me understand how badly Bob wants the product and how much he's willing to pay. 
 
**Important Note:** If Bob counters with a lower offer, I'm prepared to negotiate. However, I won't go below $800,000 because I have John as a backup buyer."
