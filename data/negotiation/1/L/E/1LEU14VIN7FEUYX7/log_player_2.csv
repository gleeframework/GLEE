"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product at a price that reflects its worth. I believe $1100000 is a fair starting point, considering the significant value it holds for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000. Would you consider a price of $1,050,000? It's a significant amount for me, and hopefully, a good starting point for us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $1075000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it still reflects the value I know this product holds for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,075,000 is still above your ideal price point.  You've demonstrated a willingness to negotiate, and there's still room to move closer to your target.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and potentially allows for a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,075,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference. How about $1,062,500? This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1062500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about $1070000? I'm confident this price reflects the value you'll derive from the product, and it's a fair compromise for both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,070,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to your target price, $1,070,000 is still above your desired amount.  You have a few more rounds to negotiate, and you can likely get a slightly lower price.  Rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Alice to come down further."
