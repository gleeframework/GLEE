I'll reject Bob's offer. I believe I can get more than $15,000. I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}

I'll offer Bob $18,000 for the product.  It's a compromise from my initial price, but still higher than his offer. I hope this will encourage him to continue negotiations."

I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $16,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal and higher than selling to John.  I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by continuing to negotiate."
