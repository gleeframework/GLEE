"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,450,000 is a better deal than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  This is a firm offer, and it's unlikely Alice will accept it immediately.  However, it establishes my willingness to negotiate and sets a clear boundary for the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still above my maximum budget.  While it's closer than her previous offer, I'm still willing to negotiate further to try and get a better deal.  I'm confident that with a counteroffer, I can push the price lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $1,100,000. This is a significant step up from my previous offer, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but still below her current price. This should make it more tempting for Alice to accept, especially since she's already rejected my previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still above my maximum budget.  At this point, the negotiation seems to be getting more difficult.  While I could continue, I'm concerned that Alice might be unwilling to budge further.  It's better to secure the product from John at my maximum budget than risk another counteroffer and potentially lose the opportunity."
