"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is good, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, Bob can still potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting allows for another round of negotiation, potentially pushing the price down further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go down to $1,325,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,362,500. It's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,362,500.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,362,500 is a good deal for Bob. It's a significant saving compared to John's price of $1,500,000, and it's only slightly higher than Bob's last counteroffer.  Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of Alice rejecting a lower offer and the opportunity cost of dealing with John makes accepting a good option."
