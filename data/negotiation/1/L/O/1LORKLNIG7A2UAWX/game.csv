"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $950,000. This is a significant investment for you, but I'm confident it will generate a strong return.  Let's find a middle ground and get this deal done.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $950,000, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $920,000. Let's see if we can make a deal.",920000.0,Bob,4,
