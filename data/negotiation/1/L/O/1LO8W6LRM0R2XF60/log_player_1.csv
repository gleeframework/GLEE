Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $11,500. I think it could be very valuable to you and this is a fair price."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($10,000) as possible without going below her own minimum ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, while still ensuring Alice makes a good profit.
* **Time Value of Money:** While John offers a guaranteed $12,000, selling to Bob quickly might be preferable even at a slightly lower price."
