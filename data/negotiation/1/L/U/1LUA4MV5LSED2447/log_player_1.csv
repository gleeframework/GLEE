Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value of the product but lower than what you'd get from John. This maximizes your potential gain while still keeping Bob in the negotiation.  If he rejects, you can move on to John and still make a good profit."
