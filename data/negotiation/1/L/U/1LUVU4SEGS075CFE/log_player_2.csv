"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $120 to you, right? I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is significantly lower than your maximum but still leaves room for negotiation. You should counter-offer with a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 feels a bit high for me.  Would you consider $85?"",
 ""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low but Reasonable:** This counter-offer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still above her perceived value of the product ($80).
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  There's space to negotiate upwards towards a price that works for both parties. 
* **Polite and Conversational:** Maintaining a positive tone helps foster a good negotiating environment."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you being interested in the product. While $85 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. Would you consider $95? It's a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is negotiating but still leaving room for us to get a better price. While $95 is closer to our desired range, we can likely get it lower with another counter-offer.  We're still significantly below our ""buy from John"" price, so it's worth another round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?  That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
 ""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This counter-offer shows willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Still Below Budget:**  $90 keeps us comfortably below our maximum budget and allows for a potential final concession if needed. 
* **Direct and Clear:**  We're directly stating a price that works for us, keeping the negotiation moving forward."
