"Alice, thank you for your offer, but $20000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the value you've placed on it, I'd be willing to pay $17500. This feels like a fair price for both of us.",17500.0,Bob,2,,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $19000. It's a fair price considering the value I've placed on the product, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think?",19000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a certain price, but $19000 is still a bit higher than I can go.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $17500. This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",17500.0,Bob,4,,
