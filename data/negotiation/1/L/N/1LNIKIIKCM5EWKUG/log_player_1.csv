Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product for $1,450,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering the value we both place on it.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him some room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This allows for some potential negotiation while still securing a profit for you.
* **It's not too far off from your minimum:** This avoids starting the negotiation with an aggressive offer that might immediately lead to a rejection. 

By starting with this offer, you create space for a back-and-forth negotiation while ensuring you can still secure a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Could you do  $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While you can still make a profit, it's not nearly as high as you could potentially get.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired value. You can try to negotiate further with Bob and potentially close a deal closer to $1,400,000, which would be a more satisfying outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,100,000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This still leaves room for both of us to gain from the deal.  Let me know if you're interested in this offer."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meet Bob halfway:** Your counteroffer is a significant compromise from your original price but still higher than Bob's offer. This shows you're willing to negotiate while still maintaining a profitable outcome. 
* **Maintain a higher profit:** $1,300,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's offer and closer to your desired price point. This gives you a better chance of a more satisfying sale. 
* **Frame it positively:** The message emphasizes the mutual benefit of the deal, increasing the chances of Bob accepting your offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? That's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is still below my ideal price, it's a fair compromise.  I can make a profit, and Bob is willing to pay his perceived value.  

* **Avoid further negotiation:**  Continuing to haggle with Bob might lead to a stalemate or a lower offer. 
* **Secure a quick sale:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick transaction and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether.

Selling to John would be more profitable, but it involves the risk of Bob eventually offering a higher price.  Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale while avoiding that risk."
