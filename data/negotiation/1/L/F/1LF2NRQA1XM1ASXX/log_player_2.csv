Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. Considering the value of our product and the market conditions, we are proposing a final offer of $575000. We believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our needs and your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $575,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $575,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $575,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's well within his budget, and considering the possibility of John's price being the only other option, it's a solid compromise. It's more likely that continuing to negotiate will only lead to more rounds and a potential stalemate."
