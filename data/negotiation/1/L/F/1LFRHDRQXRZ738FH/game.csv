"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be extremely valuable to your business. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it holds the same value for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,050,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,1,
