Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. Let me know your decision, as I have another interested buyer waiting."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 (John), you have significant leverage to start high with Bob. 
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly reveal the product's value to Bob, it emphasizes its ""immense value and potential,"" subtly justifying the high price. 
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** Mentioning another interested buyer creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price. 

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation strategy. Ideally, you'd want to gather more information about Bob's willingness to pay and adjust your offer accordingly in a real-world scenario."
