"Hi Alice, $250 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in your product but my budget is closer to $100. Would you be willing to consider that?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $175. Is that something you'd be interested in?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $175 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $150? That's a fair price for both of us.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to meet me at $150, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. However, I can throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium service package that's worth $25. So, the total price would be $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,5,
