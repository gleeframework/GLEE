"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This is a bold opening offer that leaves room for negotiation. If Bob is truly interested, he might counter, giving us a starting point for a back-and-forth. If he rejects outright, I'll have to adjust my strategy and consider the option of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm not willing to accept that. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate, but still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping this will be a more attractive offer for Bob, and we can start to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $700,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not willing to sell for that amount. I have a few more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and I believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

I'm offering $850,000. This is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's willingness to pay more, but still within my acceptable range. With only 5 rounds left, I'm pushing for a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I have 4 rounds left, so I'll continue negotiating with Bob. I believe there's still room for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}
```

I'm going to counter with $825,000. This is a smaller reduction from my previous offer, showing that I'm firm in my price expectations, while still leaving some room for negotiation. We're getting close to my minimum price, and I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal."
