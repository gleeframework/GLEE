"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but it still leaves room for negotiation.  Bob values the product at $10,000, so this price is within his range, giving him incentive to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal. Bob values the product at $10,000, so there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering with $9,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves me with a profit greater than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  It also demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still trying to secure a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,750 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, and I'm running out of time. It's likely that further negotiation won't lead to a significantly higher price, and accepting this offer guarantees me a profit.  Selling to John for $8,000 would be less profitable, so accepting Bob's offer is the best option in this round."
