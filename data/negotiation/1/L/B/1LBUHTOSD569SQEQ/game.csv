"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $18000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $14000 right now.  Let me know if you're willing to negotiate.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $14000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16500. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $16500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $15250?  I'm really interested in the product and think this price is fair for both of us.",15250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,5,
