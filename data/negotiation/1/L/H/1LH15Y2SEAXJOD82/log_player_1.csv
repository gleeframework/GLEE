"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. My asking price is $170, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum value ($150) but leaving room for negotiation. This will hopefully entice Bob to make a counteroffer and start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $120. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is below my minimum, I won't sell it for that price. It's worth more to me. I'll try to counter-offer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140, given the value of this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm dropping the price slightly but staying above my minimum value. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I still believe we could find common ground. Could you possibly go down to $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer, $130 is still below my minimum. I'm going to counteroffer again and try to squeeze out a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement here.  How about we split the difference and I go down to $135? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm trying to meet Bob halfway by dropping my price to $135.  This is still above my minimum, but it shows a willingness to compromise. Hopefully, this will be enough to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I think $130 would be a fair price for both of us. Could you please match this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached the point where I'm starting to feel like I'm not going to get a better price from Bob. He's stubborn on his $130 offer, and I'm not willing to go that low. To ensure I get at least my minimum value, I'm going to sell the product to John."
