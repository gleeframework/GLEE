"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) but lower than John's offer ($150) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm hinting at the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, I believe we can come to an agreement that's fair for both of us. Would you consider selling the product for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob to reach a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage and demonstrate my willingness to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm offering a counter-offer that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum price.
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a justification for my counter-offer, highlighting the product's value and emphasizing my desire for a fair deal.
* **Negotiation Mindset:** I'm framing the counter-offer as a way to ""find a middle ground,"" which encourages further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the product's value and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $140. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $140 is just below my minimum desired price of $150.
* **Time Factor:**  We are already in round 4, and I don't want to risk losing Bob as a buyer and having to settle with John for $150.
* **Potential for Future Deals:** Even if I'm not getting my ideal price, accepting this offer might allow me to build a relationship with Bob for potential future sales."
