"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I think $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to consider a price of $15,000. Can you meet me halfway?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but this product offers significant value that even surpasses $15,000. How about we settle on $18,000? It's a fair compromise that reflects the product's true worth.",18000.0,Alice,3,
