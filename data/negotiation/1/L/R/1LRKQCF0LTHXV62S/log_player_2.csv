"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  $12,000 is still a lot more than the product's worth to Alice, so there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a low counteroffer of $9,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above the product's worth to Alice. This shows Bob is serious about negotiating but also willing to compromise. It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above the product's worth to Alice and leaves room for further negotiation. Bob should continue to negotiate, aiming for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering $10,000, which is the product's worth to Alice. This is a fair offer and a good compromise. It shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also trying to get the best possible price. It's likely Alice will accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and potentially losing the deal altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's tempting to accept and avoid further negotiation, Bob can likely secure a better price.  There are still 5 rounds left, which provides enough time to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer to $11,000. This is a compromise, showing he is willing to meet Alice halfway. It's still a good deal for Bob, as it's significantly lower than Alice's last offer and closer to the product's worth to Alice.  This might incentivize Alice to accept the offer before potentially losing the deal in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is increasing her price again, and it's getting close to the point where it's no longer worth it for Bob to keep negotiating. He's already rejected a few offers, and Alice is showing she's willing to hold out for a higher price. With only 3 rounds remaining, there's a high risk that Alice won't budge, and Bob might end up paying more than he wants. Buying from John for $15,000 ensures Bob gets the product and avoids further negotiation with Alice, who seems stubborn."
