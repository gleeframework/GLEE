"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal for both of us - you get a fantastic product at a lower price, and I get a good return on my investment. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Even though Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to her ($8,000), it's still lower than what John is selling it for ($10,000).
* **Saving money is the goal:**  As Bob, the goal is to save money. Accepting Alice's offer saves $500 compared to buying from John."
