"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $7,500,  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $8,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but I also have a minimum price I need to meet. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still sticking to my initial offer of $7,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to continue negotiating with Bob, it seems like we're at an impasse.  He's firm on his $7,500 offer, and I'm not willing to go that low.  To guarantee I get at least $8,000, I'll sell to John."
