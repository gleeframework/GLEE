"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $12,000.
* Alice is offering the product at your maximum price. 
* You have another seller (John) who will sell the product at the same price.

Therefore, there's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer. You can get the same product from John."
