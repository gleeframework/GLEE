"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value and features, I'm proposing a starting price of $16,000.  I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair offer."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. I'm willing to negotiate, but $10,000 is significantly below its true worth. How about we meet halfway at $13,000? This reflects the product's value while still offering you a competitive price."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $13,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to move much higher than $11,000.  While we could continue negotiating, accepting John's offer guarantees our minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and avoids the risk of Bob not increasing his offer sufficiently."
