{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $135. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $135, which is above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate while still being appealing to Bob.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is friendly and focuses on the benefits for both of us, making it more likely for Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for negotiation by not being too aggressive with my initial price.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* If the negotiation stalls or becomes unproductive, I'll switch to selling to John for the guaranteed $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $125 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I show him I'm serious about getting a fair price. This also opens up the opportunity for me to counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my desired $135.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price between $125 and $135. 
* I'll carefully consider how much I'm willing to compromise to avoid risking a deal with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm open to negotiation, $125 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $130? This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm hoping to get."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing $130, which is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $135 and Bob's offer of $125. This shows a willingness to compromise while still ensuring I get a decent profit.
* **Emphasizing Value:** My message highlights the value proposition for Bob by calling it a ""good deal"" for him.
* **Maintaining Negotiation Flexibility:**  While I'm pushing for $130, I'm leaving room for further negotiation if Bob rejects this offer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, counteroffer again, or switch to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $130 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $125? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob's offer of $125 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150, even with his explanation about his budget. This suggests further negotiation is unlikely to yield a more favorable result.
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:**  Selling to John for $150 guarantees me the highest profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob.  

**Next Steps:**

* I will proceed with the sale to John to ensure a secure and profitable outcome."
