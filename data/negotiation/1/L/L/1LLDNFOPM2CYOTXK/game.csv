Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?,12000.0,Alice,1,,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I can't accept your offer of $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,9500.0
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $11000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my previous offer and your new offer, so I'll make a counteroffer of $9500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Bob,4,,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $10800. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations so far. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,9500.0
"I'm not willing to go any higher than $9500. I think that's a fair price considering the negotiations we've had so far. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $15000. Is $9500 a price you're willing to accept?",9500.0,Bob,6,,
