"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is reflective of the significant return on investment you'll see."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning the negotiation significantly above both my minimum price and Bob's perceived value. This allows room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product is highly valuable.
* **Justification:**  I'm not just throwing out a number, I'm framing it with the product's ""unique value"" and ""potential return on investment."" This aims to get Bob thinking about the potential upside. 
* **Leaving Room for John:**  While I'm aiming high, I'm aware I have John as a backup. This knowledge gives me the confidence to start high and negotiate strategically over the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm still evaluating the product's value. Considering its worth to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer $1,150,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering my budget and the product's potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, especially knowing I have John as a backup. I'll use Bob's comment about meeting ""halfway"" as a starting point for my counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I understand your perspective, but the halfway point doesn't quite reflect the full value this product brings.  Let's meet closer to the middle ground. I'm proposing $1,900,000."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm acknowledging Bob's attempt to find a compromise but standing firm on a significantly higher price. 
* **Anchoring:** By proposing $1,900,000, I'm anchoring the negotiation closer to my desired range.  
* **Justification:** I'm using softer language (""closer to the middle ground"") to make the counteroffer seem more reasonable while still pushing for a strong price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to meet you at $1,700,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Bob is clearly willing to negotiate and has significantly increased his offer. 
* **Room for More:** However, $1,700,000 is still below my minimum. Given his concessions so far, I believe there's still room for him to move closer to my target range. 
* **Time Considerations:** We still have several rounds left, and I'm not feeling pressured to accept a suboptimal offer. I'm willing to continue negotiating strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Your latest offer demonstrates serious interest, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle at $1,825,000? This reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your investment."",
""product_price"": 1825000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to foster a good negotiating relationship. 
* **Strategic Compromise:**  I'm splitting the difference between his previous offer ($1,700,000) and my last counteroffer ($1,900,000). This shows flexibility while still aiming high.
* **Value Focus:** I'm continuing to reiterate the product's value, subtly anchoring Bob's perception above his initial assessment. 
* **Time Management:**  As we're approaching the halfway point, this offer encourages Bob to move closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you at $1,750,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,750,000 is a substantial amount and represents a significant profit over my minimum. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While I could potentially push for more in subsequent rounds, the gains are likely to be incremental at this point. Bob's concessions are getting smaller.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a higher offer from Bob carries the risk that he might walk away. Accepting now secures a very good deal. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate has a time cost. Accepting this offer allows me to move on to other potential deals."
