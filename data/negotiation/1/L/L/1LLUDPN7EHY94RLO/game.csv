"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a deal that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. This product looks promising, but the price point is a little high for me at the moment. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has immense value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I propose a new price of $950,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a competitive price.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $950,000 is still a bit more than I had in mind. How about we settle at $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $875,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go much lower than that. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a price of $900,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this point.",900000.0,Alice,5,
