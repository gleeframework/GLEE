Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's room to potentially earn more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The offer price of $1,100,000 is:
    * Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000).
    * Still allows for a substantial profit for Bob if he can leverage the product effectively.
    *  Leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:**  The presence of John as a guaranteed buyer reduces the risk of aiming too high with Bob. 

This approach prioritizes maximizing potential profit while considering the buyer's perspective and leveraging the security of a backup offer."
