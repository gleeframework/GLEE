"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $175.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to see if I can get him to negotiate. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** $175 is still lower than my minimum, giving Bob some space to bargain without me feeling pressured to sell to John.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and friendly to encourage a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** While it's tempting to take $125, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob is clearly interested in the product and is willing to negotiate.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a better price.
* **Time is on my side:** I have 10 rounds and can always sell to John as a backup if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer.  While I value the product at a higher price, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $150? It's still a great deal for you, and it's a price I can work with."", ""product_price"": 150} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromising:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price to $150. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob that this is still a great deal for him at that price.
* **Clear and Concise:** My message is straightforward and avoids unnecessary fluff."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $150 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $125. It's a fair price for both of us, and it gives us a chance to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob is insistent on $125, which is significantly lower than my minimum. Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better price.
* **Time is running out:** We're already in round 4, and each round wasted increases the risk of losing John as a buyer.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring a decent profit. 

It's better to secure a guaranteed profit than risk further negotiations that might fail and leave me with a lower price or no sale at all."
