{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
This product is worth more to Alice than to me, so I can likely get it for a lower price. I'll reject her initial offer and see if I can negotiate a better deal."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your offer.  While I value the product at a higher price, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $150? It's still a great deal for you, and it's a price I can work with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice is still above my target price of $100, and I have a backup option with John. I'll keep trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $150 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $125. It's a fair price for both of us, and it gives us a chance to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 125}
