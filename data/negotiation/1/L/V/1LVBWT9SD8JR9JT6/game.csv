"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $18,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers, but I need to stay within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,4,
