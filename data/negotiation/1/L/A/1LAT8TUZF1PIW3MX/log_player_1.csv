Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I open it up to other buyers.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $16,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 16000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down a little.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""other buyers"" and ""its value,""  Alice subtly implies that the product is in demand and justifies the higher asking price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and open to discussion, encouraging Bob to counter-offer if he finds the initial price too high.

While Alice knows she has John as a backup, she aims to maximize her profit with Bob. This offer balances ambition with the understanding that Bob might negotiate."
