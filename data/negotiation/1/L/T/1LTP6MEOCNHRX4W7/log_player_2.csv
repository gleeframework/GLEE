"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your operations, potentially even more than my asking price. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is $1,400,000, which is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  Since you have 10 rounds to negotiate, it's worth rejecting the offer and seeing if you can get a lower price from Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my current budget. I'd be willing to offer $1,300,000 for it. This would still allow you a good profit while also getting me a great deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget considerations. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and I'm confident it can bring substantial returns for your business.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,375,000.  This reflects its true worth while acknowledging your offer. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,375,000 is still above my maximum budget, but I'm getting closer.  It's worth rejecting again and trying to push for a lower price, especially since we have several rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,375,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford right now. I'm happy to meet you in the middle and offer $1,350,000. This price is fair and allows both of us to walk away with a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's make this happen.  I'm willing to accept $1,360,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.  What do you say?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,360,000 is still higher than my budget, but it's getting close.  It's worth rejecting again and trying to get a lower price.  I still have 5 rounds left, and there's a chance I can get Alice to agree to my price. If she doesn't, I can still buy from John, but I want to save as much money as possible."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,360,000 is still a bit out of reach for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,350,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.  If you're not able to accept it, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
