"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

Since you are willing to pay $120 for the product, and John is selling it for that price, it makes no sense to negotiate with Alice. You can get the product for the maximum price you are willing to pay immediately from John."
