(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's always better to try and negotiate with Alice to get a lower price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This sets the stage for negotiation. It's a bold move, but it's necessary to establish a lower starting point and gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer is still above my maximum budget. While it's getting closer, I want to see if I can push for a lower price. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm incrementally increasing my offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while staying within my budget. This counteroffer is still below my maximum price from John, but it shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer is within my budget, and it's only slightly higher than John's offer. There's a chance I can push for a lower price in the next round, but it's not guaranteed.  Given the uncertainty, I'm going to accept Alice's offer to secure the product."
