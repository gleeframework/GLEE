"Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $1,900,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but the product's value is significantly higher than your offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is a very competitive price for what you're getting.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
