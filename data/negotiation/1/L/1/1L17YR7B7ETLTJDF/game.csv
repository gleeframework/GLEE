"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair price.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product. It's a fair price that reflects the benefits you'll receive. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $11,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value and quality of this product, I'm willing to come down to $12,500. That's a fair price that reflects the benefits you'll receive and allows me to move forward with the sale. Let's make this happen!",12500.0,Alice,5,
