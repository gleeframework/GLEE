{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value, giving him some room to negotiate, but it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price.  This allows for negotiation without risking a deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,100,000?  It's a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $1,050,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$1,050,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to take the deal, I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can get closer to a reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $1,150,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offers are still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  Even though it's frustrating to lose out on the potential gain from a higher price, selling to John guarantees me my desired profit. It's time to cut my losses and move on."
