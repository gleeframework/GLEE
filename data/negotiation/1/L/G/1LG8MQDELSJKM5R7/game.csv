"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value, potentially much more than $1000000. I'm confident it could be highly beneficial for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000.  This is a one-time offer, as I have another buyer lined up willing to pay $1000000.  Consider this a chance to acquire a valuable asset at a price that could potentially yield substantial returns. ",1500000.0,Alice,1,
