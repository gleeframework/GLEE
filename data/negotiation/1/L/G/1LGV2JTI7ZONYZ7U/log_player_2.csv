{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $15,000. Alice's offer of $12,000 is better than John's offer, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially get a lower price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still better than John's offer of $15,000. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject your counteroffer and you'd be stuck with John's price. Accepting Alice's offer guarantees you get the product for a price within your budget and saves you time and potential frustration."
