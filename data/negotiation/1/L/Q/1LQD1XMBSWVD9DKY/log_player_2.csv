The product is far too expensive at $2,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

I'm offering half of Alice's asking price. This is a significant discount and hopefully shows I'm serious about buying the product."

I'm increasing my offer to $1,500,000.  This is still a good deal for Alice and hopefully is closer to a price we can both agree on."

While $1,600,000 is getting closer to my budget, I'm still not willing to pay that much. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can get a lower price."
