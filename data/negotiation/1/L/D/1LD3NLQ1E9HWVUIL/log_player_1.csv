"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm a bit hesitant to pay $11,000. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
The product is worth $10,000 to me, and Bob is offering only $8,000. It's better to keep negotiating to see if I can get a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a great deal considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}

Round 4

I'm still aiming for a price closer to $10,000.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to drop my price slightly to $9,200.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great price for the product.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 9200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to pay $8,600 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,600 is still too low, and we are only halfway through the negotiation process. I've already rejected his offer twice, and he hasn't budged much.  While I could keep negotiating, there's no guarantee he'll come closer to my ideal price.  Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees me a good return, and it's less risky than continuing with Bob."
