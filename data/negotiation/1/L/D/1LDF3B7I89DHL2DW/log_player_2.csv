"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We can try to negotiate a lower price or buy from John for $120 as a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little steep for me. Could you do $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

We are starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's offer but still gives us room to negotiate upwards."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better, we're still aiming to get as close to $90 as possible. We can try one more counter-offer before considering John's deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $100 is fair, but I'm on a bit of a budget. Would you be willing to do $95? That's the best I can offer."",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

We're pushing our luck a bit here, but this offer makes it clear that $95 is our limit. It gives Alice a final chance to make a sale before we likely move to John's offer."
