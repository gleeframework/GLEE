"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to make sure it's within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a price that works for you, but $900,000 simply doesn't meet my minimum requirements. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000, which still leaves room for you to profit from this valuable product. Let's find a compromise that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,000,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
