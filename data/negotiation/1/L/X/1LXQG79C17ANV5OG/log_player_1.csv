"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're aiming for the highest possible price, even above our minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he gets us to come down.
* **Confident Tone:**  We want to convey the product's value and our belief in its worth.
* **Open to Negotiation:** We're inviting Bob's input and signaling our willingness to negotiate. 

This strategy helps us gauge Bob's interest and sets the stage for a potentially profitable negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to $1,000,000 would be a more reasonable starting point. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both our valuation and his own stated value. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. While selling to John is tempting, we still have room to negotiate with Bob and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  Let's find a middle ground â€“ how about $1,750,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection + Justification:** We clearly reject Bob's low offer, but we provide a reason, reinforcing the product's value.
* **Significant Counter:** We counter high, but not as high as our initial offer. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a strong profit.
* **""Middle Ground"" Language:**  This encourages Bob to engage in a collaborative negotiation rather than a battle of extremes."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but that price is still a bit steep for me.  How about $1,250,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now closer to his perceived value, but we're still significantly above it and below our minimum. There's room to negotiate further and potentially meet somewhere in the middle. Selling to John guarantees our minimum, but we might be able to secure a better deal with a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,250,000 is closer to the mark, I can't let this product go for less than $1,600,000. I'm confident this price reflects its real value and potential return on investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:** We recognize Bob's movement and use positive language to encourage further negotiation.
* **Firm but Fair:** We stand firm above our minimum while softening the tone to avoid appearing inflexible.
* **Highlighting Value:** We reiterate the ""return on investment"" to remind Bob of the potential benefits, justifying the higher price.

We're strategically conceding while keeping our goal in sight. This round will be crucial to gauge Bob's willingness to meet closer to our desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I need us to find a price point that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000.  That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **""Final Offer"" Signal:** Bob's language suggests this is likely his best offer, and further negotiation might be unproductive.
* **Reasonable Compromise:**  $1,350,000 is a solid profit above our minimum, and while not ideal, it's a significant amount. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing risks Bob walking away or engaging in prolonged, low-increment negotiations. Accepting now secures a good deal.

While we could push for more, the potential gain isn't worth the risk of losing Bob and having to settle for John's offer. This acceptance balances profit maximization with negotiation pragmatism."
