"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to $1,000,000 would be a more reasonable starting point. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  Let's find a middle ground â€“ how about $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but that price is still a bit steep for me.  How about $1,250,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,250,000 is closer to the mark, I can't let this product go for less than $1,600,000. I'm confident this price reflects its real value and potential return on investment for you.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I need us to find a price point that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000.  That's my final offer.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
