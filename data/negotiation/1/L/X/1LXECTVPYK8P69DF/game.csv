"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product,  $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me at this point. I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for it.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a significant gap from where I see this product's value.  Would you consider $1,050,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a good compromise, and it's getting closer to a deal that works for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $1,025,000. This offer reflects my desire to close this deal while recognizing the product's true worth.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it reflects the value of the product while allowing us to close this deal. Let's make this happen.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
