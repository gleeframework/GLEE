"I understand you're working within a budget, Bob, but I have to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. I can offer it to you for $1750000. This is my best compromise at this point. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I can do $1675000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is my final offer. What do you think?",1675000.0,Alice,5,
