"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a valuable item for a great price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000, which is a fair price considering its worth to you is $15,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, Alice's message hints that she might be willing to go lower. Rejecting her offer opens the door for a potential counter-offer closer to her $8,000 value. You can always fall back on buying from John at $15,000 if needed."
