"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still being higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I believe this is a fair offer considering Bob values the product at $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm happy to sell the product for $80, I'm not willing to accept Bob's first counteroffer. I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm lowering my price to $90. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still confident the product is worth more to Bob than $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $85 is a good compromise, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80 and closer to my desired price.  I'll accept his offer to avoid risking losing the deal altogether."
