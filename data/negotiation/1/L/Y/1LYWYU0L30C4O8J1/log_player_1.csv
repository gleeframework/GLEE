Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefit you'll gain from it."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting slightly below Bob's valuation leaves space for potential counter-offers while staying above your minimum.
* **Highlight Value:** Emphasize the product's benefits to Bob, justifying the high price.
* **Alternative Buyer:** While you have John as a backup, the focus is to secure the best deal with Bob first."
