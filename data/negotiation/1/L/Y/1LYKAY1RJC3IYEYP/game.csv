"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $175 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying at the moment. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $155. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",155.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $152.50. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",152.5,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $152.50 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $150.  This way, we both get a good deal and can close this out.",150.0,Bob,6,
