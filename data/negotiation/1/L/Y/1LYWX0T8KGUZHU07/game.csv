"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm willing to pay a fair amount, but I need it to be much closer to my budget. How about we bring the price down significantly?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $500,000 is a significant discount from the original price, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still quite a stretch for my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $650,000. This offer represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product, Bob. However, $650,000 is still below my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
