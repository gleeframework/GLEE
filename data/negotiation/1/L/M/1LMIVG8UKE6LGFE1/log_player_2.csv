"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with our premium product which we believe could greatly benefit your needs. We understand its value to you is estimated at $15,000. After careful consideration, we're offering it to you at a special introductory price of $14,000. This is an exceptional opportunity to acquire a product that is worth significantly more and tailored to meet your specific requirements. Please let us know if this offer suits your budget and preferences. We're confident it will be a valuable addition to your endeavors. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to negotiate down from your perceived value of $15,000. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away. This puts pressure on her to potentially offer a lower price closer to her own valuation of $12,000.  You still have John as a backup option at $15,000, so there's a good chance you can get a better deal than $14,000."
