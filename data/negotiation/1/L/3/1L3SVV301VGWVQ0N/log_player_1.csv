Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $15,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Value Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly mention why the price is above Bob's perceived value, it hints at additional benefits or value that Bob might be unaware of.
* **Backup Plan:** Knowing John will buy the product for $12,000 gives you leverage. You can afford to lose Bob's business if he's not willing to pay a premium. 

**Important Considerations:**

This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to:

* **Negotiate:** Bob might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide how low you're willing to go.
* **Justify your price:** Have reasons ready to explain why your product is worth the price you're asking."
