"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is my final offer, as I already have another interested buyer."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you have another interested buyer, but I'm still not convinced that $1,150,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. I'm still interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach my minimum acceptable price. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
