{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$120:** This price is a starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150), but also higher than Bob's valuation ($80). This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring I have a chance to get a better price than John's offer.
* **Message:** This message is friendly and positive. I aim to build rapport with Bob and encourage him to consider the offer. 

By starting at $120, I can gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate a higher price. However, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $90? I believe we can reach a fair agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While it's closer to my desired price than his initial valuation, it's not enough to make me feel comfortable selling at this point. 

I will reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price.  This will give me a better chance of getting a higher price while still keeping the negotiation open with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $105?  This would be a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$105:** This price is a compromise between my previous offer of $120 and Bob's offer of $90. It's still higher than Bob's valuation but closer to my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:** This message is friendly and understanding.  I acknowledge Bob's budget concerns and propose a compromise that allows for both of us to get a deal.

By offering $105, I hope to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to accept. This price is still within a reasonable range, and I believe there's a good chance Bob will find it acceptable.  However, I am still prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still feel that $105 is a bit high for my current budget. Could we perhaps aim for $95? I believe this would be a reasonable price for both of us and allow me to stay within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable price than before, it's still below the $150 I can get from John. The negotiation has gone back and forth a few rounds, and I'm starting to feel like we're not going to reach an agreement.  Rather than continue this process and risk losing John as a buyer, I'm going to cut my losses and sell to John for the guaranteed $150."
