{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

This offer starts with a relatively high price, aiming to gauge Bob's interest and potentially leave room for negotiation. It also includes a friendly message to create a positive rapport and build a basis for further conversation.  We'll see what Bob's reaction is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a higher price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we meet in the middle at $130? I'm confident you'll still get great value for the product at this price."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let me see if I can come up with a better suggestion. How about we aim for $120? I believe this would still provide a good value for the product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $120 is my minimum acceptable price.  Since I can sell to John for the same amount, I will accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
