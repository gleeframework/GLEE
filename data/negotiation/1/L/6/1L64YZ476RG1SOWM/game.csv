"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $1,600,000 is still slightly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This would give you a great deal on a product that's sure to deliver value for your business. Let's reach an agreement that benefits us both.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
