"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. I'm still very interested in purchasing the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my means.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,400,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product and its potential for you.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,700,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $1,550,000? I'm confident that's a fair price for the product, and I'm eager to make a deal.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
