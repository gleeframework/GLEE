Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might be getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating Bob's exact valuation, hinting at the product's ""value"" subtly implies it might be worth more than his perceived $15,000. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Mentioning a public listing subtly reminds Bob that you have other options if he declines, adding a bit of pressure without being too aggressive. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Remember, your absolute floor is $15,000."
