"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is worth $1200000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a significant discount from the product's value to me ($1,200,000).  However, there's room for negotiation. I'm going to try to get an even better price by making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your offer.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, but still a bit high.  I'm going to try to push for a lower price by making another counteroffer."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer is $950,000, which is still a good deal for me. I'm saving $250,000 compared to buying from John. While I'd love to push for a lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting my offer and leaving me with no option but to buy from John at a higher price is too great."
