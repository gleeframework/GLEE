"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. Could you consider coming down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $900,000. Is this a price you'd be comfortable with?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we try to find a middle ground at $800,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I like that you're willing to meet me at $800,000, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I can offer you the product for $950,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great deal for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,5,
