"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $20,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $17,000 for it.  What do you think?",17000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $19,000 for the product. It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great value for both of us.",19000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $19,000 is still a bit outside of my comfort zone. Let's try $18,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",18000.0,Bob,4,
