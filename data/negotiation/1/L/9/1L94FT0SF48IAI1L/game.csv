"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $9,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  $7,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $8,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good deal you won't want to miss.",8500.0,Alice,5,
