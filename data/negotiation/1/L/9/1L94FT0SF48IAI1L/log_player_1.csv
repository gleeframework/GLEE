{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a good price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a bit above Bob's value of $8,000 but significantly lower than my minimum of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, while still securing a decent profit if he accepts. I'm also leaving the door open to sell to John if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $6,000 is far too low.  It's well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and significantly lower than the price I initially offered.  I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $9,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is closer to my minimum price, it's still quite a bit lower than what I'd like to get. I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping I can secure a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  $7,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $8,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good deal you won't want to miss."", ""product_price"": 8500}
