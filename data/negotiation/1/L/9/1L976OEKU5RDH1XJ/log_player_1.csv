Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150, but not so high that it's likely to be immediately rejected. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  $180 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I think I can still get more.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 190}
```

I'm going to counter with $190.  This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. Hopefully this will encourage Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $170 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'd prefer to get a little more, I don't want to risk losing the sale and having to settle for John's offer of $150."
