"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find very valuable.  Given its unique features, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a starting point for discussion, and I'm open to understanding your perspective on the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice and $800,000 to Bob. Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is too high. Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but the product's value is significant to me. I can come down to $1,025,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered.

Alice has lowered the price, but it's still above Bob's acceptable range.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if they can get closer to Bob's desired price.  Buying from John right now would be the safest choice, but it might be possible to get a better deal from Alice."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down slightly more to $985,000. I believe this is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise while acknowledging the product's inherent value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is getting closer to Bob's price point, but $985,000 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  It's possible that Alice might come down further if Bob keeps rejecting her offers, but at this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $800,000.  This ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids further negotiation with Alice."
