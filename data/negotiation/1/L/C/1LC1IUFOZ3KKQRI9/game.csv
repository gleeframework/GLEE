"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for me. Could you do $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $9,000 was a bit steep for you, but I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is my best price, and I think it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you is $10,000.",8500.0,Alice,3,,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $8,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $7,800?",7800.0,Bob,4,,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $7,800, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can do $7,900, but that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm happy to make the deal.",7900.0,Alice,5,,
