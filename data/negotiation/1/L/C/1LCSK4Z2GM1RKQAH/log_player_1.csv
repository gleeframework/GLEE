"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. My asking price is $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $100. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good chance of getting a price closer to what I want. I'm also being friendly and optimistic in my message, hoping to build a rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I'm interested, but I think we can come to an agreement at a lower price. How about $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $80 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get more by continuing to negotiate. I'm going to try to meet him halfway, or at least closer to my original price, in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While I understand you're looking for a lower price, $80 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I'm still hoping for a price closer to my budget. Would $85 be within your considerations? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $85 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80. While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, I don't want to risk losing the sale and having to settle for John's offer.  I'm going to accept this offer and move on."
