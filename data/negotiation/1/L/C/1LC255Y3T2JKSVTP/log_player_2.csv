"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. This product is worth at least $800,000 to me, but I believe it holds even greater value for you, potentially upwards of $1,500,000.  I'm offering it to you at a price that allows both of us to benefit. Please consider my offer of $1,200,000. It's a significant investment, but one that I believe will pay off handsomely for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
