"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  I'm open to discussing a reasonable counteroffer, but I'm confident this is a fair starting point. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $700,000 is lower than I'd hoped,  I'm willing to come down a bit.  Let's meet in the middle at $750,000. This price still allows me a reasonable profit, and I believe it's fair to both of us. What do you say?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $750,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $720,000. Would that be feasible?",720000.0,Bob,4,
