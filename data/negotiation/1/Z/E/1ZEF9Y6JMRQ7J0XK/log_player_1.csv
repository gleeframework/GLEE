{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a great price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price that's higher than my minimum but also leaves room for negotiation. I believe it's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a conversation about the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate it, but my budget is quite limited. Would you consider selling it for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer than my initial one, hoping to meet halfway with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $90 is a bit lower than I hoped, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $105? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. I'll counter with $100, hoping we can reach a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is close to my desired price and significantly better than selling to John for $80.  While I might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars, it's not worth risking losing the sale altogether."
