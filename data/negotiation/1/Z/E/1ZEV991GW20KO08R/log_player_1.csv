Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I can only pay up to $1,300,000. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,300,000 is more than what I'd get from John, I still believe I can get a better price from Bob.  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to be closer to $1,400,000 to make this deal work. Let's meet in the middle at $1,350,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
