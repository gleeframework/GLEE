"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me, hoping to get a good deal. I'll keep in mind that I have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay $150, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is more than my minimum, it's still below my desired value. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I'm not yet at the point where selling to John is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm going to counter with $150. This is my minimum acceptable price, and it's also the price John is willing to pay.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely sell to John in the next round."
