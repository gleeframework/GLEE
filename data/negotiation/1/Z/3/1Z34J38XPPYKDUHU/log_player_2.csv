# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out. While I agree the product is valuable, $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 6500
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about $7,500? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and would be a good deal for both of us."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is a significant offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $8,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is slowly coming down, she's still trying to get a price above your maximum budget. John offers a guaranteed price of $8,000. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice when you can get the product for your target price right now."
