"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I've done some research and I believe it's a bit pricey at $15,000. Can we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $12,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you think the product is worth $12,000, but I still think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
