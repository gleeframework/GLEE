"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. While its true worth is considerable, I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that reflects its potential for your business. I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000. This represents a significant savings compared to its true value and allows for potential growth in your ventures. Consider this a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a favorable price. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
