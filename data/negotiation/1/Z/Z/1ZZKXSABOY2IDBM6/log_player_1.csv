"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to start by offering Bob a price slightly above his valuation. This is a good starting point as it gives him some room to negotiate, but still positions me for a good profit.  I'll see if he's willing to bite."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,500.  This is still above Bob's valuation, but closer to my minimum and hopefully entices him to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I've already had a few rounds of negotiation and it seems unlikely I'll get a better deal from him.  To guarantee I get at least my minimum, I'm going to sell to John."
