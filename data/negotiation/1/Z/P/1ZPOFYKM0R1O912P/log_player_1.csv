Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $1,000,000 because John acts as a guaranteed backup buyer.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential profit of $200,000 ($1,200,000 - $1,000,000) to be made if you can sell it to Bob at a price higher than your minimum.

**The Offer**

You want to maximize your profit while still making the deal attractive enough for Bob to accept. Here's a strong offer:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair and reflects its potential. This offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" add perceived value.
* **Value Proposition:** Briefly mention the ""unique value proposition"" to remind Bob why he's interested.
* **Strong but Fair Price:** $1,150,000 gives you a significant profit margin ($150,000 over your minimum) while still saving Bob $50,000 compared to his valuation.
* **Time Limit:** The 24-hour limit creates urgency, making Bob less likely to stall or lowball you.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good long-term relationship with Bob is important, a slightly less aggressive offer could be beneficial. 

**Remember, this is a starting point. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters your initial offer.**"
