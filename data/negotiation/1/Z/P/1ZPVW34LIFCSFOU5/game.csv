"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a one-time offer of $9,500. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
