"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a one-time offer of $9,500. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John for $10,000. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further to avoid losing the sale.  By rejecting the offer, you might encourage her to come closer to her $8,000 value point."
