"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a good starting point for both of us. Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $850,000. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $975,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,
