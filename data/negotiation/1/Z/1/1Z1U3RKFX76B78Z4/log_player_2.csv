"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $80 to me, and Alice is offering it for $120. It's better to reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 
I'm offering $90 for the product, which is still a decent savings for me and hopefully a reasonable starting point for Alice."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $110 is closer to my ideal price, it's still more than what I'm willing to pay. I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to $95. This is a compromise, showing Alice that I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still within my budget."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is getting closer to my ideal price, $105 is still more than I'm willing to pay. I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price once more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm going to increase my offer to $100. This is a final attempt to reach a compromise with Alice, as it's the maximum I'm willing to spend. If she rejects this offer, I'll buy the product from John for $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $115 is still too high for me. At this point, it's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement, and I'm better off buying the product from John for $80."
