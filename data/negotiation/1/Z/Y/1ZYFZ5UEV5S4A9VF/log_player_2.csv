"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its value and the benefits it provides, I propose a price of $140 for this product. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $140 is less than Alice's valuation of $150, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $120. It's better to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  However, $140 is a bit above what I'm able to spend right now. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a compromise."", ""product_price"": 125}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I am willing to consider your offer, but I need to ensure that I am also compensated fairly for the product. Therefore, I propose a price of $135 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your budget while still providing me with a reasonable return. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $135 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum limit. Bob is trying to save as much money as possible, so it's worth seeing if Alice will come down further with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $135 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to go up to $130.  This is a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. "", ""product_price"": 130}
