"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  However, $140 is a bit above what I'm able to spend right now. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",125.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I am willing to consider your offer, but I need to ensure that I am also compensated fairly for the product. Therefore, I propose a price of $135 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your budget while still providing me with a reasonable return.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $135 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to go up to $130.  This is a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. ",130.0,Bob,4,
