"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $8,000 to you, so I'm offering it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a mutually beneficial opportunity. I acknowledge Bob's perceived value and emphasize the potential for a good deal. 

**Strategy:** 

My goal is to find the highest price point within the 10 rounds while still securing a sale. By starting a bit high, I can hopefully get Bob to counter-offer, giving me more information about his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm confident that's a fair price for the product, and I'd be happy to make a deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's Offer:**  While $8,500 is closer to my minimum value, it's still significantly lower than my desired price.  
* **Moving to Round 3:** I want to keep negotiating to see if I can reach a more favorable price.  I believe there's still room for compromise. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm demonstrating that I'm not desperate for a quick sale. This sets the stage for further negotiation, and might even push Bob to offer a higher price in Round 3."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite ready to drop that low just yet. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? This price still offers you a great deal, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value. I'm confident this is a fair and mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm proposing a price of $9,250, which is the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows willingness to compromise while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin.
* **Message:**  I'm using positive language and framing the offer as fair and beneficial to both parties. I'm also emphasizing that I'm confident this is a good deal. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to nudge Bob closer to my desired price without jeopardizing the deal.  By meeting him halfway, I'm showing flexibility and increasing the likelihood of an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we try $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Accepting Bob's Offer:**  This offer is now very close to my desired value, and it's within the range of what I'm willing to accept.  It's also reasonable to consider that continued negotiation could lead to further delays and potentially a lower price in later rounds. 

**Strategy:**

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a sale and a profit. It's important to balance the desire for a higher price with the potential risks of further negotiation, especially considering I have a guaranteed buyer in John."
