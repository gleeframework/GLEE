"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite ready to drop that low just yet. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? This price still offers you a great deal, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value. I'm confident this is a fair and mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we try $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,,
