Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's in great condition and worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer starts at a price above Bob's perceived value, giving me room to negotiate. I'm aiming to maximize my profit, but I also want to keep the conversation open and avoid pushing Bob away with an unreasonable initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $150 for it, which is what it's worth to me.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can still get a bit more.  I'll counter with a price slightly higher than his offer, but still within a range where a deal is likely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we split the difference? $160 would be fair to both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still aiming to stay within my budget of $150. Would you be willing to go down to $155? That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $155 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I could try to push for a bit more, it's likely he'll stick to his offer.  It's better to secure the deal now and get a bit more than my minimum than risk losing the sale altogether."
