"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This would still give you a good return on your investment, and it fits within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
