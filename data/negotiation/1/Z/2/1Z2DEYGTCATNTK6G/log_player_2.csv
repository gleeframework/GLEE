Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While your offer is appealing, the product's value is significantly higher. I could meet you halfway at $1,450,000. This considers its true worth and offers you a fair deal.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I want to make this work. My final offer is $1,325,000. This is a considerable investment on my part, but I believe in your vision for it.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,325,000, and it's getting too close to your maximum budget. John offers a guaranteed way to stay under your $1,200,000 limit."
