"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $9,500.  I believe this price reflects the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Alice's offer is less than your maximum budget, you can likely get a better price. John offers the product for $10,000, but there's a chance to negotiate a lower price with Alice or find another seller altogether."
