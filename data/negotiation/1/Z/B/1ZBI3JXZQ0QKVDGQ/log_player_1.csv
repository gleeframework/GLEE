"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. This allows for a potential compromise.
* **Positive Framing:** My message is positive and focuses on the value of the product for Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm not closing the door on further discussion by leaving the message open-ended."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, there's still potential for a deal. I can counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed outcome. However, it's worth exploring if I can get closer to that amount through negotiation with Bob.  I still have 8 rounds to explore this option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, showing flexibility while still staying above Bob's initial offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the true value of the product to reinforce the price point.
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a positive and collaborative tone to keep the negotiation open."
