"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than John's price. It's worth negotiating to see if we can get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This approach:

* **Signals our budget limitations:**  It clearly communicates that $12,000 is beyond our desired spending limit.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  There's space for Alice to counter, and for us to potentially meet somewhere in the middle.
* **Keeps John's offer in mind:**  Our target price remains close to John's offer, giving us a backup option if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has met our target price of $10,000, which is the same price John is offering. There's no point in further negotiation or risking losing the deal to get the product at the same price from John."
