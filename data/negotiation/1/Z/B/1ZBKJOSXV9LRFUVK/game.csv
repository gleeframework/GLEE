"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate it, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. How about we meet in the middle at $100?",100.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $115?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a little too high for me. I'm happy to go up to $110.  What do you think?",110.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate that! I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about we meet at $118?",118.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you working with me. I'm still a bit hesitant at $118.  Would you consider $115? That would be a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,6,

"I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $117, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What do you think?",117.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm still a bit hesitant at $117. How about we split the difference and settle at $116?  It's a good deal for both of us.",116.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I'm willing to go as low as $116, Bob. I think I can do $119, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll really love the product.",119.0,Alice,9,
