"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider products within the $8,000 range. I understand the value of this product, but I believe we can find common ground. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,000 is too low.  Would you consider $12,500? It's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I still feel that $12,500 is out of my price range. I'd like to propose $11,000 as a compromise. This is a fair price that respects both our positions.",11000.0,Bob,4,
