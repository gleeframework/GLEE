Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a higher initial price:** Starting at $10,000 allows room for negotiation while aiming for a price above your minimum.
* **Highlighting value:**  The message subtly emphasizes the product's worth, potentially influencing Bob's perception.
* **Backup plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 with John, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes some flexibility in Bob's budget and a potential willingness to pay a premium. 
* Observe Bob's reaction to the initial offer and be prepared to negotiate if necessary."
