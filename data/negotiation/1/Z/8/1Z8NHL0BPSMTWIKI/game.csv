"I'm really interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to work with you, but $8000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal work. How about we meet in the middle at $13000? This gives you a good price, and still allows me to make a reasonable profit.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $13000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to go up to $9500, but that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Bob,4,
