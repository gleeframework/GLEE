"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob is truly interested.  I want to see how he reacts to this initial offer and gauge his interest level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $15,000 is a good amount, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price of $18,000.  I'm confident that I can get a better deal with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with $16,500. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and his offer, showing a willingness to meet him halfway. I believe this price is still fair, given the value of the product to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While $14,500 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can get a bit more. I believe Bob is still interested in the product, and I'm confident I can push for a higher price. I'm not yet willing to sell to John for $12,000 because I think there's still room for negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with $15,500.  This is a slight increase from his last offer, but it's still a significant drop from my initial asking price.  I'm trying to find a middle ground where we can both be happy.  At this point, I'm running out of rounds, so I need to be more flexible.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to convince Bob to make a final deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $14,000. While it's not ideal, it's better than selling to John for $12,000. I'm running out of rounds and need to make a decision. I'm confident that I can still make a profit, and it's better to secure a deal now than risk losing the sale entirely."
