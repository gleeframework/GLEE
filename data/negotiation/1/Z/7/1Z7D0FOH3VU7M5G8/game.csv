"I'd like to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000, and I'm willing to make a deal with you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you'll receive from the sale.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is closer to your offer and allows me to make the purchase.  Let's find a middle ground,  what do you say?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'll meet you at $1,080,000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
