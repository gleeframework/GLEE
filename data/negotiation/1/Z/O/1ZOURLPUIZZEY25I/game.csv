"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you consider that?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your offer, I need to make a bit more to make this worthwhile.  How about $9,000?  That's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? That's the best I can do.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $8,750 is just a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $8,875?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and would get this deal done.",8875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I can do $8,500, but that's as low as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",8500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a limited budget, but $8,500 is just not enough for me.  Let's compromise again. How about $8,625? This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",8625.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still a bit short. I can do $8,550, but that's the absolute maximum I can afford. Can you reconsider?",8550.0,Bob,8,
