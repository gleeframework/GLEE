"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16000. This price still gives you a great value and leaves room for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $16000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring me. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14000 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $15000? That's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,5,
