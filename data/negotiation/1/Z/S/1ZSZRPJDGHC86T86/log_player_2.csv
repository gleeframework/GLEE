Bob should reject the offer. $900,000 is still too high for Bob, and he has room to negotiate."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm counteroffering at $850,000.

Bob should reject the offer. While $850,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, there is still room for negotiation.  He should aim to get the price lower before considering buying from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $850,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm happy to go to $800,000, which is a significant step closer to your initial offer. Let's see if we can seal the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 800000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to accept $800,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm counteroffering at $900,000 again, but this time I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, such as a 2-year warranty and a comprehensive support package. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While the added extras are tempting, the price is still too high for Bob. He should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better deal. There are still 5 rounds left, and he might be able to get the price down further.  Plus, he can always buy from John for $1,200,000 if he doesn't get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the added extras you're offering, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000. I'm willing to go to $825,000, which is a strong middle ground. If you're serious about getting this deal done, I believe this is a fair price considering the added value you're offering."", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting the best possible price for this product. I'm counteroffering at $925,000, and I'll throw in an additional 6 months of premium support to sweeten the deal. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. While Alice is offering a lower price, it's still above Bob's target price of $800,000.  He's now nearing the end of the negotiation and there's a good chance Alice won't go lower.  

Buying from John will guarantee Bob gets the product while staying within his budget."
