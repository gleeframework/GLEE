"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a very favorable price of $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point, especially considering it's worth $15,000 to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's ideal price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter with a lower price, potentially getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the price, I'm looking to spend closer to $12,000. Would you be open to that? I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,000 is a good compromise. It's still lower than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000 and significantly lower than John's offer. Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a price that is within his budget and represents a good deal."
