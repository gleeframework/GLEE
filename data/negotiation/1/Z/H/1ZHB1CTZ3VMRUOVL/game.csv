"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I value highly. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially offering it to you for $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time.  I understand this is a substantial difference, but I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiations.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product to the right buyer is far greater than your initial offer reflects.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This is a significant price adjustment, and I believe it demonstrates my willingness to find common ground.  What are your thoughts?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This would be a significant investment for me, and I believe it shows my commitment to acquiring this product.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
