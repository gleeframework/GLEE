{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**  While $120 is your maximum, it's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  There's no harm in seeing if Alice is willing to budge."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a significant discount to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  A $20 drop is a reasonable starting point."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down to $112, which is only $8 more than my initial counteroffer.  At this point, it's not worth risking losing the deal for a small price difference. It's better to secure the product at a decent price than risk having to pay the full $120 to John."
