"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for a price of $1,300,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to $1,000,000 would be a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I have 8 rounds left, and I want to explore if I can get closer to my desired price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter-offer and hopefully get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $1,000,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but  $1,150,000 is the lowest I can go at this point.  Let's keep working towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, $1,075,000 is still below my target. I have 6 rounds left, and I'm hoping to get a higher offer from Bob or potentially even John.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,075,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,125,000?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm still holding out for a higher offer. While $1,100,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I have 4 rounds left and John is still a viable option. I'll counteroffer and try to push for a better deal."
