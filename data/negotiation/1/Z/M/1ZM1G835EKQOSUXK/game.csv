"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is excellent, that price is a little high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and its worth to me.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I could go up to $700,000.  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe the product is worth it.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $700,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to reach my minimum of $1,000,000. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",850000.0,Alice,5,
