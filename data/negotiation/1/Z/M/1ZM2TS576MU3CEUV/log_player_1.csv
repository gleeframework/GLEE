Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120.  I believe it's a great deal and will be valuable to you."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This provides room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you insight into his level of interest and price sensitivity.
* **Fallback Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $80 to John, so there's limited risk in aiming high with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters or expresses hesitation."
