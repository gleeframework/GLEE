Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price of $1,350,000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can get closer to $1,400,000 with more negotiation.  I have 9 rounds left and still have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000 as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,375,000.  This reflects the value of the product while also acknowledging your position. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $1,360,000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,360,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  We've only had 4 rounds, and I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000 if necessary.  I'll aim for a counteroffer that gets us closer to $1,375,000 in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. Let's bridge the gap. I'm willing to go down to $1,365,000. This shows my commitment to a deal, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1365000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my previous offers. I've reviewed the situation further and am now proposing a price of $1,355,000 for the product. I hope this proposal helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,355,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,355,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, we're getting close to the end of the negotiation. Bob's offer is only $5,000 less than my previous counteroffer, and we have only 4 rounds remaining. Accepting his offer ensures I get a good price and avoids the risk of a deal falling through entirely.  I can always use the $1,355,000 to invest in something else or potentially even find another buyer who might be willing to pay more."
