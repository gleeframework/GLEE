"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to meet in the middle, but I'm not sure I can quite get to $850000. How about we meet at $900000? It's a bit of a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for this exceptional product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher than $900000. How about we meet at $880000? I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",880000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're willing to pay a premium, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $880000. How about we meet at $920000? It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but I think it's a fair price for this exceptional product.",920000.0,Alice,5,
