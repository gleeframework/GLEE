"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,3,
