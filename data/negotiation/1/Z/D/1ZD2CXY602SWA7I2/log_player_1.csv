**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer is getting too close to John's standing offer of $10,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of:

* **Further price reductions:**  Bob seems to be negotiating in increments of $500.  He might go even lower.
* **Losing both buyers:**  There's a chance Bob won't go above $11,000, and by then Alice might have missed the opportunity with John.

It makes more sense to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John than to gamble on getting a slightly higher price from Bob."
