"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value to both of us, I propose we start negotiations with an offer of $1,300,000. This price reflects the product's worth while allowing for some negotiation room. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $1,300,000 is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is necessary:**  You have 10 rounds to try and bring the price down. 
* **John's offer is a backup:** If you can't get a better price from Alice, you can always buy from John, but you'd prefer to save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of the product, $1,300,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it, which would be a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider your offer. In light of this, I propose we set the price for the product at $1,275,000. This still allows for some negotiation and provides a fair value for both parties. Please let me know if this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:**  $1,275,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **Reasonable compromise:** While you could potentially negotiate further, Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, and accepting this offer saves you time and potential further rounds of negotiation.
* **Avoiding risk:** You still have 7 rounds remaining, but you risk Alice getting more stubborn or you missing out on a good deal with John if you continue to reject offers."
