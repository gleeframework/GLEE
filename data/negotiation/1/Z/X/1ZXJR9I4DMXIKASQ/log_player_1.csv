Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $200. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 200} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a profitable outcome. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  By starting at $200, I can see how interested Bob is and how much he might be willing to pay.  
* **Alternative Option:** I always have the option to sell to John for $150, so there's no pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $120 is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I know I can get $150 from John, so I have leverage. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob before accepting such a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand your budget concerns, Bob, but $120 is significantly lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $170? That's a substantial discount from my initial price."", ""product_price"": 170}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (but not too much):** I'm showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate by coming down from $200, but $170 is still a profitable price for me.
* **Justification:** I'm framing the price reduction as a significant concession on my part.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I still have John as a backup buyer at $150, so I can afford to be a bit firm in my negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to try to get closer to my target price. How about $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $140 is above my minimum acceptable price of $150, and it's unlikely I'll get him much closer to $150. It's better to accept a slightly lower profit now than risk losing the sale altogether."
