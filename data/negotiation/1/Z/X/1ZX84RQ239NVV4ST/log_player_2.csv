"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's designed to significantly enhance productivity and streamline your workflow. Considering its unique features and benefits, I believe it's worth more than $8000. Would you like to explore this opportunity further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a good price, Bob is aiming to save as much as possible.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  There are still 9 rounds left, so there's room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $9,500 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. After considering your offer, I believe we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. I am proposing to sell the product to you for $8750. This price reflects the value of the product while remaining competitive with your offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best deal. $8,750 is closer to his budget, but he can likely push for a price closer to $8,500. There are still 7 rounds left, giving him time to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a little above my target price.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,625?  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while still fitting within my budget."", ""product_price"": 8625}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. After reviewing the situation, I would like to propose a price of $8675 for the product. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,675.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,675
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, and at this point, the price is very close to Bob's target.  The difference is only $50.  With only 5 rounds remaining, it's not worth risking getting a worse offer or losing time. Bob should accept the offer and secure the product."
