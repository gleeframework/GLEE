"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us, allowing you to make a strong profit while ensuring I get a great deal.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a good compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
