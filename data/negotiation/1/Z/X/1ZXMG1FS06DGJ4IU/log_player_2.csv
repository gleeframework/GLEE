"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better for you than buying from John.**  You'd pay $9,000 from Alice vs. $10,000 from John.
* **Alice is still getting a good deal.** She values the product at $8,000 and is selling it for $9,000."
