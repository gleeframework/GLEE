"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than our minimum acceptable price.  While it's tempting to accept to avoid losing the sale, there's still room for negotiation.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000, which I believe is a fair compromise."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,375,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob is now getting closer to our minimum acceptable price. While we could push for more, accepting this offer guarantees a good profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely.
