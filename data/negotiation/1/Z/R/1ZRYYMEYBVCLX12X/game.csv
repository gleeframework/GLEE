"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, even more so than my initial asking price.  To make this a smooth transaction, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $10,000 is significantly below what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $11,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",11500.0,Bob,4,
