# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 
You want to save as much money as possible, and $120 is still a bit higher than you'd like to pay.  Rejecting the offer gives you the chance to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to pay closer to $100, but I was thinking more along the lines of $115. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $115 is better than $120, it's still higher than you'd like to pay. You're hoping to get it closer to $100, and another round of negotiation may get you there."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're interested in the product, Bob! I can see you're a serious buyer. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a decent profit. How about we meet at $125? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $125 is getting closer to your desired price, but it's still too high. It's worth noting that Alice is starting to become more firm in her pricing.  There's a chance you could negotiate further, but you risk Alice getting frustrated and walking away from the deal.  Since you're comfortable paying $150 to John, it's probably better to just buy from him and avoid further negotiation."
