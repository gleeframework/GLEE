"Alice, your offer is too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only afford $1,100,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. While your offer is reasonable, the product's unique value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,400,000? This would be a significant discount from your original offer and still allow you to make a good profit.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,650,000? This reflects the value while acknowledging your position.",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm happy we're getting closer. However, $1,650,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
