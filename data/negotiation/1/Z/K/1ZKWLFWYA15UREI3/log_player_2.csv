"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, as I know it would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than John's price of $15,000, it's still significantly higher than Alice's own valuation of $8,000. This suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob might be able to get Alice to lower her price further."
