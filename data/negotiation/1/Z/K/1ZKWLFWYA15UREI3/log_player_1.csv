Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, as I know it would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $12,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, starting with a price of $12,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significantly higher profit than selling to John.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies that Alice is aware of the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price without explicitly revealing that she knows his valuation. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The phrase ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation open.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still giving Bob a reason to accept a price significantly higher than Alice's minimum."
