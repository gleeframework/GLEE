Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $11500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $10500? That's a fair price considering I could get the product from someone else for $10000.
