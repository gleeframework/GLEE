While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my ideal price point. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $13,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it still leaves me a comfortable profit.  Let me know if you're interested!

Alice has come down to $13,500, which is within my budget and a good price considering John is asking $15,000.  It's worth accepting this offer and finalizing the deal."
