"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to make you a serious offer: I'll sell the product to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay up to $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 was a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and its worth to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,050,000 is a good offer, I'm still a bit over my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000 for the product. This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can make this work.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $950,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000 again, but I'll throw in a sweetener - I'll also include a 2-year warranty on the product. This is a rare opportunity to get a top-notch product with excellent support. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
