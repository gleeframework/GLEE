"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is looking to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is a better price than John's $12,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing negotiations with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm prepared to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $11,000. This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now at $11,000**, which is better than John's price of $12,000.
* **Bob's goal is to save money**, and accepting Alice's offer achieves that goal.  
* While Bob might be able to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject any further counteroffers, forcing him to buy from John at a higher price.  

Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price and avoids unnecessary risk."
