"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  I think it's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's find a compromise!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which would be $9,750. Can you consider that?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $9,750 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,000 as a final compromise. It's a good price for both of us and allows us to close this deal. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,
