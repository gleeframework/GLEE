"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value, knowing that Bob is likely to counteroffer. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The offer allows for negotiation and potential compromise while still maintaining a significant profit margin.
* **Positive and polite:** The message is friendly and open to discussion, setting a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,200,000 is far too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good price for you considering its value to you. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable value.**  While $850,000 is a good deal for him, it's not for me.  
* **There's still room for negotiation:** I have multiple rounds left and can potentially increase the price through counteroffers.
* **Selling to John is a safe bet:** However, I'm not desperate to sell to Bob.  Having John as a backup option gives me more leverage.  

I'll counteroffer Bob with a slightly lower price, aiming to bridge the gap without settling too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not ready to accept that price yet.  It's below my minimum acceptable value. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'll counter with $1,000,000. This still offers you a good deal, considering the product's value to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but not too much:**  I'm reducing my price slightly, showing flexibility, but still ensuring a profit that's close to my minimum acceptable value.
* **Highlighting the value to Bob:**  Reminding Bob of the product's worth to him helps justify the price and encourages him to consider the deal.
* **Positive tone:**  Maintaining a respectful and friendly tone keeps the negotiation open and encourages a resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still above my maximum. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000, but it's still not there.
* **Time is on my side:** I have 6 more rounds and John as a backup, so I'm not under pressure to accept this offer.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can still push for a higher price, especially since Bob is willing to negotiate.

I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my minimum but higher than Bob's offer, aiming to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $900,000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $1,000,000. Let's split the difference - I'll accept $950,000.  It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the difference:** This approach shows a willingness to compromise and signals that I'm serious about reaching a deal.
* **Focus on speed:** Emphasizing a quick closure can motivate Bob to accept, especially if he values the product.
* **Still profitable:** $950,000 is above my minimum acceptable value, ensuring I still make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire to get closer to $1,000,000, but I'm still firm on my maximum budget of $900,000. It's a fair price, and I believe we can both walk away satisfied. Let's close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited negotiation space:** Bob is sticking to his maximum of $900,000, and we're running out of rounds. 
* **John's offer is secure:**  John's offer of $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable value and a sure deal.
* **Risk of losing value:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks getting stuck with a lower price or reaching a stalemate.

It's better to be safe and secure the $1,000,000 deal with John, guaranteeing the maximum profit."
