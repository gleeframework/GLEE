"Alice, $1,200,000 is far too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good price for you considering its value to you. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not ready to accept that price yet.  It's below my minimum acceptable value. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'll counter with $1,000,000. This still offers you a good deal, considering the product's value to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still above my maximum. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $900,000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $1,000,000. Let's split the difference - I'll accept $950,000.  It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal quickly.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your desire to get closer to $1,000,000, but I'm still firm on my maximum budget of $900,000. It's a fair price, and I believe we can both walk away satisfied. Let's close the deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,
