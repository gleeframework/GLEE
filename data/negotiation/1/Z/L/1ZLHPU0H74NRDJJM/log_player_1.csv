Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I would like to propose a price of $1050000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,000,000.  I believe I can negotiate a higher price.  It's important to note that Bob's counteroffer shows his interest, and I have 8 rounds remaining to explore a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,050,000 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I accept $1,100,000? This is still a great price for you, considering the value it holds for your business."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. Let's try $1075000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'm confident that I can secure a higher price.  There are still 6 rounds remaining, giving me ample opportunity to get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down a little further, to $1,090,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and your business needs. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 1090000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. Considering the value of the product, I'd like to propose a price of $1080000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,080,000 is very close to my desired price point and above the $1,000,000 I could get from John.  With only 4 rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating, especially since Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum.  Accepting this offer is a smart decision that secures a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
