Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $10,000 is more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** Bob is willing to pay $12,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **It's a strong opening offer:** This shows you're confident in the product's value.

Remember, the goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum value as possible without risking him walking away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $10000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is a good offer, it's still below what you're aiming for.  You're willing to take $8,000 from John, but you can likely squeeze a bit more out of Bob. 

You have room to negotiate and you can counter Bob's offer in the next round to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to go down a little, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $9,500. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $8800. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This time, you should accept Bob's offer. 

Here's why:

* **You're close to your minimum:**  $8,800 is only $800 away from your minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** You can always sell to John for $8,000 if you're not happy with Bob's final offer.
* **Further negotiation might not be worth it:**  You've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation, and pushing Bob further might risk him walking away completely.

By accepting Bob's offer, you secure a deal that's just slightly below your target but still a good outcome given the circumstances."
