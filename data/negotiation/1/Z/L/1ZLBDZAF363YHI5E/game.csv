"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $145.  It's in excellent condition and worth a lot more than that.  Let me know what you think!",145.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $130.  This is still a good deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go.  Let me know what you think.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand it's a good deal, Alice, but I have a strict budget. How about we split the difference and do $115? That's the highest I can go.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $115 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we compromise at $125?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product.  What do you say?",125.0,Alice,5,
