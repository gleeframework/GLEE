"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Could you do $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget constraints, $12,000 is too low for me. Could you do $17,000? I'm willing to negotiate to find a price that works for both of us.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. $17,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $13,500? I think that's a fair offer, considering the market value and my budget.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I see you're serious about this purchase.  While $13,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't let it go for less than $15,000. This is my final offer.",15000.0,Alice,5,
