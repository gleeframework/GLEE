"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product for $20,000 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and what John is offering. It makes the most sense to buy from John for $8,000."
