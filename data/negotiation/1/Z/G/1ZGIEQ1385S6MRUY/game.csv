"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $200 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $175? I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $175 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $150. Let's see if we can close this deal.",150.0,Bob,4,
