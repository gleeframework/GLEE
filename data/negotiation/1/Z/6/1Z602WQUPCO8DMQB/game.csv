"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $11,500 is a bit high for me. Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $10,500. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm confident this product offers you significant value beyond $10,500. How about meeting halfway at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,750. It's a fair price for both of us, and it would save me a considerable amount.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,750 is tempting, I'm still confident this product is worth more to you in the long run.  Let's try $10,900 â€“ it's a strong offer reflecting the product's true value.",10900.0,Alice,5,
