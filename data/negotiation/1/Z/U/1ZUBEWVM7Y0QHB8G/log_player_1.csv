{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This initial offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation while still being significantly profitable for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $9500 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still below your desired profit margin. Rejecting his offer allows you to counter and potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,250.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with $10000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is exactly your minimum acceptable price. You can either accept and sell the product to Bob or sell it to John for the same price.  Since you're aiming for the highest possible profit,  accepting Bob's offer makes sense. It allows you to close the deal without any further negotiation and move on to other opportunities."
