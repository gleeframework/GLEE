"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think you'd find it valuable.  I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me in the middle?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is too low for me. How about we settle at $100?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit above my budget with $100. Would you be willing to go down to $85? I really think this product would be a great fit for me.,85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $85 is really pushing my lower limit.  I can do $95 as my final offer.  It's a great deal for this product.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $92.50? I think that's a fair price for this product.",92.5,Bob,6,
