I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $120 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get closer to my desired price of $140."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $130. This product is in excellent condition, and I know it's worth a lot to you. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. Considering the value of the product to me, I think $125 would be a reasonable price to pay.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer of $125 is pretty close to my desired price of $130, and it's definitely better than selling to John for $100. I'm going to accept his offer and close the deal."
