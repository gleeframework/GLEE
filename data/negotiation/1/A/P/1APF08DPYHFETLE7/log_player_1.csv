"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate, while still leaving a significant profit margin.  I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy accordingly."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm happy to sell to John for $120, I want to see if I can get a better deal from Bob. I'm going to reject his initial offer and try to counteroffer for a price closer to my original asking price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}

I'm going to counter with $135. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing a willingness to compromise, but still leaves me with a decent profit margin. I'll see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is getting close to my minimum, I'm still not willing to accept it.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get Bob closer to $120. If that fails, I'll go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
