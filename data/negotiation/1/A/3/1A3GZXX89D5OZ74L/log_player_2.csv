"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value, and while my asking price is $20,000, I'm open to discussing a figure that works for both of us. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I'm not interested in paying $20,000 for the product. That's way above my budget of $15,000. I'll reject Alice's offer and see if I can find a better deal elsewhere.
