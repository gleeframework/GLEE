"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth at least $150 to me. It gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $180 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 190}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $190. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a profit closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $175. While it's not my ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise, and we're getting closer to a deal.  I'm concerned about running out of rounds and ending up with only the $150 from John."
