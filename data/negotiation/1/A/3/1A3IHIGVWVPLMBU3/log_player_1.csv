Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so anything above that is pure profit.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Space:**  There's a potential negotiation space between $800,000 and $1,200,000.

**Strategy**

You want to offer a price that's attractive enough for Bob to accept, while still maximizing your profit.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you can afford to start higher than Bob's perceived value.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,000,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire an asset that will greatly benefit you."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** $1,000,000 is a strong starting point. It leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above Bob's valuation.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message highlights the ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high price and appeal to Bob's potential gain.
* **Clear and Concise:** The offer is straightforward, making it easy for Bob to understand and respond.

**Important Notes:**

* **Bob's Response:**  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer or try to negotiate. You have the leverage of another buyer, but be willing to adjust within the negotiation space if needed.
* **Relationship:**  Consider your long-term relationship with Bob. If it's important, you might be willing to accept a slightly lower price for a quicker and more amicable deal."
