"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its worth to you and still well above my minimum asking price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  How about we split the difference and go with $850,000? This would still be a great deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.
