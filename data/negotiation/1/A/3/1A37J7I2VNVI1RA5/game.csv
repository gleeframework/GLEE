"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its worth to you and still well above my minimum asking price. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  How about we split the difference and go with $850,000? This would still be a great deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you have a bottom line to consider. How about we settle at $775,000? It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a solution.  However, $775,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's aim for a deal that benefits both of us. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a fair compromise, as it's well above my minimum and still gives you a great value.  I hope we can reach an agreement this round.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close! I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $800,000. This reflects a serious offer on my part and acknowledges the value of your product. Let me know if this works for you.",800000.0,Bob,6,
