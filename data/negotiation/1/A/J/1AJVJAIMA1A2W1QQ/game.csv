"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget of $100, and I appreciate your interest in the product.  To make this work for both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $115? This would still give you a great deal, and it's closer to the value I'm hoping for.  Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,3,
