"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 reasoning: While $9,000 is less than my maximum budget, it's significantly higher than Alice's valuation. I should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $9,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I've chosen to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still comfortably above her perceived value of the product. This tactic aims to:

* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:** A large counteroffer helps understand if Alice is open to significant negotiation or sticking closer to her initial price.
* **Establish a strong negotiating position:** Starting low leaves room for me to gradually increase my offer while staying well below my maximum budget.

This strategy balances aggressiveness with politeness, aiming for a mutually beneficial deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to her valuation of the product.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she'll walk away. Accepting this offer secures a good price for me and avoids the risk of having to pay John's higher price."
