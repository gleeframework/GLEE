Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1400000} 

I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a profit that exceeds my minimum threshold of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,300,000 is more than my minimum, I'm not satisfied with that price given that the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a compromise that's still higher than Bob's offer but shows I'm willing to negotiate. It also leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
