Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $110 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140. This still leaves you a significant profit margin, and it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's make this happen!

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair here. $120 just doesn't work for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $130? This is my final offer, and it's a great deal for you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

Alice is holding firm and unlikely to go below $130. It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed deal from John at $100."
