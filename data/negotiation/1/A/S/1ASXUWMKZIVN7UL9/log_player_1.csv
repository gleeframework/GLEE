Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $1,200,000 (our guaranteed sale price to John) as possible. 
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob, who might be willing to pay a bit more than his perceived value.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly and not risk losing the opportunity.

**Important:** This offer balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. If we ask for too much more, Bob will likely walk away."
