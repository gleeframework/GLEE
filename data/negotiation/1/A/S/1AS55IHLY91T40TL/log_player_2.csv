"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1.5 million to you, and I'm offering it to you for a price that's significantly less than that.  I'm confident that this is an offer you won't want to miss. Let's discuss a price that's mutually beneficial.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is clearly trying to negotiate up from a weak position.** She claims the product is worth at least $1.5 million to you, but you know your own valuation is lower.  Her opening offer of $1,200,000 is still significantly above your $1,500,000 fallback option.

* **There's room for negotiation.**  By rejecting this initial offer, you signal that you're serious about getting a better price. Alice is more likely to come down closer to her $800,000 valuation if she thinks she might lose the sale. 

* **You have a safety net.** You can always go with John for $1,500,000 if Alice refuses to negotiate reasonably."
