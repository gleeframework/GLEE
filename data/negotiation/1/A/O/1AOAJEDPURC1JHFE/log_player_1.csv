{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $17,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above the minimum I'm willing to accept ($15,000). This gives me some room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and positive to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting that the product is something Bob would be interested in, which might make him more willing to consider a higher price. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll wait for Bob's response. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll need to consider his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, reject it, or make a new counteroffer.
* **John as Backup:**  I'm keeping John in mind as a backup option. If the negotiations with Bob break down, I can always sell to John for my minimum price of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $17,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Below My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $14,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **John as a Backup:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $15,000, which is more than what Bob is offering. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer to Bob:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum. I'll need to be strategic about the counteroffer amount to try to close the gap with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000. That's a fair price considering the value of this product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price halfway between my initial offer of $17,000 and Bob's counteroffer of $14,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and meet him halfway.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and encouraging to maintain a good relationship.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll wait for Bob's response to my counteroffer. 
* **Possible Outcomes:**
    * If Bob accepts:  Great!  Deal closed.
    * If Bob rejects: I'll need to decide if I want to make another counteroffer, or sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $15,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $15,500 is just $500 below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Better Than John's Offer:** While John offers a guaranteed $15,000, there's a chance I might be able to get a slightly better deal with Bob, even if it's just $500.
* **Negotiations are Going Well:** We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and we're getting closer to an agreement.  It's likely that I can get even closer to my asking price with continued negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept Bob's Offer:**  I will accept Bob's offer and close the deal. 
* **Future Negotiations:**  Even though I accepted Bob's offer, I'll keep in mind that I could have potentially pushed for a higher price if I had continued negotiating."
