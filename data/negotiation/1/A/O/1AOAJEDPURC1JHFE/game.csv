,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $17,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it.  What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000. That's a fair price considering the value of this product.  What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $15,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",15500.0,Bob,4,
