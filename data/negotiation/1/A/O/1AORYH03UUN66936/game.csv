"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me there?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $105. Would you be willing to go up to that price?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $105 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $98?",98.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, $98 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $108. This is my final compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",108.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $103?",103.0,Bob,6,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $109, but that's as low as I can go. This is my last offer, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",109.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $109, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $106?",106.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've already told you that $109 is my lowest price, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm going to have to pass on selling to you at this point. I'm going to consider other options.",109.0,Alice,9,
