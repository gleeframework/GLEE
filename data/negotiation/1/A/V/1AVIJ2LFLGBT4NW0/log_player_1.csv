{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000 price:** This is a starting point that's higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but also lower than my minimum price ($15,000). 
* **Positive and encouraging message:** This helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer.

**Strategy:**

This offer allows for negotiation while still securing a good price. I'm aiming to find a middle ground where Bob sees value in the deal, but I also don't lose out on too much money. If Bob rejects the offer, I can then assess whether his counteroffer is reasonable or if I should move on to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm not sure I can go as high as $12,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $9,000 is closer to my minimum price of $15,000, it's still significantly lower.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get a better price, but I'm not willing to settle for such a low amount just yet.

**Strategy:**

I believe I can get a better price by making a counteroffer. My goal is to find a compromise that's closer to my desired price without pushing Bob away completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to get for this product.  Would you consider a price of $10,500? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's still a good deal for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I've increased the price from Bob's offer of $9,000 to $10,500. This is a compromise that still allows for negotiation but is closer to my desired price range.
* **Reasoning:** I've provided a justification for my counteroffer, emphasizing the value of the product and aiming to make Bob feel like it's a fair compromise.
* **Positive and encouraging message:** This helps maintain a positive rapport and encourages Bob to consider the counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

By making this counteroffer, I'm demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still holding firm on my desired price.  I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be appealing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm also prepared to make further counteroffers or move on to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $9,000, so I'm offering $9,500. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

**Strategy:**

I believe I can get a better price by making a counteroffer. My goal is to find a compromise that's closer to my desired price without pushing Bob away completely.  I will make a counteroffer that is closer to $10,500 than Bob's current offer, but still lower than my minimum price."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your final concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,000. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, but I'm not going any higher. I'm really hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd like to get a higher price, Bob's offer of $9,500 is still quite a bit lower than my minimum price of $15,000. I've already made several concessions and it seems like we're at an impasse.  

**Strategy:**

It's clear that we won't reach a mutually agreeable price.  It's time to move on and accept John's offer for $15,000, which is my minimum and ensures I don't lose money on this deal."
