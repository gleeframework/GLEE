"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to save a bit more.  I'd be happy to pay $700,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given the value it brings and allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to save a bit more, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. Considering the value the product brings to your business, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $750,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a compromise we can both live with.",750000.0,Alice,3,
