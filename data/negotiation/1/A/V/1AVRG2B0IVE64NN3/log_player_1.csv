Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below your minimum ($120) allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate or accept outright. 
* **Appeal to Value:** Highlighting a ""special price"" or ""limited time"" can make the offer seem more appealing and encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how badly he wants the product."
