Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value and features, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. However, I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While knowing Bob's value is helpful, starting with an offer slightly above his perceived value allows room for negotiation. 
* **Gauge Interest:** The message aims to gauge Bob's interest level. If he's immediately turned off by the $20,000, it suggests he might not be willing to go much higher than his $8,000 valuation. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message emphasizes flexibility and a willingness to negotiate,  encouraging Bob to counter-offer. 
* **Alternative Buyer (John):** Alice has a safety net with John, guaranteeing her a minimum of $15,000. This allows her to be more ambitious in her negotiation with Bob. 

**Overall Strategy:**

Alice's strategy aims to maximize her potential profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation process. By starting high and being open to negotiation, she increases her chances of securing a price closer to her desired outcome."
