Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:** You have a backup offer of $100 from John.

By offering the product to Bob at $140, you are:

* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming for the highest price Bob is likely to accept.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** There's a slight chance Bob might try to negotiate down, but you still have a buffer above your minimum.
* **Avoiding Losing the Sale:** If you start too high (close to $150), you risk Bob rejecting the offer outright."
