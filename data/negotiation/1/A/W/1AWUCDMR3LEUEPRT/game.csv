"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe will be a valuable asset to your business.  My initial price is $1,200,000, reflecting the significant value it holds.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product.  I believe this price reflects the value you're looking to get and allows for a fair profit for you while also meeting my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your willingness to negotiate.  While I value your interest in the product, $900,000 doesn't reflect its full potential value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to meet you halfway.  This price still allows me to achieve a reasonable return while offering you a significant opportunity for growth.  I'm confident we can find an agreement that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $1,050,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $950,000.  This would give you a healthy profit margin while still allowing me to stay within my budget. I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still below the value I need to achieve for this product. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,000,000. This allows for a significant profit for you and still reflects the true value of the product. I believe this is a fair offer, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  While $1,000,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, it's still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $975,000 for the product.  This represents a good compromise that allows for both of us to achieve a positive outcome. I'm confident we can find common ground at this price.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to reach a mutually agreeable price. While I appreciate your offer of $975,000, it falls short of the value I need to achieve. To demonstrate my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $990,000. This price point reflects a significant compromise on my end, while still allowing me to meet my minimum requirements.  I'm confident this is a fair offer that allows for a successful outcome for both of us.",990000.0,Alice,7,
