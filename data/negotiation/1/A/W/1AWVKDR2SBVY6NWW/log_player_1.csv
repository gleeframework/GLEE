Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This is a good starting point because it's  higher than my minimum price but leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges the value Bob sees in the product while still giving me a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While it's higher than John's offer, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11200}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer at $11,200. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still maintain a decent profit.  It's closer to my initial offer, and hopefully, Bob will see the value in accepting this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still lower than I'd prefer, but it's getting closer to my desired price.  At this point, I'd rather take the $10,900 from Bob than risk further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
