Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $130 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90?

You have three options:

Bob's offer:

At this point, Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer.  It's better to take the guaranteed $100 from John than to continue haggling with Bob for a potentially marginal gain."
