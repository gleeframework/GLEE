Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is far outside my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $1,000,000 at this time.  This reflects the value I see in the product, and it's the maximum I can realistically pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
