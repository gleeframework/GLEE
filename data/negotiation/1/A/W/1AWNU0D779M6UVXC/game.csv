"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is far outside my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $1,000,000 at this time.  This reflects the value I see in the product, and it's the maximum I can realistically pay.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $2,300,000 is a significant gap.  I've researched the value this product brings, and I'm confident it can generate substantial returns for you.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a very competitive offer given the product's potential.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still above my budget.  I'm confident this product holds value, but I can only go as high as $1,200,000.  This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I acknowledge your commitment to finding a solution. While $1,900,000 is a fair reflection of the product's worth, I'm ready to consider a compromise.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,550,000?  This would allow us both to benefit from this deal.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
