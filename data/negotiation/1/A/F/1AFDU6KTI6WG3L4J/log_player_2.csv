"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. After considering your potential interest, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still significantly higher than her value of $800,000. There's room for negotiation to get a better price.  Rejecting allows you to make a counteroffer and try to push the price down further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a significant amount, but I'm still confident that the product's value is higher. Considering your interest, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $925000. This price still reflects the product's true worth, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, her counteroffer of $925,000 is still too high. It's important to keep pushing for a lower price. There's still room to negotiate as her value is $800,000 and you're willing to pay up to $1,200,000. By rejecting this offer and sending another counteroffer, you increase the chances of reaching a more favorable agreement."
