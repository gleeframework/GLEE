"Alice, $16,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $8,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your initial offer, but $16,000 is closer to the product's true value. To move this forward, how about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still out of my range. Let's try $10,000. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be worth it for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground. While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to consider $12,500. This offer reflects the product's true worth and is a fair deal for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,5,
