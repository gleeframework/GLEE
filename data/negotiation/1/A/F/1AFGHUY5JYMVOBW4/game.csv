"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiations at $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $900,000 is a great starting point, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. This is still a great deal for both of you, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth the investment. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $875,000 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to offer $860,000. This is a strong offer, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price.",860000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $870,000 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to offer $865,000, which is a compromise that I believe is fair to both of us.  Let's see if we can finally close this deal.",865000.0,Bob,6,
