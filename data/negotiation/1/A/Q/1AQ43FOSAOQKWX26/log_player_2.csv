"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you our premium product for $9,500. This is an exceptional value considering its worth to you is $10,000. I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I'm willing to negotiate further. How about I offer the product to you for $9,000? This still allows for a significant profit for me while remaining competitive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. Considering the value you place on this product, how does $8,950 sound as a final offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,950. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,950
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

At this point, Alice is very slowly coming down while I'm inching up. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better price than $8,950. Accepting the offer secures a reasonable deal."
