Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $10,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, you have room to negotiate. Starting with a higher offer of $10,000 allows you to potentially gain an extra $2,000.
* **Justification:**  The message implies the product's value (""significant value"") without revealing your bottom line. 
* **Urgency:** The ""limited-time offer"" adds a bit of pressure for Bob to decide quickly.

**Important Note:** This is just one approach. There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. You might need to adjust your strategy based on his response."
