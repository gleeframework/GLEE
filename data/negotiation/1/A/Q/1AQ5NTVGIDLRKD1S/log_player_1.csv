"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. Since I know the product is worth at least $150 to me, I'm confident in asking for more. I'm curious to see if Bob is willing to negotiate!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm reducing my price slightly from the initial offer, but it's still well above Bob's offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'm going to try to counteroffer again. I'm starting to get a little nervous that I might have to sell to John, but I'm hoping I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm still holding out for a decent profit. I'm hoping that this offer is attractive enough for Bob to accept. If not, I'm running out of time, and I might have to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm hoping I can get him to go a little higher. I'm starting to feel the pressure, though. I might have to sell to John soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm making a small concession, but I'm still hoping to get a good price.  I'm running out of rounds, so I need to be more flexible.  I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a good deal and finally accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but we're running out of rounds. I don't want to risk another rejection and potentially miss out on a sure sale to John. I'm going to sell to John for $150, which is a good price and ensures I get a decent profit."
