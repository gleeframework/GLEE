Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still settle above your minimum.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $12,000 provides a safety net, allowing you to be firm in negotiations with Bob."
