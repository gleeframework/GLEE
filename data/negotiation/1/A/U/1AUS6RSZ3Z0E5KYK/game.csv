"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this high-quality product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Would you be willing to consider that price?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $8250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $7500, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $7500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
