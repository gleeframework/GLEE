Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. I'm offering it to you for $140.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's still quite a bit higher than what Bob values the product at. It's high enough to potentially earn you a decent profit but leaves room for negotiation. By including a friendly message, you're also trying to establish a rapport and make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I am only able to pay up to $100 for it. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to you. Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and gives you the chance to push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest!  While $100 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $120.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. I am still not able to meet at $120, but I would be willing to pay $110 for the product. Let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $110 is still a bit lower than what you'd prefer, it's getting closer to your minimum acceptable price. It's also a good opportunity to avoid the risk of a further negotiation breakdown.  Further negotiation with Bob might lead to a lower price, and selling to John is a guaranteed $150, but a sure sale with Bob will bring in more money than continuing to negotiate."
