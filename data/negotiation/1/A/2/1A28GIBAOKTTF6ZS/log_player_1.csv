Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking $175 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, knowing Bob likely won't accept it immediately.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering to negotiate shows flexibility and encourages Bob to engage further.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me leverage to potentially push Bob higher, knowing I have a guaranteed $150 if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob's offer is not acceptable, it shows he's interested and willing to negotiate.
* **Leveraging John:** I have a guaranteed $150 with John, giving me the power to reject Bob's offer and counter with a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:** $140 is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Show willingness to compromise:**  By coming down from my initial offer, I show flexibility and encourage Bob to reconsider.
* **Emphasize value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's value might incentivize him to accept the counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $140 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob has come up from his initial offer, $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Limited negotiation potential:**  We've already negotiated a few rounds, and Bob is not showing much willingness to move closer to my price.
* **John is a safe alternative:** I have a guaranteed $150 from John, which is a better outcome than accepting Bob's offer.  Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a better result."
