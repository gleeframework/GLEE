Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly lower than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're still making a profit, and it leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **It's clear and concise:**  Bob understands the offer and the price immediately.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is a better deal than selling to John,  I can likely do better than that.  Bob is clearly interested and the product is worth more to him than to me, so there's room for negotiation. I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? I'm confident you'll still find this a great deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go up to $110, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we do $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$105 is a good compromise.  It's above my minimum, and it's likely the best I can get from Bob.  I'd rather secure a sale than risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a lower price."
