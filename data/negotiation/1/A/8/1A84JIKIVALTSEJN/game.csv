"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd like to propose $1,300,000 as a starting point. This would still be a good deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle at $1,350,000. This price takes into account the value you've placed on the product, while also ensuring I can make a reasonable profit. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
