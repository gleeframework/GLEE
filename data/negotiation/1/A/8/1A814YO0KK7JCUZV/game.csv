"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price point is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  To be honest, $1,000,000 is the very top of my budget for this.  If you're willing to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
