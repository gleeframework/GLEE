Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable price:** This leaves you room to negotiate downwards if Bob rejects your initial offer.

By starting with this offer, I'm hoping to start a dialogue with Bob and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. If not, I can always fall back on John's offer of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'm interested in purchasing, but I'd be happy to offer you $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I still have the option to sell to John for $12,000 if negotiations with Bob break down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest,  $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer.  How about $9,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit outside of my budget. How about we settle on $9,000? It's a fair price considering both our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  It's also very likely that if I reject this offer, Bob will either walk away or offer a price even lower than $9,000.  Accepting his offer guarantees me a sale at a price that's reasonably close to my target."
