"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'm interested in purchasing, but I'd be happy to offer you $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest,  $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer.  How about $9,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit outside of my budget. How about we settle on $9,000? It's a fair price considering both our positions.",9000.0,Bob,4,
