"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $130, which is above my minimum of $100 but leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially earn more while also being reasonable in the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $105 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price. How about $120? That gives you a good deal while also allowing me to cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you accept $112.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $112.50 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum price and closer to my original asking price.  I'm willing to accept this offer and close the deal."
