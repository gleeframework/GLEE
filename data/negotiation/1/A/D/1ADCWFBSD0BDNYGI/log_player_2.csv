"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is slightly higher than your ideal price of $100, it's still a good deal. You save $5 compared to buying from John.  Continuing the negotiation carries the risk that Alice might increase her price, leading to a worse outcome."
