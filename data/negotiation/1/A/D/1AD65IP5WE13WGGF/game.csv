"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product.  While it seems nice, $150 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you. However, I have to make a profit, so I can offer you a compromise. I can sell it to you for $135.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the movement on price, Alice.  However, $135 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Could you meet me halfway at $105?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. I can see that $105 is still a bit lower than my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $130 for the product. How about we meet at $125?",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but that's still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $110, but that's my limit.",110.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $110, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $128 for the product. How about we meet at $128?",128.0,Alice,7,
