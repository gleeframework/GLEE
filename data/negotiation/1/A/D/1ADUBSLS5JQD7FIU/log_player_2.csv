The product is worth $80 to you, and Alice's offer is $90.  You can do better than that. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price that is lower than Alice's offer but still within your budget. You are aiming to save as much money as possible, so a lower price is always preferred."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice's offer is closer to your target, it's still higher than what you are willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if you can get a better price."

This offer is your final price. You are willing to pay $80, which is the maximum you're willing to spend and the price John is offering. This should be your final counteroffer before going with John's offer if Alice rejects."
