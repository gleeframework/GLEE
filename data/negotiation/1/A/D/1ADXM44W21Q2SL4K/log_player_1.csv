Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than his initial offer, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, I'm looking for a price closer to $11,000. This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your latest offer. How about $10,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,250 is a better offer than previous ones, it's still below my minimum target. I'm not willing to sell it for less than $15,000 and will continue to negotiate with Bob to see if we can reach a price closer to my target.  I will make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  However, $10,250 is still too far below what I need to get for this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm not going lower than $10,750. This is a fair compromise, and it allows you to get a great deal. Let's settle this now."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down further, but $10,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,750 and my previous offer of $10,250. How about $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting close, but Bob is still offering a price significantly lower than my minimum. I've reached a point where I'm not sure if I can get him to my desired price.  I've already lost several rounds and I'm getting closer to the end.  The risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob is that I might run out of time and end up selling the product for a lower price than I'd like. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
