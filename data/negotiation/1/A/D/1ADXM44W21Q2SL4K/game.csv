"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, I'm looking for a price closer to $11,000. This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your latest offer. How about $10,250?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  However, $10,250 is still too far below what I need to get for this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm not going lower than $10,750. This is a fair compromise, and it allows you to get a great deal. Let's settle this now.",10750.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down further, but $10,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,750 and my previous offer of $10,250. How about $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,6,
