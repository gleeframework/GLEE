"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the investment. I'm willing to start with a price of $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $12000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you have a budget constraint, Bob. However, I believe the product's value is worth more than $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $10500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand the product's value, $10500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000, which is a fair price considering the market value and my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I get a decent return on my investment. I'm counteroffering at $10000. This is the lowest price I can consider, and it's still above what you initially offered. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",10000.0,Alice,5,
