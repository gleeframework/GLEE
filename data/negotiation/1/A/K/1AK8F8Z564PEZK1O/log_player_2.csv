"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the investment. I'm willing to start with a price of $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. It's way too high and you're trying to save as much money as possible. It's worth exploring other options before committing to such a high price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $12,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you have a budget constraint, Bob. However, I believe the product's value is worth more than $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $10500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is closer to your budget, it's still more than you're comfortable paying. It's worth negotiating further to see if you can reach a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand the product's value, $10,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000, which is a fair price considering the market value and my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I get a decent return on my investment. I'm counteroffering at $10000. This is the lowest price I can consider, and it's still above what you initially offered. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $10,000 is still higher than your budget. You've tried negotiating, but it seems unlikely she'll go lower than that.  Since you have the option of buying the product from John for $8,000, it makes more sense to take that option and save yourself $2,000."
