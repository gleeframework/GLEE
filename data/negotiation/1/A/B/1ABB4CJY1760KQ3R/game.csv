"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $20,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $18,000 for you. I believe this product will exceed your expectations and be well worth the investment.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $18,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  Would you consider $14,000? That's the highest I can go.",14000.0,Bob,4,
