"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $14,000 is a good offer, I'm not yet satisfied with the price. I want to see if Bob is willing to go higher before considering selling to John. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm counter-offering with $14,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, signaling that I'm open to negotiation but still aiming for a price closer to my initial value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,500 is approaching my minimum value, I'm still hesitant to accept. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can squeeze out a slightly higher price.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $14,000.  This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer,  and hopefully shows I'm serious about getting a price closer to my desired value. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come up a bit more before I have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still not ready to accept $13,000.  I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get a slightly higher price. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counter-offering with $13,500. This is a compromise between my minimum value and Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this shows that I'm serious about reaching a deal, but I'm also not willing to go any lower. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

At this point, I'm getting close to my minimum value, but Bob's offers are not increasing significantly. With only three rounds left, I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed sale to John.  Selling to John for $10,000 is a safe option that ensures I get at least my minimum value."
