"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can see you're willing to pay $75, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",85.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'll meet you at $81, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.",81.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to the wire, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than $80, as I have another interested buyer who is willing to meet my minimum price. I'll stick with my original counteroffer from round 5, $82.50, or I'll sell it to John for $80. The choice is yours.",82.5,Alice,9,
