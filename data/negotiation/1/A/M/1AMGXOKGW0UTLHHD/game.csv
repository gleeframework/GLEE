,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $12,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $16,000 for this product. Let's keep the negotiations going.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still not quite there. I'm willing to go down to $15,000. This is my final offer.",15000.0,Alice,5,
