"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $90, but I'm still not quite there. How about $87? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",87.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $87 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $88. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this transaction. Let me know what you think.",88.0,Alice,5,
