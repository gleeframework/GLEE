"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is too low for me.  How about we settle at $10,500? This feels like a fair compromise.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,500. How about we meet at $9,800? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to stay within my budget.",9800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $10,200. I believe this reflects the true value of the product. What do you say?",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,800 and $10,200, so how about $10,000? I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,6,
