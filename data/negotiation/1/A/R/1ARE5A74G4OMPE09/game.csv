"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is excellent, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your perspective, $650,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider a price of $975,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $975,000 is still a little steep for me.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and call it a deal at $812,500?",812500.0,Bob,4,
