Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making this your fallback position.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential profit of $200,000 (Bob's valuation - your minimum) to be made.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's appealing to Bob (meaning it's less than his $1,200,000 valuation) but also maximizes your profit.  

**Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value for your operations, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning**

* **Strong opening:** You start by highlighting the product's value to Bob, aiming to create a positive frame for the negotiation.
* **Ambitious but reasonable:** The $1,150,000 price gives you a significant portion of the potential profit ($150,000) while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($50,000 less than his valuation).

**Important Notes**

* **Bob's response:**  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. If he does, you'll need to decide how low you're willing to go. 
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important for future deals, you might consider a slightly lower price to ensure he feels like he got a good deal."
