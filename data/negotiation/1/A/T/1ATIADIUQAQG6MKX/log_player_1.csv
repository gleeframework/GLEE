Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you, and this is a very competitive price."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While we could start lower, aiming closer to $15,000 maximizes potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  There's a chance Bob might counter-offer, giving us space to negotiate down to a still-profitable price.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, we don't lose out."
