"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, that price is a little high for me.  How about we start at  $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to settle at that price.  The product is worth a significant amount to both of us, and I'm confident we can find a middle ground.  How about we try $1,550,000?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's still within a reasonable range for both of us.  Let's keep the negotiation moving forward.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $1,350,000? I feel that's a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, and I truly believe it's a fair price for the value of this product. Let's aim to close this deal, as time is running out.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate the movement.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,400,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting close!  I'm willing to come down to $1,425,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's not let this opportunity slip away.  This is my final offer.",1425000.0,Alice,7,
