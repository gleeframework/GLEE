"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Accepting Alice's offer:**  You pay $950,000, saving $250,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer:** You'll have to buy from John, paying the full $1,200,000. 
* **Buying from John:**  This is the most expensive option and doesn't make sense if you have the option of accepting Alice's lower offer."
