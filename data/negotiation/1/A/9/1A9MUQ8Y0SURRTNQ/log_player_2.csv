"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, you can potentially save more by counter-offering.  You know the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point because it's halfway between your maximum budget ($10,000) and Alice's initial offer ($11,000). It shows you are serious about buying but also leaves room for some negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,750 is only $750 more than what you're willing to pay from John.  Since there's a chance Alice will reject another counteroffer and you might end up paying the same amount to John, accepting this offer is the best choice. You save a bit of time and effort by closing the deal now."
