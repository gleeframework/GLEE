Round 7
Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your target, it's still above your maximum. You have 3 rounds left and should continue to negotiate for a lower price. You could try a counteroffer slightly higher than your target, such as $850,000, or even $875,000, to show your willingness to close the deal while still trying to get a better price. However, remember that if you don't get a satisfactory offer, you can always choose to buy from John."

Round 9

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

You've reached a point where the negotiation is getting tedious and Alice's offers are still above your budget.  You have one round left, and while you could try another counteroffer, it's unlikely Alice will budge further. It's a better strategy to buy from John at $800,000, which is within your budget and guarantees a deal."
