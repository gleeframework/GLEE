"That's a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $100? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a tight budget, but I have to make a profit. I can meet you in the middle at $140, but that's as low as I can go.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, but $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $120.  If we can agree on that, I'll take it today.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $120 is still a bit low for me. I can offer you a slight discount at $135, but that's the lowest I can go.",135.0,Alice,5,
