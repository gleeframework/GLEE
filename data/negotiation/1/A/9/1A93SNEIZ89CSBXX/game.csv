"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's valued at $1500000 to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $1400000. This represents a significant opportunity for you, considering its worth to you is $1200000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1250000 is significantly below my minimum price point. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to see a figure closer to $1350000 to move forward. This is a fair price, considering the value to you and the market value of the product.  Let's find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
