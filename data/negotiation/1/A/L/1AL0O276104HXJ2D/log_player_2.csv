# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value, potentially even exceeding $800000. I'm confident it could be a game-changer for you. I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $1000000, but I'm open to discussing the price further.  Please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's a good deal, allowing you to save $200,000 compared to buying from John.  While you don't know Alice's valuation of the product, it's in your best interest to accept this offer."
