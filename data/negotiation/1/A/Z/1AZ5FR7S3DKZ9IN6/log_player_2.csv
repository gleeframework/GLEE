"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Considering its value and the benefits it offers, I propose a price of $950,000 for this exceptional opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  I have 10 rounds to negotiate and can always opt to buy from John. There's a good chance I can get a better deal by rejecting and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $950,000 is slightly outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this price is fair, given the value I see in your product and my budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in our product. To better align with your budget while still ensuring fair compensation for our efforts and investment in the product, I am proposing a price of $975,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to my ideal price, but $975,000 is still over my budget. I'm willing to keep negotiating, especially since I've only had three rounds and there's a chance I can get closer to $900,000.  I can always buy from John if the negotiations fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $975,000 is closer, it's still outside my comfortable range. I'm confident that $925,000 is a fair price that reflects the value of your product and allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's meet halfway and see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your continued interest and for your offer. After careful consideration, I am pleased to present a counteroffer of $950,000 for the product. This price reflects a compromise that respects both the value of our product and your budgetary constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has returned to her initial offer of $950,000. While this is still above my ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise considering we're halfway through the negotiation rounds.  It's also better than buying from John at $1,000,000. I'm taking the offer to secure the product and avoid the risk of further negotiation or missing out on the deal altogether."
