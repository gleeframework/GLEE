Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $700,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $800,000 with further negotiation."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $700,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $775,000 for the product. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $775,000 is getting closer to my target, I'm still not quite there. I believe I can push for a slightly higher price in the next round."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $795,000 is very close to my minimum, I'm only two rounds away from being able to sell to John for $800,000. I want to see if I can squeeze out a little more from Bob before I take that option."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000. Bob's offer of $785,000 is close, but I'm not confident I can get him to go higher in the next round, and selling to John guarantees me my minimum target price."
