"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as I'm sure you'll agree. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $13,000 is lower than your maximum price of $15,000. 
* This means you can save $2,000 compared to buying from John. 
* While the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, it's worth $15,000 to you, so you're still getting a good deal."
