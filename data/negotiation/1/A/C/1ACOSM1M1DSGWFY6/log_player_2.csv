"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your offer significantly undervalues the true potential of this product.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a very competitive price considering the long-term benefits you'll reap.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $2,000,000 is still outside of my acceptable range. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it fairly reflects the product's potential benefits. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  However, we're still a considerable distance apart.  I'm willing to accept $1,800,000, as this represents a significant concession on my end.  This is my final offer, as I believe it's more than fair given the product's potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,800,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget.  Although Alice has stated this is her final offer, Bob should continue negotiating. It's important to see if there is any further room for compromise, as buying from John at $1,500,000 is still an option."

Let's work together to reach an agreement before time runs out."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
