"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a perfect fit for your needs. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $14,000. This is a significant discount considering its value. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This price still represents a significant discount for a product of this quality. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I've considered your offer, Alice, but I'm still looking to keep my expenses within my set budget. Could we possibly work towards a price closer to $12,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise given the value of the product.",12000.0,Bob,4,
