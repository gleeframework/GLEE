Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits it holds. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

Here's the reasoning behind this offer:

* **High starting point:** Knowing Bob's valuation is lower than yours and having a guaranteed backup offer, you can start high. 
* **Room for negotiation:** The $1,300,000 price leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification for the price:**  The message emphasizes ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential benefits"" to justify the high price without revealing specific details about your minimum acceptable price. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider."
