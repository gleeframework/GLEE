"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Its value is substantial, and I believe it has the potential to be a game-changer for you. To start our discussion, I'm proposing a price of $1500000.  This reflects the product's unique capabilities and the significant benefit it can bring to your business. I'm open to discussing further, but I'm confident this price is a fair reflection of its worth. Let's talk!",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's capabilities and the potential benefits it can bring to my business.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $900000 is a good starting point, it doesn't quite reflect the true value this product offers.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This price still allows for significant profit potential for you and recognizes the unique capabilities of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to come down, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1100000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that recognizes the product's value while staying within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
