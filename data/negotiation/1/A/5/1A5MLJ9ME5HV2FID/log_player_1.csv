"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but not drastically so. This leaves room for negotiation while still being profitable for me. 
* **Framing the Offer:** I'm framing the offer in terms of value to Bob's business to encourage him to consider the benefits of the product.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The price is not my absolute bottom line, allowing for adjustments in later rounds. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to maximize profit within the 10 rounds. I'll closely monitor Bob's responses and adjust my offers accordingly, while keeping John's offer of $1,500,000 as my safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired value.
* **Selling to John:** While John's offer is tempting, it's not my ideal outcome.  I want to explore if I can achieve a higher price with Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired value but still below my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility while remaining firm on my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,400,000 is simply too low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,600,000. This still allows me to get a fair return on my investment while recognizing the value you see in the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by lowering my price, but not by too much. This shows flexibility without undermining my position. 
* **Framing the Offer:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of my counteroffer, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and potentially pushing him to be more agreeable.
* **Maintaining My Minimum:**  $1,600,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose too much in this negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to close the deal in this round or the next. By offering a reasonable compromise, I hope to convince Bob to accept. If he rejects again, I'll assess if further negotiation is worthwhile or if I should accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product, but that's as high as I can go. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price and aligns with John's offer. 
* **Closing the Deal:** Accepting this offer ensures I get my desired price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation, which could lead to a lower price or a breakdown in the deal. 
* **Time Factor:** We are already in round 4, and time is a factor in this negotiation.  Accepting the offer allows me to close the deal quickly.

**Strategy:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice in this situation. It guarantees my minimum profit and minimizes potential risks associated with further negotiation."
