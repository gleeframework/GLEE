"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a product that I believe you'll find valuable.  Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $9,000.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $10,000. You can get the product for less by rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
