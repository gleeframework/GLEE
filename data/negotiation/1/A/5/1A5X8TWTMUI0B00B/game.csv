"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a serious offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  Given the value I see in it, I'm willing to offer $750,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $850,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try to split the difference. I'm willing to offer $800,000.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we're getting close, but I'm not ready to give up on the extra $50,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000. This is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me here, I think we can make a deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,
