"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a serious offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's significantly above what the product is worth to her ($800,000), indicating there's room for negotiation. 
* **There's time for negotiation.** We have 10 rounds, so it's worth exploring if a better price can be reached.
* **Buying from John is a last resort.**  John's price is the absolute maximum we're willing to pay, so we should only consider that option if all else fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  Given the value I see in it, I'm willing to offer $750,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $850,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is moving in the right direction.**  Her offer is lower than her initial price, which is good. 
* **There's still room for a better deal.**  $850,000 is still significantly higher than my initial counteroffer ($750,000).  
* **Buying from John is still a last resort.** I want to exhaust all options with Alice before considering that. 

I'll counteroffer again, trying to bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try to split the difference. I'm willing to offer $800,000.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that we're getting close, but I'm not ready to give up on the extra $50,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000. This is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me here, I think we can make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to our ideal price.** We're only $25,000 away from our initial counteroffer of $800,000.
* **Alice has declared this her ""final offer.""**  There's a risk that if we reject, she might not come down further, and we could end up paying more later.
* **Buying from John is still a worse deal.**  At $825,000, we're saving a significant amount compared to John's price.

While it's tempting to keep negotiating, the risk of losing the deal or ending up with a worse price outweighs the potential gain of $25,000.  We're better off securing the product at this price."
