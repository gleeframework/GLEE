Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  Given the value I see in it, I'm willing to offer $750,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.
