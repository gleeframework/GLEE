Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you at a special discounted price of $13,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm hoping this offer makes it an easy decision."", 
""product_price"": 13500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will pay $15,000, securing a deal with Bob above our minimum ($15,000) is ideal. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $13,500 creates a win-win scenario. It's significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($12,000), giving him a strong incentive to accept. At the same time, it nets us a profit above our minimum.
* **Direct and Encouraging:** The message is crafted to be appealing without revealing our hand entirely. We highlight the ""special discounted price"" to create a sense of urgency and value."
