"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $9,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,750. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're firm on your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $10,250. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
