"Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $800,000 to you, and Alice is offering it for $700,000, it's a good deal. However, you want to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 650000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Alice $650,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from her initial offer of $700,000, but it's still within my budget and leaves some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's new offer of $675,000 is a good compromise. While I would prefer to pay less, further negotiation might not yield a significantly better price and could risk losing the deal altogether.  This price is within my budget and saves me $125,000 compared to buying from John."
