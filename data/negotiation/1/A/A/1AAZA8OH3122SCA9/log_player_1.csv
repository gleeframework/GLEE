Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $900,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:**  My message is friendly and emphasizes the potential benefit for Bob. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm not aiming for an immediate acceptance, allowing for a potential back-and-forth that could lead to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **John as a backup:** I'm keeping John in mind as a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail.

This approach aims to maximize my profit while still considering the possibility of a successful negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $750,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Potential for negotiation:** While Bob's budget is limited, his interest in the product suggests there's room for negotiation. 
* **John as a backup:**  I still have John as a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, providing me with a strong fallback position.

**Next step:** I will send Bob a counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap between our positions while maintaining a profitable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, recognizing your interest in the product. This price is still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll receive.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** I'm offering $850,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasizing value:** I reiterate the value Bob will gain from the product to make my offer more appealing.
* **Finding common ground:** I use a positive tone and express a desire to reach a mutually agreeable solution.

This counteroffer aims to find a compromise that's closer to my desired price while still being attractive to Bob, increasing the chances of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $850,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825,000. Can we discuss this further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  $825,000 is only $75,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  While I would prefer more, Bob's offer shows he's willing to negotiate and might be open to a slightly higher price in the future.
* **Time and effort:**  Further negotiation could be time-consuming and potentially lead to a stalemate.

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale and secures a reasonable profit. While I could try for a higher price, the risk of losing the deal altogether outweighs the potential gains."
