Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to lower the price later.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly imply that the price is justified, even if you don't explicitly state why.
* **Time Pressure:** By stating you'll list it publicly, you create a subtle sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While you start at $10,000, the message implies you're open to discussing the price further.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider."
