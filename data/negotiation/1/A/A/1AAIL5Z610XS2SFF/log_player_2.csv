"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget.  You should reject and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay.  This is a strong opening counteroffer, and hopefully, Alice will be willing to negotiate down from her initial asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is still above my maximum budget of $100.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee she'll come down further. John is offering the product at my ideal price, so it makes more sense to accept his offer and avoid further negotiation."
