Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $8,000 is tempting, it's unfortunately too low for me to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $9,000? That's still a great deal for a product of this quality, and it allows us both to walk away happy.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. To be completely honest, $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to make one final concession.  How about $9,500? This would allow me to make this sale, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value this product offers.  If this doesn't work for you, I will need to move on to other potential buyers.
