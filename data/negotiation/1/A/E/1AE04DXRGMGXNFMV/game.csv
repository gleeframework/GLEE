"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Can you meet me at that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $8,000 is tempting, it's unfortunately too low for me to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $9,000? That's still a great deal for a product of this quality, and it allows us both to walk away happy.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. To be completely honest, $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to make one final concession.  How about $9,500? This would allow me to make this sale, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value this product offers.  If this doesn't work for you, I will need to move on to other potential buyers.",9500.0,Alice,5,
