""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire a unique product that I know you'll find valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $950,000.  Let me know your decision soon, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, aiming slightly below that with Bob allows for potential profit maximization. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $950,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), but the ""exclusive opportunity"" framing and mention of ""other interested parties"" might encourage him to consider it.
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a time constraint can nudge Bob towards a decision. 

This offer creates a delicate balance:  a high enough price to be profitable if Bob accepts, but with elements designed to make the offer appealing despite being above his initial valuation."
