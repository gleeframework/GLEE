"I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I'm willing to start with a price of $950,000, which I believe is a fair and reasonable price considering its worth to you.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in this product, but $950,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I can meet you halfway at $825,000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make to move the deal forward.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However, I'm still a ways off from that price point. Would you consider $750,000? I think that's a fair offer.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer, but I still need to make a profit. I can offer you a slight discount to $815,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is my final offer on the high end for now.",815000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, $800,000 is as high as I can go.  If you're unable to meet that, I understand, but I'm hoping we can make a deal.",800000.0,Bob,6,
