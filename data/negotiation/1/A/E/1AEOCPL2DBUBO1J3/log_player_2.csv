"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has a maximum budget of $1,200,000, and Alice is willing to sell for at least $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  Offering $1,100,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer while still leaving room for a potential compromise. This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate while also making a strong opening move."
