"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. $200 is above his maximum budget of $150. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within his budget. This shows that he is serious about negotiating and is hoping to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $140 is a bit too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $170? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $170 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $150.  He should reject the offer and continue negotiating to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $170 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $155, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 155}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his maximum budget, but still wants to save some money. He's offering a price that is within his budget and is likely to be more appealing to Alice, as it's closer to her desired price.  He's also trying to emphasize a fair price for both of them to further encourage acceptance."
