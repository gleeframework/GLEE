Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $20,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This initial offer starts high, aiming to maximize potential profit. It also emphasizes the product's unique value to pique Bob's interest.  Since you don't know Bob's valuation, starting high leaves room for negotiation without immediately losing potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $15000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is the minimum acceptable, it's likely you can do better.  There's still room to negotiate, so rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While $15,000 is my minimum, I believe the product's value justifies a slightly higher price. How about $17,500? It's a fair compromise and still leaves room for both of us to be happy."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $17500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $16250. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,250 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and it's likely that further negotiation will only result in smaller increments. Accepting his offer maximizes your potential profit while also ensuring a quick and relatively smooth sale."
