"Bob, I understand you're looking to pay closer to $8,500, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,250. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle at $8,750. This would be a fair price for both of us and I believe we can close the deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
