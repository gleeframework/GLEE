Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1350000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than your desired price.  You can continue negotiating to try and get a lower price. You still have room to bargain before having to resort to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I need to make a profit, and $1175000 is still a bit short of that. I'm willing to meet you at $1225000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the profit I need to make. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,225,000 is still significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000. 
* You've already rejected a few offers, and it's likely further negotiation will only result in more back-and-forth, potentially leading to Alice walking away.
* Accepting this offer allows you to secure the product at a good price without risking further delays or losing the deal completely."
