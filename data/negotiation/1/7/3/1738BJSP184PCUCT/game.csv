"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. I'm interested, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $1000000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1350000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1350000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1175000?  This price would give us both a good deal, and I'm confident you'd still be able to make a profit.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I need to make a profit, and $1175000 is still a bit short of that. I'm willing to meet you at $1225000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the profit I need to make.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
