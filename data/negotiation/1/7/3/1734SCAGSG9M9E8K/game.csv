"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is more than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $1000000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1000000 is a significant offer, but I was really hoping to get a bit more for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1200000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'll offer $1100000 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1100000. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make a decent profit. How about $1150000?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1150000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to go.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1100000.  This price is fair and would allow both of us to get what we want.  Let's make this deal happen!",1100000.0,Bob,6,
