"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the chance to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will greatly benefit you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations, considering its long-term value."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to begin negotiations with an offer above your desired selling price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique value"" and ""long-term value,"" the message subtly justifies the high initial price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The phrase ""fair starting point for negotiations"" signals to Bob that you are open to discussing the price further.

This strategy aims to:
* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Ideally, Bob accepts the high initial offer.
* **Understand Bob's Position:**  His response will indicate how eager he is to acquire the product and how much he might be willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is significantly closer to his perceived value of the product ($800,000), it's still considerably below your minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and John's standing offer. There's room for negotiation, and you're better off seeing if you can negotiate a better deal with Bob before accepting an offer below your minimum or going with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value this product brings.  However, $950,000 is a significant gap from where I see this deal landing.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price reflects the inherent worth of the product and its potential to deliver substantial returns."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's Offer:** It's important to acknowledge Bob's counter-offer to show you're taking his perspective into consideration and are negotiating in good faith.
* **Firm but Flexible:** While significantly lowering the initial asking price, this counter-offer still keeps the price well above both Bob's initial offer and your absolute minimum. This signals flexibility but also firmness on your end. 
* **Reiterating Value:**  By again highlighting the potential returns, the message subtly reminds Bob of the product's long-term benefits, justifying a higher price. 
 
This strategy aims to:

* **Find a Middle Ground:**  You're moving towards a potential compromise while still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Maintain Negotiating Power:**  By making a substantial move, you put the ball back in Bob's court and encourage him to make a similarly significant counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm proposing $1,150,000. This price is a compromise that I believe is more in line with my expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering $1,150,000, which is a significant increase from his initial offer and well above your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  

While you could potentially push for a bit more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might:

* Become frustrated and walk away from the negotiation.
* Dig in his heels, making only incremental increases.

Accepting the $1,150,000 offer guarantees a substantial profit and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely by trying to extract a little more."
