{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us - you get a valuable asset at a good price, and I get a fair return on my investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're not giving away the product for less than your minimum of $800,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's a gap between your offer and Bob's potential value, allowing for potential counteroffers.
* **It's a fair starting point:** You're not being overly aggressive, which could scare Bob away. 

Remember, the key is to be firm but also open to negotiation.  You want to maximize your profit, but also keep Bob engaged in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  This would still be a good profit for you and a great price for me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my desired price point. I believe I can secure a better deal by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still gives you a significant savings over the product's true value, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
