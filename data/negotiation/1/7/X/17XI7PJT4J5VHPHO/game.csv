"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $850,000 is a bit high for me. Could you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your interest, $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $750,000? This still gives you a good deal, and allows me a reasonable profit. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
