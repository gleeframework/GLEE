"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer you a great deal on it. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to get your hands on this amazing product at a discounted price. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $11,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  This would give you a decent profit while still being a good deal for me.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your proposal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer you the product for $11,200. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a decent profit. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your need to make a profit, but $11,200 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $10,750? It's a good compromise that's closer to both of our desired prices. What do you think?",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,750. I'm willing to make another small concession and offer you the product for $11,300. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a decent profit. What do you think?",11300.0,Alice,7,
