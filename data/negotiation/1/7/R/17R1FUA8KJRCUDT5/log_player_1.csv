"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, but also takes into account my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,350,000?  This price acknowledges the value you'll be gaining while still reflecting the true worth of this product."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to propose a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also being mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

Bob is still significantly undercutting the product's value to him. While we are getting closer to John's offer, there's still room to negotiate before settling."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find the right price, but I need you to understand the significant value this product holds. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,275,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the potential return on investment you'll be receiving."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be careful with my budget. I'm proposing a price of $1,225,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While we could continue negotiating, Bob is clearly firm on his budget constraints. Accepting his offer of $1,225,000 is a significant profit over John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in future rounds."
