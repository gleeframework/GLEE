"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, but also takes into account my budget constraints.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,350,000?  This price acknowledges the value you'll be gaining while still reflecting the true worth of this product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to propose a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also being mindful of my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the right price, but I need you to understand the significant value this product holds. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,275,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the potential return on investment you'll be receiving.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be careful with my budget. I'm proposing a price of $1,225,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
