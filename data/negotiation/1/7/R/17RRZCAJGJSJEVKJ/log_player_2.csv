"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm excited to see if we can make a deal.  To start things off, I'm offering the product at $2,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the opening offer. That's a bit higher than I'm looking to spend. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product."",
 ""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price but well within my budget. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a sense of her flexibility.
* **Aiming High:** My goal is to save as much as possible.  While I have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, there's a chance I can get a better deal from Alice with some skillful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $800,000 is simply too low. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it can make a real difference for you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value this product offers, but $1,800,000 is still outside my budget. Let's find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $950,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Incrementally:** I'm increasing my offer to show Alice I'm serious but staying well below her price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is getting closer to my fallback option of buying from John at $1,000,000. It puts pressure on Alice to consider whether it's worth continuing negotiations if the difference is minimal. 
* **Testing Alice's Flexibility:**  By now, we should get a better read on how much Alice is willing to move on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our valuations remains substantial.  I'm willing to make one more aggressive move to close this deal quickly.  My final offer is $1,600,000. This is a significant discount from my original asking price, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is unlikely to budge:** Alice has framed this as her ""final offer"" and a ""significant discount."" This suggests she's not willing to go much lower.
* **Minimal potential savings vs. risk:** Even if Alice were to come down slightly in further negotiations, the potential savings are small compared to the guaranteed savings of buying from John. 
* **Time is a factor:** We're already past the halfway point in the negotiation. Continuing the negotiation with Alice increases the risk of not reaching a deal and losing the opportunity to buy from John.

It's better to secure a guaranteed saving of $600,000 by going with John than to risk ending up with a much smaller discount or no deal at all."
