"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm excited to see if we can make a deal.  To start things off, I'm offering the product at $2,000,000."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

My goal is to maximize my profit. Since I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000, I need to aim higher with Bob.  Starting with a high but not outrageous offer allows room for negotiation and helps me gauge Bob's willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the opening offer. That's a bit higher than I'm looking to spend. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. Accepting would mean a substantial loss compared to John's offer. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $800,000 is simply too low. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it can make a real difference for you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?"",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Lowball:** Bob's offer was significantly below my minimum. Rejecting it firmly establishes I'm serious about the product's value.
* **Strategic Concession:**  While my price is still high, I've made a substantial drop from my initial offer to show flexibility and encourage Bob to negotiate more seriously.
* **Anchoring:** By staying above $1,500,000, I'm keeping John's offer as a strong fallback option while still aiming for a higher profit with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value this product offers, but $1,800,000 is still outside my budget. Let's find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** While Bob increased his offer, it's still significantly below my $1,500,000 minimum. At this pace, we are unlikely to reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds.
* **John's Offer:** The guaranteed $1,500,000 from John is starting to look more appealing. Continuing to negotiate with Bob has a risk of a lower final sale price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our valuations remains substantial.  I'm willing to make one more aggressive move to close this deal quickly.  My final offer is $1,600,000. This is a significant discount from my original asking price, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Sense of Urgency:** By presenting this as my ""final offer,"" I'm introducing a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to act decisively. 
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  $1,600,000 is a significant price drop, but it allows me to potentially secure a deal with Bob that's still more profitable than John's offer.  
* **Preparing for Alternatives:**  If Bob rejects this offer, it's highly likely we won't reach a deal, and I'll accept John's offer to avoid further time investment."
