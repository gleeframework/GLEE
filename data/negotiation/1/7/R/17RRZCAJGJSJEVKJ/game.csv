"Hi Alice, thanks for the opening offer. That's a bit higher than I'm looking to spend. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $800,000 is simply too low. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it can make a real difference for you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value this product offers, but $1,800,000 is still outside my budget. Let's find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our valuations remains substantial.  I'm willing to make one more aggressive move to close this deal quickly.  My final offer is $1,600,000. This is a significant discount from my original asking price, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
