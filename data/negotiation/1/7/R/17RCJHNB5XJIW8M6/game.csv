"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $1,250,000, which is a fair price given my valuation and your desired price.  I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,275,000. This is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair price considering our previous discussions.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
