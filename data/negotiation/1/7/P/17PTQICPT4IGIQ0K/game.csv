"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my needs. However,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Given the value we both see in this product, I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective. While $1,100,000 represents a fair valuation of the product's potential, I'm willing to move closer to your offer.  How about we settle at $1,025,000? This reflects my effort to find a compromise while still acknowledging the product's significant value.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $987,500 for the product. This represents a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with.",987500.0,Bob,4,
