"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $1,100,000.  Alice values the product at $800,000, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my needs. However,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. Given the value we both see in this product, I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective. While $1,100,000 represents a fair valuation of the product's potential, I'm willing to move closer to your offer.  How about we settle at $1,025,000? This reflects my effort to find a compromise while still acknowledging the product's significant value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, $1,025,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price. There's still room for negotiation to get closer to the $950,000 mark, so rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer is the best course of action."
