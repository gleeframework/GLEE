"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $14,000.  What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 was a bit steep for you, Bob. However, $14,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,000. This is my final counteroffer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $15,000,  which is closer to my budget.  Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",15000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $15,000, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $17,000. This is my last offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",17000.0,Alice,5,
