Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1250000, which is still a good price considering your asking price. Let's see if we can make this work.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $1350000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference: I'm offering $1300000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that we can both agree on.
