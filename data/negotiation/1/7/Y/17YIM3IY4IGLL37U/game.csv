"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the price, I'm not quite ready to accept $1400000.  Given the unique value and potential of this product, I'd be willing to come down to $1750000. This represents a significant discount from my original offer and still allows for a fair return on my investment. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $1750000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1600000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
