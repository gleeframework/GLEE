Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start with a higher price in a negotiation. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counter-offers.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the ""value"" of the product subtly implies it's worth the higher price. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Hinting at listing it ""publicly"" creates a sense of urgency and competition, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.
* **Safety Net:**  Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale at $8,000 from John."
