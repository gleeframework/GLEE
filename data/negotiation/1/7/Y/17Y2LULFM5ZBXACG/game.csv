"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $20,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for it. This is my maximum offer, as I can easily get the same product from John for that price. Let me know if you're open to this.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your position.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet halfway at $17,500?",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,500 is still a bit above my limit. I'm willing to go up to $16,000. If you're not open to this price, I'll have to go with John's offer.",16000.0,Bob,4,
