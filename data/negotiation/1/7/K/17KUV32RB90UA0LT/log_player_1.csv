Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but not so high that it's likely to be immediately rejected. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm happy with $120, I'm not going to accept Bob's first counteroffer. I'm going to try to get a little more for the product.  I'll see if I can get him to budge a little."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to try to split the difference with Bob.  I'll offer him $135, which is halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer. I'm hoping this will be a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has moved closer to my price, and I'm happy to accept his offer for $125. While it's not my initial asking price, it's still a good deal for me and I don't want to risk losing the sale by pushing for more."
