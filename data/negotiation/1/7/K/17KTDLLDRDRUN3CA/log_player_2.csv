"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always advantageous to try and get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This shows that I'm serious about negotiating and willing to walk away if the price isn't right.  $7,000 is still within my budget, but leaves room for potential bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, and $7,500 is a good deal for me.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that she'll either reject my offer or come back with a higher price.  It's better to secure a good deal now than to risk losing it."
