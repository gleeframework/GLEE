"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let you have it for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

You should reject Alice's offer. You can do better than $140, and you should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $130? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I can do $135, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. It's a great product and I think it's worth it to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $135 is a good price.  You've already saved $15 from her original offer and are only $15 above your target price of $120. It's worth accepting the deal to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially having to buy from John for $150."
