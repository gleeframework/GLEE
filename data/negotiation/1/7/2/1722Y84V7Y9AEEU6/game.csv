"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I believe the product's value is not as high as you think it is. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and providing your counterproposal.  While I understand your perspective on the value, I believe $1,400,000 undervalues some of its key features and long-term potential.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $2,000,000.  I think this price point represents a fair deal for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still believe the product's value is not as high as you think it is. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's features and potential, but I'm not willing to go any higher.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
