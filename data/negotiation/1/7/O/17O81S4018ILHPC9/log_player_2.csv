"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you and a fair price for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,250,000. This still gives you a good profit and is a fair price for the product.  Let's work together to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1250000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you.  Let's find a middle ground to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price, ideally closer to his initial counter-offer of $1,250,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need a fair price, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and settle at $1,300,000.  This would give us both a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
