"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you and a fair price for me. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $1250000. This still gives you a good profit and is a fair price for the product.  Let's work together to make this deal happen.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1250000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you.  Let's find a middle ground to close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need a fair price, but $1350000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and settle at $1300000.  This would give us both a good deal.  What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
