"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1500000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1500000 is more than I'm willing to pay at this time. Given the product's potential value to me, I'm prepared to offer $800000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the market value of similar products. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm still a bit concerned that $800000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm thinking of revising my offer to $1200000, which is my minimum price. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'm happy to make the sale. However, if not, I'm open to further negotiations.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1200000 is still outside my budget. While I'm willing to negotiate further, I can't go higher than $900000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'm thinking of revising my offer to $1100000. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
