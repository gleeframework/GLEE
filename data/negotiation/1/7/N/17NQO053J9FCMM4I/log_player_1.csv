Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1500000 is more than I'm willing to pay at this time. Given the product's potential value to me, I'm prepared to offer $800000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the market value of similar products. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

However, I'm still a bit concerned that $800,000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm thinking of revising my offer to $1,200,000, which is my minimum price. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'm happy to make the sale.

This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
