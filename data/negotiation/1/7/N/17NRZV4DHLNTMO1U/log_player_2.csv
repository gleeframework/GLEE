# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is lower than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and still saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John.  Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially advantageous choice."
