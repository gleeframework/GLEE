You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a decent price, there's still room for negotiation.  You can likely get the product for a lower price by making a counteroffer.  It's also worth noting that buying from John would cost you significantly more, making rejection and counteroffering a better strategy."
