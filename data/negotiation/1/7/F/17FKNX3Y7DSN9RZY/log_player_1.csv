Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While Bob's offer is at my minimum, I believe I can get a better price by continuing negotiations."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $8,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which reflects a considerable discount from my initial offer.  This is a fair price considering the unique value of this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8500. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer of $8,500 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum threshold and demonstrates his willingness to negotiate. Accepting this offer secures a decent sale and prevents the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price or a failed deal."
