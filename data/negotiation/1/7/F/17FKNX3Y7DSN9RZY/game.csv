"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $8000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $9000, which reflects a considerable discount from my initial offer.  This is a fair price considering the unique value of this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8500. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",8500.0,Bob,4,
