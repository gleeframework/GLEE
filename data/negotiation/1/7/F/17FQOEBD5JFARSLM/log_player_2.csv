"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth paying $180 for a product you value at $150.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

Starting with a lower price will hopefully make Alice more willing to negotiate.  $130 is a significant discount from her original price and leaves some room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $160 is closer to your desired price, you're still within the negotiation range.  Rejecting allows you to continue bargaining for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This counteroffer is a further compromise, moving closer to Alice's last offer. It's a reasonable price that demonstrates your willingness to negotiate, while still leaving room for Alice to make a small concession."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is slightly above your maximum, it's still a good deal.  You've already made significant progress in the negotiation, and there's a chance Alice won't budge further. Accepting ensures you get the product at a reasonable price without risking a longer negotiation process that could result in you buying from John for the same price."
