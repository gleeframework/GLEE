"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you and the initial offer I made.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. I'm willing to go up to $800000, but I think that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that?",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000.
