"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer!  That price is a little too high for my budget, would you be willing to come down a bit? I was thinking something closer to $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $14,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal. Let me know if you're interested!",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for countering. $14,000 is closer, but still a little high for me.  Could we meet in the middle at $12,000? That's the highest I can go.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is your top limit, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to compromise a bit more. I can offer it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal. Let me know if you're interested!",13500.0,Alice,5,
