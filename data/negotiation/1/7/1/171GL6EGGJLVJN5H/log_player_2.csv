"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than the product's value to you ($110 vs $120).**  
* **You have room to negotiate.** There's a gap between Alice's asking price and what you're willing to pay. 
* **You want to save money.**  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to pay $95 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is within your budget.**  $95 is still below your maximum of $120.
* **It's a significant reduction from Alice's price.** This shows you're serious about negotiating.
* **It leaves room for potential compromise.**  Alice may be willing to meet you halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell, $95 is a bit low for me.  Could you do $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is within your budget.**  $105 is still below your maximum of $120.
* **It's a good compromise.** Alice moved closer to your initial counteroffer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **You're likely to get a better price than John's.**  Buying from Alice at $105 is cheaper than buying from John at $120.

While you could continue to negotiate, the difference between your current offer and Alice's offer is relatively small.  It's likely not worth risking a deal that's within your price range."
