"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,700,000.  This is above Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000 but still leaves some room for negotiation.  It also establishes a strong starting point and encourages Bob to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm countering with $1,600,000. This is still a significant amount above Bob's offer, but closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to make a more favorable counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject his offer and see if he'll come closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,550,000. This is a compromise, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a sign of good faith and make a counteroffer closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where Bob's counteroffers are no longer moving towards a price I'm comfortable with.  Rather than continue negotiating with him and potentially losing more rounds, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This ensures I get my minimum acceptable price and avoids any further risk of losing more money."
