{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts high but is still significantly lower than my minimum value.  It also gives Bob room to negotiate while still leaving me room to make a profit. If Bob rejects, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am willing to pay $9,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but it's still not high enough for me.  I want to see if I can push him a bit higher before settling. I'll counter with a price that's still below my minimum, but closer to Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to go down to $10,500 for the product. This is still a significant discount from what I value it at, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I am willing to pay $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum value, and I'm confident I can't get much more from him. It's a good deal considering my options, and I don't want to risk losing the sale and having to settle with John for my minimum."
