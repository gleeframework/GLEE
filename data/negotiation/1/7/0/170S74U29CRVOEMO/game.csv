"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing a figure that works for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value your offer,  $1,400,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to let it go for $1,750,000.  This reflects the product's true worth and allows me to make a fair deal.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand your position, $1,750,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is a fair price given its value to me. I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
