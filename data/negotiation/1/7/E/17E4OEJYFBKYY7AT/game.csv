"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit out of your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $900,000. This is a fair price that I think reflects the value of the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit in the middle.  However, $900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $950,000? It's still a good price for you, and it's closer to my minimum price.",950000.0,Alice,5,
