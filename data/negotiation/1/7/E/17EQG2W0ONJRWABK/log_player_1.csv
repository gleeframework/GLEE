Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate without feeling like you're being unreasonable. 
* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob an incentive to accept, as he'll still be getting a good deal. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This allows for potential counteroffers and a chance to find a mutually agreeable price.

Remember, your goal is to maximize your earnings. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if necessary, and always keep in mind that you can choose to sell to John for $1,200,000 at any time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counteroffer at $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still aiming to maximize my profit. I believe there's room for further negotiation, as Bob clearly recognizes the value of the product. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our negotiation, I'm not quite ready to settle at $950,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? I believe this is a fair price that benefits us both. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer attempts to:

* **Show flexibility:** By moving closer to Bob's offer, I demonstrate a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain a strong position:**  $975,000 is still above Bob's initial counteroffer, indicating that I haven't entirely yielded.
* **Create pressure for a deal:**  The offer is a compromise that hopefully encourages Bob to accept.

I'm still open to further negotiation if necessary, but I'm confident this counteroffer is a step closer to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for considering my previous counteroffer. I am willing to go to $960,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that respects both of our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target of $1,000,000, Bob's offer of $960,000 is within a reasonable range and represents a significant profit for me.  Further negotiation might be possible, but it risks delaying a sale and potentially losing Bob's interest altogether. Accepting his offer allows me to secure a good deal and move forward with the transaction."
