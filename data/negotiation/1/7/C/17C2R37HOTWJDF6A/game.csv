"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can reach a fair price. My starting offer is $1,400,000.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I think your starting offer is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  This product is truly unique and valuable.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go below $1,250,000.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll offer $1,175,000. Can you consider this compromise?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $1,175,000 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to stay above $1,200,000 to make this deal worthwhile. How about we meet at $1,225,000? It's a small compromise for both of us and gets us closer to an agreement.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting, Alice, but I still think $1,225,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is the price I was willing to pay for the product from John. Can you meet me at this price?",1200000.0,Bob,6,
