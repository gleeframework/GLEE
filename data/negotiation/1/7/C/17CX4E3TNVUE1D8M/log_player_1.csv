"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a fairly high starting point, but I'm hoping to leave room for negotiation if Bob is interested. It also gives me a good starting point to gauge his interest and potential counteroffer. If he rejects, I can then adjust my strategy based on his reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I want to see if Bob is truly serious about buying the product and if he's willing to negotiate. By rejecting his offer, I can then make a counteroffer and see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to be flexible, but still want to get a price closer to my initial asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $12,500. Although this is still lower than my initial asking price, it's only $500 less than what I could get from John.  It's better to secure a sale and avoid any further negotiation risk."
