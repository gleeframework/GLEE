"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $15,000 to you. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $10,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $17,000. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $17,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $13,000? That seems like a fair compromise to me.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $17,000 is still a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering it to you for $16,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  While $16,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we settle right in the middle at $15,500? That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",15500.0,Bob,6,
