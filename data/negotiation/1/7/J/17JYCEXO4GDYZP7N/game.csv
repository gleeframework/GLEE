"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a rare and valuable item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $2000000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you meet me in the middle?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid I won't be able to meet you in the middle at $600000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1800000. Would you be willing to consider that?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, but $1800000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1800000 and $600000, which would be $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $1200000 is still below my target. I'm willing to consider a compromise, but I need to think about it. Let me see... I can do $1600000, but that's as low as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $1600000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1200000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $1200000?",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more offer, but I need to think about my next steps. I can do $1400000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",1400000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one more offer, but $1400000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1400000 and $600000, which is $1000000. I'm hoping we can finally meet at a price we both agree on.",1000000.0,Bob,8,
