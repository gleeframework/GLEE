Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you have room to start high. Aiming for a significant profit margin above Bob's perceived value makes sense.
* **Scarcity and urgency:** Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the product's value to Bob, framing the offer around ""value and potential"" subtly acknowledges its importance. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:** This strategy assumes Bob is potentially motivated by exclusivity and a good deal.  Adjusting your approach based on any prior knowledge of Bob's negotiating style could be beneficial.
* **Risk tolerance:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright. However, the potential reward of a much higher sale price could outweigh this risk."
