"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested,  $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle on $1,000,000? This would give us both a fair deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
