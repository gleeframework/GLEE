"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I'm extending this opportunity to acquire it at an exclusive price of $95. This is a special offer tailored for discerning customers like yourself. I look forward to hearing your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Your Maximum:** You're willing to pay $100 maximum.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is asking $95.
* **John's Price:** You can get the product from John for $100.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can get the product for the same price as John, but you also keep the option of potentially negotiating a lower price with Alice later."
