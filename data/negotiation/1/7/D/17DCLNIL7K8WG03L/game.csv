"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the potential of the product while staying within my financial limits. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is far greater. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This adjustment reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand the value you place on the product, $1,150,000 is still a significant stretch for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's potential while staying within my budget. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
