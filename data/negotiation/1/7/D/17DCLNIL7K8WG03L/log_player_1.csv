Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the potential of the product while staying within my financial limits. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I understand the value you place on the product, $1,150,000 is still a significant stretch for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's potential while staying within my budget. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. Accepting his current offer would be a substantial loss compared to John's guaranteed offer.  It's time to move on to the guaranteed sale."
