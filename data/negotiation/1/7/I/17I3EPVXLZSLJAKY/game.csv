"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's valued at $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiations at $1,300,000.  This price reflects a significant discount, and I believe it's fair considering the value it brings to your business.  What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. This is my maximum budget for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. Can you meet me at this price or is there some flexibility you can offer?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I can't go below $1,200,000. This price still represents a substantial discount from my initial offer and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is my final offer, and I'd like to know if you're willing to accept it.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to go a bit further to close this deal.  $1,150,000 is still a bit below where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,175,000?  This price would allow me to move forward while still giving you a great deal on the product.  Let's make this happen.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, but I think we can do better than that. I'm making a final counteroffer of $1,150,000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1,000,000.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
