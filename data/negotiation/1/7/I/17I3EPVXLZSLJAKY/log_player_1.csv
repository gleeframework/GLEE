{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's valued at $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiations at $1,300,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. This is my maximum budget for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. Can you meet me at this price or is there some flexibility you can offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While I'm open to negotiating, his offer is too low. I'm willing to go lower than my initial price, but I need to make sure I get closer to my target value."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I can't go below $1,200,000. This price still represents a substantial discount from my initial offer and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is my final offer, and I'd like to know if you're willing to accept it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to go a bit further to close this deal.  $1,150,000 is still a bit below where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,175,000?  This price would allow me to move forward while still giving you a great deal on the product.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1175000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, but I think we can do better than that. I'm making a final counteroffer of $1,150,000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.
