"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is better than $1,000,000, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to lower her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  He's starting with a counteroffer of $850,000, which is halfway between Alice's offer of $900,000 and her minimum value of $800,000. This shows he's serious about buying but also wants a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $880,000, which is close to Bob's counteroffer of $850,000.  It's a good deal for Bob, as he's getting the product for $120,000 less than buying from John. Continuing to negotiate might save a little more, but the risk of losing the deal to John isn't worth it at this point."
