Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:** Offering the product at $125 allows for some negotiation wiggle room if Bob tries to haggle. It's a price that's significantly above your minimum ($150) but still potentially attractive to Bob since it's above his perceived value ($100). 
* **Creating a Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning a ""special price,"" you subtly imply this offer might not last, encouraging Bob to consider it more seriously.
* **Backup Plan:**  You're covered if Bob rejects the offer. You have John ready to buy it at your minimum acceptable price."
