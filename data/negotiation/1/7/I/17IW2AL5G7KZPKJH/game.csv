"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd love it. I'm asking for $150 for it, which is a great deal considering its value.  What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This still gives you a great deal on a fantastic product. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's meet in the middle.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's go with $102.50.  That's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal.",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $102.50 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $98.50,  which is closer to my initial offer and hopefully fair for both of us.",98.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go lower than $100. This is a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this.",100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $99. If we can agree on that, we can finalize the deal. ",99.0,Bob,8,
