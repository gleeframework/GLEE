Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant benefits you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, it's always best to aim higher initially. Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000, so there's a potential negotiation space.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a substantial profit above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Alternative Option:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, I can always fall back on John's guaranteed purchase at my desired price."
