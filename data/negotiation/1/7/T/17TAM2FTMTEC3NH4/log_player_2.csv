"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth $9,500. Let me know if this aligns with your expectations or if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and $9,500 is still above his target of $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. It's still within Bob's budget, and it shows that Bob is serious about negotiating a fair deal. This sets the stage for further bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value you place on the product, I propose a price of $9,000. This allows us to meet somewhere in the middle. Please let me know if this is acceptable or if you'd like to continue negotiating. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial one, it's still above Bob's target price of $10,000.  Bob should continue to negotiate for a lower price. There are still rounds remaining, and he can always choose to buy from John if he's not satisfied with the final price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues to push for a lower price but shows a willingness to compromise. Bob is only increasing his offer by $250, demonstrating that he's getting closer to his limit, but still trying to secure a good deal."
