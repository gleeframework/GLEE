Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will yield significant returns for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, considering its potential benefits. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Within Reason:** Offering the product at $1,300,000 sets a strong anchor point, while still being significantly below your minimum acceptable price and slightly above Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for potential negotiation.
* **Emphasizing Value:** The message focuses on the product's ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential benefits"" to entice Bob.
* **Open for Negotiation:** The tone is polite and invites Bob's feedback, suggesting a willingness to discuss the price further.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a price significantly higher than his perceived value. If Bob rejects the initial offer, you can gradually lower the price, knowing you have a guaranteed offer from John at $1,500,000."
