Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. I can offer it to you for $90. It's a great price for a high-quality product like this.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $90, and I'm trying to stay under $80. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation. John offers a guaranteed price that fits my budget."
