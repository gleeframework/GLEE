"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,300,000 to make this worthwhile.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll gain from this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
