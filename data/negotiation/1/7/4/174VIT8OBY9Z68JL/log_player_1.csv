"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a point that is a good compromise between your desired price and Bob's perceived value. It allows for some room to negotiate if needed, while still securing a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000.  That's my absolute maximum, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price. Let's make this happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is a decent sum, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a compromise closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,300,000 to make this worthwhile.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll gain from this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
