"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $1,400,000 is still more than his maximum budget, and he can try to get a better price from Alice or buy from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000.  That's my absolute maximum, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,300,000 to make this worthwhile.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll gain from this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept the offer.  Alice has come down to $1,300,000, which is still within Bob's budget and a good deal. While he could try to get a lower price, it's risky to keep negotiating and there's always the chance of losing the deal altogether.  It's better to secure the product at a price he's comfortable with."
