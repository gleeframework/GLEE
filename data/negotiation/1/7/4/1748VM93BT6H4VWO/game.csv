"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer but $14,000 is way too high for me. This product would be worth $6,000 to me. How about $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but $6,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for countering.  While $10,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  Would you consider $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm not sure I can go any lower than $9,000, but I'm willing to make a small concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,250. This is as low as I can go, so let me know if it's acceptable to you.",9250.0,Alice,7,
