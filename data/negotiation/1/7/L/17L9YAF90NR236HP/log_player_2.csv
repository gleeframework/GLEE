"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth at least $100 to me, and I know you value it at that price as well.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $110.  Let me know if you're interested, otherwise I'll be selling it to someone else for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's message is a classic negotiation tactic. She's trying to create a sense of urgency and make you think you'll miss out if you don't accept her inflated price. You know you can get the product for $100 from John, so there's no reason to pay more."
