Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $20,000.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you can afford to start the negotiation higher. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  This initial offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts immediately, you've maximized your profit. If he rejects it, you can still negotiate down towards $15,000. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Offering a price of $20,000 leaves room for potential counter-offers from Bob, bringing you closer to your desired outcome."
