"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll love it!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $6,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, Alice. While $9,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8500.0,Alice,5,
