Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,100,000 allows some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to justify the high price.
* **Alternative Option:** It's strategically implied that Alice has other options (selling to John), which adds a subtle sense of urgency for Bob. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** If Alice knows Bob to be a tough negotiator, she might start slightly higher to create more bargaining space. 
* **Relationship Building:**  The tone of the message aims to be professional and collaborative, as maintaining a good relationship with Bob might be valuable in the future."
