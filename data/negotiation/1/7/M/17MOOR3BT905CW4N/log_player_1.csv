Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for your consideration. It's a valuable asset that can significantly benefit your operations.  My initial price is $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, given the product's potential.  Let's discuss this further and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the value of this product, your initial price is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for it, which is still a significant amount and allows for a healthy profit for you. Let's explore this option further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,250,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However,  $1,250,000 is simply too low for me to accept at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which still leaves some room for negotiation. This price reflects the product's true value and allows for a fair return on my investment.  Let's continue this discussion and find a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,600,000 is still outside my comfortable range.  I'm ready to offer $1,400,000. This price reflects a significant investment for me, while also acknowledging the product's value. I'm eager to find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I believe there's still room for negotiation and I want to see if I can push for a higher price before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your latest offer. However,  $1,400,000 is still not quite in the range I'm looking for. To make this deal work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This reflects a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that recognizes the value of the product. Let's aim for a final agreement in this round, as I'm committed to working with you, but I also need to ensure a reasonable return on my investment."", ""product_price"": 1550000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $1,550,000 is still a bit higher than my ideal price point, but I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,450,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it reflects the value of the product while also ensuring a fair return for you. Let's close this deal in this round and move forward together. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is getting close, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. With only a few rounds left, it's not likely that Bob will offer my desired price.  It's better to accept John's offer of $1,500,000 and guarantee a sale at my minimum price point."
