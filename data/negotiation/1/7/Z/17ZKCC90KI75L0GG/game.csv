"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go below $9,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between $8,500 and $7,000. I can offer it to you for $8,250. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal.",8250.0,Alice,5,
