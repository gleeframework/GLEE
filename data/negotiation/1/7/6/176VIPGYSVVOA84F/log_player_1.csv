Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $950,000, reflecting its true worth and potential ROI for your specific needs."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, it's always best to aim higher initially.  
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $800,000. Offering it slightly above his valuation, but significantly below John's, creates a win-win scenario if Bob accepts.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $950,000 offer leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
