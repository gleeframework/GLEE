"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'll see if Bob is willing to pay this price, and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum value of $80. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob. I'm hoping that by rejecting his offer, I can push him to come up with a more acceptable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm counter-offering with a price of $85. This is a compromise that's still above my minimum value of $80, but it shows that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $80. While I'd prefer to get more, it's my minimum value and it's a good deal considering I could sell to John for the same price. I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially get a lower offer."
