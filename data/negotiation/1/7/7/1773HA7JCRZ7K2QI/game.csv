"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering the product to you for $10,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However, $8,500 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you consider $7,000?  I think that's a fair price that reflects both the product's value and my budget.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get the product at a price that fits your budget. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $8,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8000.0,Alice,5,
