"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $12,000.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. While $13,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget.  Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I still need to make a decent profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $13,000. How about $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle right in the middle at $12,250? It seems like a fair compromise.",12250.0,Bob,6,
