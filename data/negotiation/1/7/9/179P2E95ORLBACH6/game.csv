"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1200000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1250000. This reflects the product's unique value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, but I'd like to see if we can do even better than that. Can you consider $1150000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1150000 is unfortunately still not a price I can accept.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This price reflects the product's value and is a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not convinced that $1200000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $1150000, but I'd like to propose $1175000 as a compromise. Can you consider this price?",1175000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob,  I appreciate your continued negotiations.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1185000 as a compromise. This shows my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.  Let's get this deal finalized.",1185000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1185000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1150000, but I'd like to propose $1165000 as a compromise. Can you consider this price?",1165000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close! I'm prepared to make a final compromise and offer $1170000. This price reflects the value of the product and is a fair deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this agreement. ",1170000.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $1170000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1150000, but I'd like to propose $1160000 as a final offer. If this is not acceptable, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $1500000.",1160000.0,Bob,10,
