"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I have 10 rounds to negotiate and can potentially get a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, but I'd like to see if we can do even better than that. Can you consider $1150000?

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is coming down in price, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I have 6 rounds left, so there's still time to see if we can get closer to my target price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is unfortunately still not a price I can accept.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, it's still not high enough. I have 4 rounds left, and I'm hopeful that we can reach a more agreeable price."

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $1170000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1150000, but I'd like to propose $1160000 as a final offer. If this is not acceptable, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $1500000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,160,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's final offer is getting close to my target price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  It's risky to reject his offer and try to negotiate further, as he has indicated that he may buy from John instead. It's better to secure the $1,000,000 from John than risk getting nothing at all."
