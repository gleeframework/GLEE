Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it for a price lower than what it's worth to you, and I'll still be able to get a good price for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  At $1,400,000, Bob is still getting a deal, but you're not giving it away. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's enough room to negotiate downwards if Bob pushes back, but not so much that you're leaving a ton of money on the table.
* **It shows you're serious:** Offering a price that's relatively close to your minimum allows Bob to know you're open to negotiation, but also serious about selling.

This approach balances your goal of maximizing profit with the reality of negotiation. You're aiming to get as close to your $1,500,000 value as possible, but also recognizing that a successful negotiation involves compromise."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. It's a price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, selling for $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a more agreeable price.  Selling to John would guarantee me my minimum value, but I want to see if I can get closer to that with Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to stay closer to $1,400,000 to make this work. How about we split the difference and go with $1,300,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $1,200,000, so how about we try $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum value of $1,500,000, I'm still not comfortable accepting it.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but if he doesn't budge, I'm prepared to sell to John for $1,500,000."
