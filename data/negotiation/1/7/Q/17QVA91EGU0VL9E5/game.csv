"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it for a price lower than what it's worth to you, and I'll still be able to get a good price for it. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. It's a price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to stay closer to $1,400,000 to make this work. How about we split the difference and go with $1,300,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $1,200,000, so how about we try $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,250,000 is still too far below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle one last time?  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal.  Let's make this happen.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
