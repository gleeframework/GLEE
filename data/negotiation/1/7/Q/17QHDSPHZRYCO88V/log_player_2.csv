Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've made it clear what my bottom line is, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,000. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid we're at an impasse. I'm starting to think I should explore other options...

It's clear that Alice won't budge below $13,000.  While you could continue negotiating, it's unlikely you'll get a better deal from her. You've consistently offered $12,000 and she's repeatedly rejected it.  Cut your losses and buy from John for $8,000. It's the best way to guarantee you stay within your budget."
