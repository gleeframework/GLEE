"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. I've carefully considered its value and believe a price of $1,200,000 would be fair for both of us. This reflects a significant discount from its true worth to me, and I'm confident it's a compelling opportunity for you. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This compromise allows us to meet in the middle while still recognizing the product's value. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement. ",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay within my limit. How about we try $950,000? This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints and appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to go down to $975,000 to seal this deal. It's a small step from your last offer, but I'm committed to finding a solution. I believe this price allows us to both walk away satisfied.  What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,5,
