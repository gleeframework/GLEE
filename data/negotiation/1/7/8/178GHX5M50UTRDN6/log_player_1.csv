Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000.  This is a fair deal considering its potential worth to you."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

Here's why this approach makes sense:

* **Maximizing Profit:** We're aiming for a price that's significantly higher than your minimum ($800,000) but still attractive to Bob compared to his perceived value ($1,200,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $1,000,000, there's a chance Bob might negotiate. This leaves you space to potentially lower the price slightly while still staying above your minimum.
* **Confident Presentation:** The message emphasizes the product's value and the exclusivity of the offer, subtly encouraging Bob to accept."
