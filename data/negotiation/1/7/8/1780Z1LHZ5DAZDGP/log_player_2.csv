"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob can likely get a better price than $14,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm happy to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At $13,000, Bob is saving $2,000 compared to buying from John. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting the counteroffer and then potentially making a counteroffer higher than $13,000 is present.  Accepting Alice's offer minimizes risk and still provides a good saving."
