"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of significant value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering its potential worth to you. Let me know what you think.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can't justify going above $1,050,000.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your perspective.  While $1,050,000 is a good starting point, I need to be closer to $1,100,000 to make this deal work for me.  This price still leaves you a significant margin for profit, and I'm confident the product will deliver the value you're looking for.  Let's see if we can bridge this small gap.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,075,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
