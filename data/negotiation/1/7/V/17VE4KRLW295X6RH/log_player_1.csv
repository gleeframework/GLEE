Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob.
* **Above Bob's Value, Below Yours:** Offering it at $119 is higher than Bob's perceived value ($100), but still below your minimum ($120).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is $119, starting slightly higher leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at your minimum price."
