"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's something truly special, and I believe it would be a valuable asset for you. I'm starting with a price of $950,000, which reflects its exceptional quality and potential. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget. It's logical to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $950,000 is simply out of my price range.  I'm willing to offer $700,000 for it, which reflects its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me. It's a valuable product, and I'm confident it holds greater worth. How about we compromise at $850,000? It's a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let's work together to find a solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $850,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $750,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's work together to bridge this gap."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference and aim for $800,000. This price would allow both of us to walk away feeling satisfied.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.
