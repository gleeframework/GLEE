"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's something truly special, and I believe it would be a valuable asset for you. I'm starting with a price of $950,000, which reflects its exceptional quality and potential. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $950,000 is simply out of my price range.  I'm willing to offer $700,000 for it, which reflects its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me. It's a valuable product, and I'm confident it holds greater worth. How about we compromise at $850,000? It's a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let's work together to find a solution.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $850,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $750,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's work together to bridge this gap.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I hear you, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference and aim for $800,000. This price would allow both of us to walk away feeling satisfied.  What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
