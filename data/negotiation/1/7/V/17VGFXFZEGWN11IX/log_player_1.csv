Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $130. This gives me a good starting point, and hopefully Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a bit more than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $110 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll try to get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm offering $125. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still a good price for me, and hopefully Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not willing to meet my minimum acceptable price. While $115 is better than nothing, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. I'm going to sell the product to John for $120, which is my minimum acceptable price."
