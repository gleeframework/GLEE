Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $75 is getting a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise again. How about we meet at $85? It's still a great price for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:

While I could try to haggle Alice down further, $85 is within my budget and a reasonable compromise. It's better to accept a decent deal now than risk the negotiation falling apart and having to settle for John's offer."
