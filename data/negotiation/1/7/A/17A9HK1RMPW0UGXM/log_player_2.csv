"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm confident this product is a game-changer for you, and I'm offering it to you at a price that reflects its value. I'm asking for $1,000,000. It's a fair price, considering the product's worth to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's closer to your maximum value than to Alice's minimum value, giving her more room to negotiate.
* **There's potential for a better deal.**  By rejecting, you can start a counter-offer process and hopefully secure a price closer to your target.

**Next Steps:**

You should make a counteroffer in the next round.  Since you're aiming to save as much as possible, a counteroffer closer to $800,000 (Alice's value) would be ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which still represents a significant profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $950,000? This is a substantial investment for you, and I'm confident it will pay off handsomely. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high.**  While she's come down from her initial offer, $950,000 is still far from your ideal price point. 
* **Further negotiation is possible.**  You've already shown a willingness to compromise, and Alice has demonstrated flexibility. There's still room to reach a mutually agreeable price.

**Next Steps:**

You should continue to counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to your target while leaving some room for compromise. A counteroffer around $925,000 might be a good starting point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm confident we can find a middle ground. I'm prepared to offer $925,000 for the product.  This price represents a significant return for you while still allowing me to make a sound investment. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 925000}
