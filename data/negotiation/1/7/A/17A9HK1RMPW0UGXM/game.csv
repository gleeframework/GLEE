"Bob, I'm confident this product is a game-changer for you, and I'm offering it to you at a price that reflects its value. I'm asking for $1,000,000. It's a fair price, considering the product's worth to you. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which still represents a significant profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $950,000? This is a substantial investment for you, and I'm confident it will pay off handsomely. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm confident we can find a middle ground. I'm prepared to offer $925,000 for the product.  This price represents a significant return for you while still allowing me to make a sound investment. Let's make this deal happen.",925000.0,Bob,4,
