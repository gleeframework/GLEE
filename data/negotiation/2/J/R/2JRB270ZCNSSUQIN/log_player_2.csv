Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $107.50 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to go down to $115 as a final offer.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you say?

It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Alice has indicated $115 is her best offer, and that's still more than you want to spend.  You can get the product for $100 from John, so it makes sense to go with that option and save some money."
