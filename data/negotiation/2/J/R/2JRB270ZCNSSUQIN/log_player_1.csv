"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really appreciate it! I'm offering it to you for $175, which is a great deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price above my minimum but still below what John would pay. This allows for some room for negotiation and shows I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price and significantly less than what John is offering. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested but $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130,  which is still a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but I need to stick to my budget. How about $95? I'm hoping we can make a deal work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While it's closer to my minimum, it's still significantly less than what John is offering. I'll reject and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $95 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $120. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $107.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $107.5 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price. I have 4 rounds left and John is ready to buy for $150, so I'm going to try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $107.50 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to go down to $115 as a final offer.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
