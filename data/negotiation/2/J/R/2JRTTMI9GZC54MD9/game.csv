"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me, and it allows us both to make a worthwhile deal.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $11,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and settle on $10,500.  This allows us to both walk away feeling good about the deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10,500. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $10,750. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10750.0,Alice,5,
