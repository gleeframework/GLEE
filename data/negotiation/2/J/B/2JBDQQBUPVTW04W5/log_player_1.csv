Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $12,000.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is only worth $10,000 to Bob.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 from John.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum acceptable price, you have leverage.  You should aim high with Bob, knowing you have a fallback option. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its unique value, I'm setting the price at $13,500. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have significant interest from other potential buyers."",
""product_price"": 13500
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You're not starting at Bob's valuation.
* **Sense of Scarcity:**  You create a sense of urgency and competition.
* **Justification:** You vaguely mention the product's ""unique value"" without overselling it.

**Possible Outcomes**

* **Bob Accepts:**  You make a profit of $1,500 above your minimum.
* **Bob Negotiates:**  He might counter-offer. You have room to negotiate down slightly, but don't go below $12,500.
* **Bob Rejects:** You move on to John and sell at your guaranteed price. 

**Important:** Remember, this is a single-round negotiation.  Be confident in your offer!"
