"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $10000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9250.  This is still a great deal for a product of this quality. Let's try to find a middle ground.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position.  However, $9250 is still a little higher than I'm able to go right now.  I'm willing to offer $8750, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not quite there yet.  How about we meet in the middle at $9000?  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $8800, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not going to see eye to eye on this price. Let's try one last compromise: $8900.  This is a very reasonable price for a product of this quality, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile.  Let me know your final decision.",8900.0,Alice,7,
