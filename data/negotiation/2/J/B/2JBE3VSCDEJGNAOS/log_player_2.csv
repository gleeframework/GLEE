"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $10,000 is above his budget, and he can likely get a better deal by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $10,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9250.  This is still a great deal for a product of this quality. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $9,250 is closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He has several rounds left, and he has the option of buying from John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position.  However, $9,250 is still a little higher than I'm able to go right now.  I'm willing to offer $8,750, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still not quite there yet.  How about we meet in the middle at $9000?  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Although $9,000 is closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He has several rounds left, and he has the option of buying from John for $8,000.  He can likely get closer to his ideal price with further negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $8,800, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not going to see eye to eye on this price. Let's try one last compromise: $8900.  This is a very reasonable price for a product of this quality, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile.  Let me know your final decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While it's still a bit more than he'd like to pay, it's a reasonable price for a quality product, and it's closer to his budget than buying from John. With only three rounds left, there's no guarantee he can negotiate a lower price, and he risks losing out on the product altogether."
