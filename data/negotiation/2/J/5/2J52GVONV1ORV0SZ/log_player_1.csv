Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to my value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $800,000, so I need to offer a price that's appealing but still profitable for me.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Backup Option:** I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, giving me leverage.

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob at a premium price while acknowledging that I have a strong alternative if he declines."
