"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more,  I'm offering you the product for $8,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value to me. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still hoping to meet closer to my budget. How about $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $7,500 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'll offer you the product for $8,000. This is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested.",8000.0,Alice,5,
