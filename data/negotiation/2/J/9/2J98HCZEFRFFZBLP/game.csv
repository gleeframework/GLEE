,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15000. How about we meet in the middle at $18000? I think that's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $18000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $16000 for the product. Would you be willing to consider this price?",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $17000? I think that's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $17000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $15500 for the product. This is my final offer, so I hope we can meet in the middle here.",15500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15500. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $16500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",16500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $16500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $15500 and $16500, which is $16000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",16000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to come to an agreement, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $16250. This is my absolute final offer, and I hope we can make a deal.",16250.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your efforts, Alice, but I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I'm willing to meet you at $16000, which is the price I've been offering since round 4. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $12000. This is my final offer.",16000.0,Bob,10,
