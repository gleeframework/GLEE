Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $110?  It's a fair price for both of us.

You have three options:

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $110, and it's better to secure the product for $100 from John than risk the negotiation going nowhere."
