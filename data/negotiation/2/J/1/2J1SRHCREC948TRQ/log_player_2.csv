"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $15000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. Therefore, it makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm happy to consider purchasing if we can come closer to $12,000.  Would you be open to discussing a price around that point?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget concerns, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and try $13500?  This would still give me a reasonable return on my investment, while also giving you a good value on the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still above Bob's preferred price point of $12,000. While it's closer to Bob's budget, there's still room for negotiation. Bob is better off rejecting the offer and trying to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm very interested in this product, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $12,500? This would allow me to purchase the product while also giving you a fair price."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I see we're getting closer. While $12500 is tempting, I need a bit more to make this work. How about we split the difference again and settle on $13000? This would give you a great deal on a valuable product, and it would also allow me to make a fair profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is closer to Bob's preferred price point, he is still aiming to save as much as possible. There is still potential for negotiation, and the threat of purchasing from John for $12,000 gives Bob leverage.  Bob should continue to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. While I understand you need a certain price, I'm still not quite comfortable with $13,000. How about we meet in the middle at $12,750?  This would be a good compromise for both of us, and it would allow me to secure this product within my budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12750}
