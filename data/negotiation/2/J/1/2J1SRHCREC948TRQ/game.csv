"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $15000.  What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $15000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm happy to consider purchasing if we can come closer to $12000.  Would you be open to discussing a price around that point?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and try $13500?  This would still give me a reasonable return on my investment, while also giving you a good value on the product. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm very interested in this product, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $12500? This would allow me to purchase the product while also giving you a fair price.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I see we're getting closer. While $12500 is tempting, I need a bit more to make this work. How about we split the difference again and settle on $13000? This would give you a great deal on a valuable product, and it would also allow me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. While I understand you need a certain price, I'm still not quite comfortable with $13000. How about we meet in the middle at $12750?  This would be a good compromise for both of us, and it would allow me to secure this product within my budget.  What do you think?",12750.0,Bob,6,
