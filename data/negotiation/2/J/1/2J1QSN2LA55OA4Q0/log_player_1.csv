"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000.  This is a bold opening, but it gives me room to negotiate down if needed.  I don't know Bob's perceived value of the product, so I'm taking a chance that he might be willing to pay a premium.  It also allows me to quickly see if he's serious about buying."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $800,000 is my minimum, I'm not going to settle for that right away. I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to send a counteroffer and see how much negotiation room there is."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still a good profit margin. Hopefully, Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to accept and close the deal, I want to try to get closer to my minimum.  I'm not confident he'll go higher, but I need to try.  I still have a few rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $850,000. This is a compromise, but it's still above my minimum. I hope Bob is willing to bridge the gap and we can finally reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is getting frustrating! I'm not confident that Bob is going to come up to my minimum. It's getting late in the game, and I'm running out of time. It's better to take the guaranteed $800,000 from John than to risk getting stuck with a lower price."
