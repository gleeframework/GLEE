"Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a good price, it's still a significant amount of money. Bob should try to negotiate a lower price. It's possible Alice is willing to go lower, and Bob can save even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $150,000. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal.  It's a bold move, but it's also a calculated one. Bob has a backup option with John, so there's less risk in pushing for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $775,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, but still leaves room for negotiation. Bob should continue to try and get a lower price, as he still has the option of buying from John for $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $750,000. This shows Alice that he is serious about buying the product but is still looking for a good deal. It's a compromise, but it's still within Bob's budget and leaves room for a potential final deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $765,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $765,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $765,000 is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $750,000.  It's likely that further negotiation will be very difficult, and there's a good chance that Alice won't budge further.  At this point, it's better for Bob to accept the offer and avoid the risk of Alice rejecting his next counteroffer or the negotiation dragging on further. This deal also saves Bob a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
