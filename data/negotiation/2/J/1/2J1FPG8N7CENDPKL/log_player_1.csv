Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making this your lowest acceptable price (reservation price).
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):** There's a potential negotiation space between $1,000,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, so aiming closer to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation is ideal. However, being too aggressive could make Bob reject the offer. 

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will significantly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Confident Tone:** Shows you value Bob as a buyer.
* **Highlighting Value:** ""Exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value proposition"" emphasize the product's worth.
* **Strong Opening Price:** $1,400,000 leaves room for negotiation but still secures a significant profit.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might slightly lower the initial price to provide more negotiation space.
* **Relationship Value:**  If a long-term relationship with Bob is important, a slightly less aggressive offer could be beneficial. 

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and be ready to negotiate to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
