"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $150 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize potential profit.
* **Positive Message:** I'm framing the offer in a positive light, highlighting the product's value and encouraging Bob's interest. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message leaves room for negotiation, showing I'm flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal is to maximize profit:** While $120 is better than $100 (John's offer), I still believe there's room for a better deal with Bob.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** Bob's counteroffer shows interest.  Rejecting it keeps the negotiation open and allows me to try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest! While $120 is closer, I'd need to be at $135 to make this work for me.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my original offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Positive and Encouraging:** The message stays positive and encourages Bob to continue the negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** I'm still leaving some room for negotiation, hoping to land on a price closer to $140 or $145."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $135 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my desired price:** $125 is close to my desired price range and still higher than John's offer.  
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for a better deal with Bob, especially since he's shown continued interest. 
* **Keeping the negotiation open:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation going and maintain leverage to potentially push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I really appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $125 is tempting, I'd need to be at $130 to make it work for me. I'm confident this product will be worth it to you, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** I'm lowering my offer to $130, which is closer to Bob's counteroffer of $125. This shows that I'm serious about reaching a deal.
* **Highlighting value:** I reiterate the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider a higher price.
* **Focusing on mutual benefit:** I emphasize that a deal would benefit both of us, encouraging Bob to see it as a fair outcome.
* **Maintaining a firm stance:**  I'm still holding out for a price above $125, as I believe the product is worth more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $130 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125 again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited time:** We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation, and I need to consider the potential of selling to John. 
* **No significant gains:** Bob is insistent on $125, and there's a good chance that my counteroffer will be rejected again. There's little to gain by continuing the negotiation.
* **Profit over principle:**  $125 is still significantly higher than John's offer, and securing a sale is better than risking missing out entirely."
