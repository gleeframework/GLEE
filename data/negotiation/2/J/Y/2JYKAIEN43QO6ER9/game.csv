"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1200000.  It's a premium item worth a great deal to me, but I believe this price reflects its value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $800000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $800000 simply doesn't reflect the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This price allows for a mutually beneficial agreement and ensures that I can meet my minimum needs. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1000000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900000. This price should be more acceptable to you, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're still looking for a lower price, but $900000 doesn't quite cover my costs. I'm willing to go down to $950000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my need to make a reasonable profit.  Let's try to reach an agreement in this round.",950000.0,Alice,5,
