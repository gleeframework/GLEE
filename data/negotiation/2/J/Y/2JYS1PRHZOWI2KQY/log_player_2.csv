"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I will reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $8,000 to her, so she has some room for negotiation. I'll wait for a better offer.
