"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! Based on its value, I'm asking for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. Can you meet me at that price?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This price reflects the product's value and gives us both a fair deal. Let's make this happen!",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $13,500? That's the lowest I can go.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to stay above $15,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $15,500? This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product. Let's try to close this deal.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $14,500. That's the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",14500.0,Bob,6,
