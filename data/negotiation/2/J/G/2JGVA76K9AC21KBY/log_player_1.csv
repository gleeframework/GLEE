Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $800,000, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'm confident that the product is valuable enough to warrant this price, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium for it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value.  While I'd prefer to avoid selling to John, I need to get a price closer to my minimum. I will counteroffer Bob and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial price. It's still above my minimum value, but I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  While I would prefer to get more, it's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the sale to John. I will accept Bob's offer."
