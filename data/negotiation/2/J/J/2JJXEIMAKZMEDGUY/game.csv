"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1150000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and a significant profit for me.  Let me know what you think.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a significant profit, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1050000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $1100000 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $1125000?  This still gives you a substantial profit, and it's a fair price for the value of the product.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1090000. This is the highest I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1090000.0,Bob,4,
