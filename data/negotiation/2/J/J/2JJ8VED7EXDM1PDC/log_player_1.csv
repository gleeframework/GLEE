Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm aiming for a higher price than $900,000, as the product is worth much more to Bob. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
