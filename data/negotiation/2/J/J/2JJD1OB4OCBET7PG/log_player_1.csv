{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. This is a great deal for you, and it's a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm offering a price slightly below my minimum, but still above Bob's estimated value. This gives me room to negotiate if he counters, and it shows that I'm open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $12,000 for the product. That's my maximum budget. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't settle for a price that undervalues my product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $12,500?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 12500}
