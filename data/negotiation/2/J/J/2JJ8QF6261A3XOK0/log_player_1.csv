This offer is slightly above Bob's value of $10,000, leaving room for negotiation. It's also below my minimum value of $12,000, allowing for some potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I can only afford to pay $11,000 at this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I still want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm still looking for a price closer to $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product. Could we possibly meet somewhere in between? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is not willing to go higher than $11,000, and I'm not willing to go lower than $11,250.  I'm not confident we can reach an agreement.  Instead of continuing to negotiate, I'll sell the product to John for $12,000."
