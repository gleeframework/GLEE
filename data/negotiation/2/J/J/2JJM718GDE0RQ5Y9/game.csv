"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, though. How about $9000? That's a significant discount and a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $9000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a compromise. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13000. This is a bit higher than your offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10500. This is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12000.
