"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob,  $10,000 is a bit too low for me. While I'm open to negotiation, I need to get closer to my asking price.  Let's try $15,000, which is still less than what the product is worth to you. What do you say?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While I understand it's worth $15,000 to you, I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,4,
