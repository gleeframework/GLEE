"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm excited to discuss the details with you. I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $700,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $825,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering its value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $750,000. Would you be willing to come down a bit more?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a better price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think $825,000 is as low as I can go. I'm willing to meet you at $775,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",775000.0,Alice,5,
