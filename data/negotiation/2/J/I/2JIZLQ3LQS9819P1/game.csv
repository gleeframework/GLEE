"I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This reflects the true value of the product, and it's a price I'm confident we can both agree on.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,600,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. Can we discuss further?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
