{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. We're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,700. I have a few rounds left, and I believe I can push for a higher price.  I'm not desperate to sell, and John is a solid backup option if things don't work out with Bob."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and while I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, $10,750 is a decent amount. It's more than what John is offering, and it's likely the best I can get from Bob at this point."
