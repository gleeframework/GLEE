"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for a lower price than $12,000. Since you're aiming to save as much money as possible, rejecting the offer and trying to negotiate a lower price makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for potential negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,000 is still a better deal than buying from John for $15,000. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer and you'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price. It's better to secure the product at a price you're comfortable with rather than risk losing the deal altogether."
