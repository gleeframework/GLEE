Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $9,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 
This offer aims to maximize profit while staying attractive to Bob:

* **High but Reasonable:** $9,500 is significantly below Bob's perceived value ($10,000), giving him a good deal while securing a large profit for Alice.
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:**  While a strong opening offer, it doesn't start at Bob's absolute maximum, allowing for potential counter-offers if Bob tries to negotiate.
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing John guarantees $8,000 provides Alice with a strong fallback position, making her less likely to accept a lowball offer from Bob."
