"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate.  This gives me some room to maneuver if he counteroffers.  However, I'm also mindful of the time constraint and the possibility of selling to John for $15,000 if things don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm happy with $15,000, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll keep the option of selling to John in mind, but I want to explore all options with Bob before going that route."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway, offering $18,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a higher price than John's offer.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable price and be willing to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has moved closer to my initial asking price, and I'm starting to run out of time.  Accepting his offer of $16,000 is a good deal, especially considering I can always sell to John for $15,000.  This allows me to secure a sale while still getting a bit more than John's offer."
