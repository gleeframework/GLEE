"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay full price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer

Alice's offer is too high. You can get the product for $800,000 from John, which is significantly less than Alice's $950,000 offer."
