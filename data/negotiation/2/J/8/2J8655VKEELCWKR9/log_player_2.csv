"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible.  While $120 is a good deal, you can likely get it for less.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $100 to Alice, I'm offering a price that's slightly above her value. This shows I'm serious about buying but still want a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is still cheaper than John's price, I'm confident I can negotiate further.  Alice has already shown a willingness to lower her price, so I'll continue to see if I can get it down even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing that I'm willing to compromise. However, I'm still keeping it below Alice's offer to push for a better deal. This strategy aims to find a middle ground where both of us are satisfied."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is tempting, I'm still determined to save more.  Alice's offer is getting closer to John's price, but I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, showing a willingness to meet halfway.  I'm hoping Alice will accept this offer, as it's a fair price for both of us.  If she rejects, I'm prepared to consider buying from John in the next round if the price doesn't become more appealing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now only $5 lower than John's price.  While I'd still prefer a lower price, the risk of further negotiation is too high.  There are only three rounds left, and it's likely that Alice will continue to increase her price. Buying from John now ensures I get the product within my budget, even if it's not the absolute best deal."
