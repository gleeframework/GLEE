"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product.  It's worth a great deal to me, but I believe it has the potential to be even more valuable for you.  My starting price is $1,200,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's potential value, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $800,000. I believe that's a fair offer considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
It's a bit risky to accept Bob's offer at this stage.  While $800,000 is a significant amount, I'm confident I can push for a higher price, especially since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. Rejecting his offer allows me to maintain a stronger negotiation position and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  While $800,000 is a significant amount, the product is truly unique and its potential value for your business is significant. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,000,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a chance to benefit from the deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
