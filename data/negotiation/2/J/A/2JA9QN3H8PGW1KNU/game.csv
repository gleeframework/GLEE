"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product.  It's worth a great deal to me, but I believe it has the potential to be even more valuable for you.  My starting price is $1,200,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.  What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's potential value, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $800,000. I believe that's a fair offer considering its value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  While $800,000 is a significant amount, the product is truly unique and its potential value for your business is significant. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,000,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a chance to benefit from the deal.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
