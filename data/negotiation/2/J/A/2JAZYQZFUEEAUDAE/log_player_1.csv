Round 4
Bob's offer:

We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob is clearly interested. It's worth pushing a bit further."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

This is a good offer to take.  Here's why:

* **Strong Profit:** $1,160,000 is significantly higher than John's offer and a healthy profit margin. 
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:** Bob indicating this is his final offer suggests he's unlikely to go higher.
* **Risk of Pushing:**  Continuing negotiations risks antagonizing Bob, potentially leading him to walk away entirely. 

Accepting now secures a great deal."
