"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let's make this happen! "", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  My message is positive and emphasizes the value Bob would receive. This helps build a rapport.
* **Room for Compromise:**  The initial price is high enough that I can potentially reduce it if necessary to close the deal.
* **Strategic Backstop:**  Knowing I have John as a backup buyer for $1,500,000 gives me a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that initial offer is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but it needs to be priced much lower to make sense for me. How about we start at $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is necessary:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Sell to John is not the best option yet:**  I'm not ready to sell to John for $1,500,000 because I might be able to get a higher price from Bob through negotiation. 

**Next Round:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is far too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000 to show you I'm serious about making a deal. This price still gives you a great value, and we can finalize this quickly. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm counteroffering with a price that is still higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, showing flexibility.
* **Value Proposition:** I reiterate the value proposition to Bob, emphasizing the great value he'll receive at this price.
* **Urgency:** I mention the ability to finalize the deal quickly to encourage a swift agreement.
* **Strategic Position:**  While $1,300,000 is still above my minimum, it leaves room for further negotiation if needed.  

I'm staying optimistic about reaching a deal with Bob, but I'm prepared to sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for moving closer to a reasonable price.  However, $1,300,000 is still too high for me. Let's try $950,000. This offer reflects my serious interest while acknowledging the need for a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $950,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation continues:** I'm not ready to give up yet. I believe there's still room for a more favorable price. 
* **Sell to John is still not the best option:** I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob. However, I'm increasingly aware of the risk of running out of rounds.

**Next Round:** I will counter Bob's offer again, trying to inch closer to a mutually agreeable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and drop the price to $1,125,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to close this deal without further delay. Let's make it happen!"", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that is exactly halfway between my previous offer ($1,300,000) and Bob's current offer ($950,000). This shows a genuine commitment to compromise. 
* **Urgency:**  I emphasize the importance of closing the deal without further delay, hoping to pressure Bob into accepting. 
* **Strategic Calculation:**  $1,125,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price but closer to my desired outcome. I'm running out of rounds, so I need to be more aggressive while still being reasonable.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive and encouraging tone to maintain a good rapport. 

This is a critical round. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John to avoid losing out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm getting closer to a price point where I'm comfortable. How about we settle at $1,000,000 even?  That's my final offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob is getting closer, $1,000,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Time is running out:** I only have 4 rounds left. However, I'm still hopeful that I can get a better deal with Bob. 
* **Selling to John is a last resort:** If I reject Bob's offer, I'm getting dangerously close to having to sell to John, which I'm only willing to do as a last resort.

**Next Round:**  I will counter Bob's offer, hoping to find a compromise closer to my minimum price. I'll need to be more aggressive, but still maintain a positive tone to keep the negotiation going."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're at your limit, and I appreciate your honesty.  I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000 as a final compromise.

* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive tone to keep the conversation constructive and friendly.

I'm taking a big risk by dropping the price this much, but I believe it's a calculated risk. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John. However, I'm still hopeful that we can reach a deal that works for both of us."
