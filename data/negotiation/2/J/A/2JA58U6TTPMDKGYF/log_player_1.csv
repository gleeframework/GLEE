Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  At $110, Bob is still getting a deal compared to his perceived value of $80, making him more likely to consider it.
* **It's below your minimum:** This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers.
* **It's close to your fallback option:** If Bob rejects, you can sell to John for $120, but this offer gives you the opportunity to potentially make a higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to find the product at a lower price. Would you consider selling it for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $95 is better than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still below your minimum acceptable price.  You have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay $120, so it's worth pushing for a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 102.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand your position, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my initial budget. Would you be willing to sell the product for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer is close enough to your minimum acceptable price and a lot closer to your fallback option with John.  Accepting his offer secures a sale and avoids potentially further rounds of negotiations."
