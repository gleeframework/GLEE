"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a unique item that I'm confident you'll find highly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this product. While I recognize its value, $900,000 is a bit steep for me at the moment. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects both our interests. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get closer to the $1,000,000 value you place on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000. This is the best I can do, but I'm confident it's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from owning this product.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your desire to get closer to the $1,000,000 value, but $925,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a good compromise and represents a significant savings for me. This is a fair offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my desired price. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, which is the same price I initially offered. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the value you'll get from owning this product. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",900000.0,Alice,5,
