"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be extremely valuable to your business. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm confident it will significantly benefit your operations.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000,  a price that allows you a substantial return on investment.  This is a limited-time opportunity, as I have another interested party ready to purchase at a lower price. Let's discuss further and see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
