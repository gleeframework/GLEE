"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in your product, $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $950,000 is closer, but still a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $920,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the time we've already spent discussing it.",920000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I have other options for purchasing a similar product.  To make this work, I can't go any higher than $900,000.  This is my final offer.",900000.0,Bob,6,
