"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  

Here's why I'm doing this:

* **Test the waters:** This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and understand his perceived value of the product. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:** It gives me a buffer to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Create urgency:**  By starting high, I create a sense that the price might not go lower, encouraging Bob to act quickly.

I'll analyze Bob's response to this offer and adjust my strategy accordingly for the following rounds."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not ideal. I want to see if I can push for a higher price. 

**Here's my reasoning:**

* **Opportunity to improve:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob clearly sees value in the product, and I'm confident I can get closer to my initial offer.
* **Avoid settling too early:**  Accepting $1,400,000 now risks missing out on a better deal.
* **Maintain leverage:** By rejecting this offer, I keep the negotiation going and maintain control of the process.

I'll analyze Bob's motivations behind this offer and craft a counteroffer accordingly."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

My counteroffer of $1,600,000 represents a compromise:

* **Meeting halfway:** It's a significant reduction from my initial offer of $1,800,000, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still above my minimum:** This price is still $400,000 above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring a profitable sale.
* **Maintaining pressure:** This counteroffer keeps the pressure on Bob to reach a deal, as it's higher than his previous offer.

I believe this counteroffer positions me well to reach a favorable outcome in the next few rounds. I'll carefully observe Bob's response and adjust my strategy as needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is a good deal for me. Here's why I'm accepting:

* **Close to my target:** This price is just $300,000 below my initial offer and a significant profit over my minimum.
* **Limited time:** With 6 rounds remaining, the risk of further negotiation is high. It's unlikely I'll get a much better offer.
* **Avoiding a stalemate:**  Rejecting this offer might lead to a back-and-forth negotiation that could ultimately result in a lower price or a failed deal.

It's important to balance the potential for a higher price with the risks associated with continuing the negotiation. In this case, accepting Bob's offer ensures a successful sale and a profitable outcome."
