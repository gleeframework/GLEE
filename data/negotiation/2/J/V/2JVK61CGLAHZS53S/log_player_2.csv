"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product for sale. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $180 to start. What do you think?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit steep for me.  How about $70?"", ""product_price"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is too low for me.  This product is worth a lot more! How about we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $90. This product is truly worth it. How about we compromise at $110? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is unlikely to go below $100, and her ""final offer"" suggests she's getting firm. It's not worth the risk of her sticking to that price when John offers a guaranteed $100 option."
