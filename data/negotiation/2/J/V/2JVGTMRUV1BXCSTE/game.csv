"Alice, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $14,000 for it. Can we discuss further?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $10,000. Would you be willing to go down to $12,000? This would allow for a fair profit for you and a good deal for me.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I still need to make a decent profit on this sale. I'm willing to go down to $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think about other interested buyers, so let's see if we can meet in the middle.",13000.0,Alice,5,
