(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

It's always best to start by seeing if you can get a lower price. We have 10 rounds, so there's time to negotiate."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down slightly to $12500 to facilitate a deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has come down a bit, but it's still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go a little higher than my original offer, but I'm not going to pay $12,500 yet.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle."
