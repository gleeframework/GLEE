``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum value, but not so high that it's immediately unreasonable to Bob. It leaves room for negotiation, which is important to potentially get a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. It's significantly below my minimum value and leaves very little room for negotiation. It's better to reject and try to counteroffer, or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $1,550,000? This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I see the value in the product,  $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,325,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I need to get closer to $1,500,000.  I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,325,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the opportunity it offers."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your flexibility. To be honest,  $1,450,000 is pushing it a bit for my budget.  Would you consider $1,350,000? I think that's a fair offer, and it would allow me to close this deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue to negotiate, it seems he's unwilling to meet me halfway.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me my minimum value and avoids further negotiation."
