"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $1,550,000? This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I see the value in the product,  $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,325,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the opportunity it offers.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your flexibility. To be honest,  $1,450,000 is pushing it a bit for my budget.  Would you consider $1,350,000? I think that's a fair offer, and it would allow me to close this deal today.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
