Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly beneficial for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,200,000 sets a strong floor.  Alice wants to get as close to that as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still keeping Alice well above Bob's perceived value of $800,000.
* **Confident Presentation:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob without revealing Alice's minimum acceptable price. This encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation."
