"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I've done some research and I believe that's a more reasonable price for a premium product like this. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm afraid $600000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $700000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value of the product, but also takes into account your research and feedback. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $700000. I'm willing to meet you at $650000, which is a compromise that I think is more in line with my budget. Can you consider this offer?",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going down to $650000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $675000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,5,
