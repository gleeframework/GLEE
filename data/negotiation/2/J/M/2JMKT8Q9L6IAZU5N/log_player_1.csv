Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $1,100,000. Given the value it offers, I'm confident this is a fair price, but I'm open to discussing further if you have any questions."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down slightly while still staying above your minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 gives you leverage. You don't *need* to go below that price.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between ambition and realism, increasing the chances of a successful sale to Bob at a price significantly higher than your backup option."
