Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be a great fit for you. It's worth at least $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a special price of $12,000.  This is a great deal for you, as you mentioned it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think! "", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **The offer is $12,000:**  This is a good starting point as it is a significant discount for Bob, while still allowing me to make a profit of $2,000. 
* **The message is friendly and emphasizes value:**  It highlights the value to Bob and gives him a reason to consider the offer.
* **It acknowledges Bob's valuation:** This shows I've listened to his perspective, making him more likely to engage.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a sale with Bob. If he rejects, I have John as a backup, ensuring I don't lose money."
