"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for less than $10,000 from Alice, as it's worth $8,000 to her. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also reflects the fact that you're aware of Alice's lower value for the product, making it more likely for her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is a good deal for you. It's lower than your initial counteroffer and still saves you $2,500 compared to buying from John.  It's likely that further negotiation will result in a price closer to $9,000, but it's not worth the risk of potentially losing the deal entirely."
