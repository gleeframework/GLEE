Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $80 to me, I'll offer it to him at a price slightly higher than that. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 85}

Let's see what Bob has to say!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob's offer of $75 is lower than my minimum price of $80, so I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round. I'll make a counteroffer that's higher than $75 but still lower than my minimum price. Here's my counteroffer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 82}

Let's see if Bob will accept or reject my counteroffer!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than Bob's original offer. Here's my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": 78}

Let's see if Bob will accept or reject this offer!"
