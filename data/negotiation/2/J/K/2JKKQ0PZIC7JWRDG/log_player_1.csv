Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I don't know Bob's valuation, so this allows for some potential profit if he is willing to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $17,000 is better than my minimum, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try for a higher price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}
```

I'm going to counter with $19,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my ideal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $18,000 is close to my initial goal and significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.  While I could try for more, there's always a risk that he'll reject my counteroffer and I'll end up with the lower price from John.  It's better to accept this offer and secure a good profit."
