Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $12,000. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value"" helps justify the high initial price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""What are your thoughts?"" invites Bob to counter-offer, indicating you're willing to negotiate.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy aims to maximize profit but risks Bob rejecting the offer outright. 
* Gauge Bob's interest and adjust your approach accordingly during the negotiation. 
* Keep in mind you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 with John."
