{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget.  It's always better to try and negotiate with Alice first. You can potentially get a much better price, even if it takes several rounds of counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, aiming for a price that's more in line with my budget. This aggressive counteroffer might make Alice think twice and potentially open the door for a more balanced negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's new offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my maximum budget. I'll continue to negotiate and see if I can get a better price from Alice. There's still room to bargain and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $900,000.  This is still lower than Alice's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this will be close enough to her acceptable price that she'll accept it. It's a more reasonable price than my previous offer while still leaving some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer is still above my ideal price, but it's getting closer.  I'm going to make one more counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap.  If Alice doesn't accept my next offer, I'm ready to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final counteroffer. It's my maximum budget, and if Alice doesn't accept, I'll go with John's offer.  I'm hoping Alice will realize that this is a fair price and close the deal.  There's a good chance she'll accept, considering she has been reducing her price and my counteroffers have been approaching her offers."
