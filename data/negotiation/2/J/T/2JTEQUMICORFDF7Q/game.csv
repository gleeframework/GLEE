"I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I believe it's worth a significant investment. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $1100000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you have a budget in mind, but I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1000000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1000000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $950000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at $950000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're willing to go up to $950000, but I'm still not convinced that's enough to cover the product's value. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. Let's try to meet in the middle again, but this time, I'll give you a bit more room to negotiate. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I've made a serious offer of $950000, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm starting to think that buying from John for $800000 might be the better option for me. Can you meet me at $950000 or not?",950000.0,Bob,6,
