"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? This is a fair price that would allow us both to walk away happy. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  It's a fair price that gives us both something to gain. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway on this. How about we settle on $10,750? This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's the best way to close this deal. What do you say?",10750.0,Alice,5,
