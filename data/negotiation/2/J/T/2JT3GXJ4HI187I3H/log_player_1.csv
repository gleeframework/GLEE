Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll really love. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good strategy to start with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $120, we are ""anchoring"" the negotiation at a higher point.  Even if Bob rejects this initial price, it might make a counteroffer closer to $120 seem more reasonable to him.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $120 offer leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, starting the negotiation process. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still keeping the offer attractive enough for Bob to engage in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to our minimum acceptable price, we still have room to negotiate. Bob's counteroffer indicates he's interested but trying to get a better deal. Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation alive, and we can try to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $105?"", 
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counter-offer moves closer to Bob's price while still staying significantly above our minimum. It shows a willingness to negotiate and aims to find a compromise.
* **Maintaining Value:** We don't want to drop the price too drastically, as it could undervalue the product in Bob's eyes. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counter-offer keeps us above the midpoint between the original offer and Bob's counteroffer, giving us room to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I would like to propose a price of $95 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has moved closer to our price, and $95 is a reasonable profit above our minimum of $80. While we could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob might walk away. Accepting this offer secures a solid profit and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
