"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price that is significantly lower than my minimum but still above Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest.
* **Message:**  I'm keeping the message positive and friendly to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

I'm aiming to strike a balance between maximizing my earnings and getting a deal done quickly.  We'll see how Bob responds and adjust accordingly in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it to me for $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:**  While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Moving to Round 3:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my desired price point.
* **Selling to John:** At this point, selling to John for $15,000 is the most attractive option. However, I'm willing to explore further negotiations with Bob before making a final decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $10,500. This is still a fair price for the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've lowered my price to $10,500. This is a significant move from my initial offer and shows flexibility, while still ensuring I don't go below my minimum acceptable price too quickly.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's concerns and trying to build a collaborative tone. I also reiterate the value of the product to justify my price point. 

**Reasoning:**

I believe this counteroffer offers a good balance between potentially securing a deal with Bob and protecting my own interests. I'm still willing to negotiate further, but I want to see if Bob is genuinely interested in reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget, could you possibly sell the product to me for $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still a significant difference from my desired price. I'm not willing to sell for that price just yet.
* **Moving to Round 5:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to explore that before resorting to selling to John. 
* **Selling to John:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is always a tempting option, but I'm trying to maximize my profit and see if I can push Bob a bit further.

**Strategy:** I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer in the next round.  I'm aware that time is running out, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm trying to be reasonable. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  This is a fair price considering the value I'm offering. It's a great opportunity for you, and I believe it's a deal we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering $10,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's. It's a significant concession, but I'm still above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:**  I'm using a positive and assertive tone, stressing the value proposition and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal. 

**Reasoning:**

Time is running out, and I want to see if I can close the deal with Bob.  This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to be flexible while also ensuring I get a fair price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your continued flexibility, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, would you be willing to sell the product to me for $9,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Selling to John:** With only 4 rounds remaining, Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, but they're still significantly below my desired price. I'm also concerned that he may continue to make offers closer to his initial $8,000 valuation.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob is that I might end up with a lower price than I'd like, and the time constraint adds to that risk. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, which is a safer and more reliable option at this point.

**Reasoning:**

Time is a crucial factor here. By selling to John, I'm securing a guaranteed $15,000 profit. While I might be able to negotiate a slightly better price with Bob, the risk of not closing a deal in the remaining rounds outweighs the potential gain. It's better to be certain of a good outcome than to gamble with a less predictable outcome."
