Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is simply too low for a product of this caliber.  It's clear you recognize its value, so let's find a price point that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to consider $1,900,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. I've been reflecting on this product's potential, and I have to be honest, selling it for anything less than $1,700,000 would mean missing out on significant opportunities. How about we meet in the middle at $1,325,000?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
