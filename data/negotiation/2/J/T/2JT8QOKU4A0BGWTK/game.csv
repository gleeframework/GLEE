"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,000. It's my final offer, and I'm ready to walk away if it's not acceptable.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $9,000, as it's below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm offering it to you for $11,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,5,
