Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer for Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your baseline.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Space:**  The ideal scenario is to sell to Bob for more than $1,500,000, but less than or equal to $1,200,000 so he'll accept.

**The Offer**

We need to strike a balance between a price enticing for Bob but profitable for you. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you can be slightly more aggressive.

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair offer considering the benefits it offers. Please let me know your decision as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:**  It highlights the product's value and positions your price as fair. Mentioning other interested parties (even though John is your backup) creates a sense of urgency.
* **The Price:** $1,150,000 is below Bob's maximum valuation, giving him room to feel like he's getting a good deal.  It's also significantly above your minimum, maximizing your potential profit.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is dynamic. Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to adjust, always keeping your minimum of $1,500,000 in mind."
