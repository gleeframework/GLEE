"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,
I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value to both of us. This unique item is worth $1200000 to you, and I believe it could significantly enhance your life or business. My proposal is to offer you this exceptional product at a special price of $1300000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering its worth and the benefits it can provide.

Please let me know if this offer meets your expectations and if you would like to proceed with the purchase. I am here to assist you every step of the way.

Best regards,
Alice
