"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $12,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm hoping to secure this product for closer to $10,000. I believe this price is fair considering the product's value to me and the potential for both of us to benefit from this transaction. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $11,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my range. How about we split the difference and agree on $10,500? I'm confident this price is fair for both of us and allows for a smooth transaction. Let's try to reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not ready to accept $10,500. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering the product for $10,750. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",10750.0,Alice,5,
