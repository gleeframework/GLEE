"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $12,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,1,

,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $10,500? That's still a great deal for you, considering you value it at $12,000.",10500.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm willing to go a little lower, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle on $10,250? This would give you a good deal, while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
