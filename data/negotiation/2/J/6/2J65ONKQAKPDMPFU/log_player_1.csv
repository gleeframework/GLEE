Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?

Bob's offer is significantly lower than our minimum and still quite far from his own valuation. We have room to negotiate."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I need to be realistic about the value this product holds.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges both our positions."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Bob seems stuck at $875,000.  While we could push for more, we're already above John's offer and further negotiation might not be worth the risk of losing Bob."
