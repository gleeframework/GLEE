Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below what I need to consider.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,250,000, which still leaves some room for profit for both of us.  What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to reach a price that works for you, but $950,000 is simply not enough.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. This is my final offer.  If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing hardball and has presented a ""final offer"". While she might budge a little, it's unlikely she'll come down to a price that beats John's $1,000,000 offer.  It's time to cut your losses and secure the deal with John."
