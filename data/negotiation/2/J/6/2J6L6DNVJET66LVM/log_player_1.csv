"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm thinking something closer to $800,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I need to try to push for a higher price.  I can still reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, giving me more room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below what I need to consider.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,250,000, which still leaves some room for profit for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit closer to my price range. However,  $1,250,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. This feels like a fair compromise to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is a bit closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm not willing to settle for less, especially with the option to sell to John for a much better price.  I'll continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm not afraid to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to reach a price that works for you, but $950,000 is simply not enough.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. This is my final offer.  If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
