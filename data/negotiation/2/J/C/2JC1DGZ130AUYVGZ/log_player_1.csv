Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's well below my asking price. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product for $14,000. This is a good starting point as it's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer in a way that highlights the benefit for Bob (a good deal) while also subtly mentioning my own higher asking price to show that I'm not desperate to sell.

**Strategy:** 

My goal is to get as close to my minimum value of $15,000 as possible. By starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, I hope to initiate a back-and-forth negotiation that could lead to a mutually agreeable price. I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't reach a satisfactory point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, I'm not willing to accept it just yet. I believe I can still push for a higher price. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.  I'm confident I can get a better price, especially since I have John as a backup buyer. By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm demonstrating that I'm not desperate and that I'm willing to walk away if necessary. This should incentivize Bob to come up with a more attractive offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above that price point. Given the quality and value of this product, I'm happy to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to accept $13,500. Let me know if you're interested in finalizing the deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** My counteroffer is $13,500.  This splits the difference between my previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $13,000. It shows that I'm willing to compromise while still trying to maximize my profit.
* **Message:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify my price and using positive language (""happy to meet you in the middle"") to keep the negotiation amicable. I'm also emphasizing a willingness to ""finalize the deal"" to encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to close the deal at a price that is closer to my minimum value of $15,000. By splitting the difference and making a counteroffer, I am showing Bob that I am serious about making a deal, but I'm not willing to give up my desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, I'm still looking to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is still below my minimum value of $15,000.  While I'm open to negotiation,  I'm not willing to sell for a price that is significantly lower than my floor.  I've already made two counteroffers and it seems Bob is unwilling to budge much further.  

**Strategy:**

Given the stalemate and my backup option with John, I'm choosing to sell to John for $15,000. This ensures I meet my minimum value and avoid further negotiations that might not be fruitful."
