"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $1200000 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping to recoup a significant portion of the value I see in this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1350000. This reflects the potential benefits we've discussed and allows for a fair return on my investment. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

This final offer is based on the product's value and my need to recover a significant portion of my investment.  It's a fair compromise and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
