"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm proposing a price of $11000 for the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm very interested in the product,  $11000 is a bit higher than I can afford right now.  I'm willing to pay $10500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11200. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11200 is still a bit out of my price range. To make this deal work, I'm willing to offer $10750. This is a significant amount, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that $10750 is a bit higher than your previous offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another concession and counteroffer at $11100. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility in this negotiation. While I'm still interested in the product, $11100 is still a bit too high for my budget.  To show you how serious I am about this deal, I'm willing to offer $10900.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and my financial constraints.  I'm confident that we can reach an agreement at this price.",10900.0,Bob,6,
