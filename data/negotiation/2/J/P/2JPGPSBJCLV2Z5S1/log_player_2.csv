Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm proposing a price of $11000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:**  Save as much money as possible while still acquiring the product.
* **Alice's Offer:** $11,000 is above Bob's maximum budget. 
* **Strategy:**  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price.
