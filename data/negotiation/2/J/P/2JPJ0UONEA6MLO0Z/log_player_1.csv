Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's $120 valuation. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $100 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob while still staying above our minimum acceptable price ($80).
* **Appear Reasonable:**  While aiming high, we don't want to start with an unrealistically high price that might discourage Bob from engaging. 
 
This strategy balances ambition with a good chance of securing a deal that significantly benefits both parties."
