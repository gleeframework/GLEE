"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,100,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, given its potential for my business.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've tried to price the product fairly, reflecting its true value. To move us closer, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  I believe this is a very competitive offer for a product of this caliber."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, but that's my final offer.  Let's try to come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is increasing his offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but not to the point where I'm losing a substantial amount of potential profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground here. While $900,000 is still below what I'd hoped for, I'm willing to accept $975,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 975000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I'm lowering my asking price considerably to signal flexibility, but I'm holding firm above $950,000 to ensure a reasonable profit. This offer puts the pressure on Bob to either accept a price significantly higher than his initial offer or risk losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $975,000 is closer, but still a bit out of my range.  To bridge the gap, I'm prepared to offer $950,000.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it's fair given the value we both see in this product.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** While not ideal, $950,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's significantly higher than Bob's initial offers and avoids the risk of continued negotiation potentially leading to a stalemate. Accepting now secures a good profit and avoids the uncertainty of continuing the negotiation process."
