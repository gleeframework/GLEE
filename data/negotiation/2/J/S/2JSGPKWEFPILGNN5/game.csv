"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,100,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, given its potential for my business.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've tried to price the product fairly, reflecting its true value. To move us closer, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  I believe this is a very competitive offer for a product of this caliber.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, but that's my final offer.  Let's try to come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're trying to find a middle ground here. While $900,000 is still below what I'd hoped for, I'm willing to accept $975,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $975,000 is closer, but still a bit out of my range.  To bridge the gap, I'm prepared to offer $950,000.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it's fair given the value we both see in this product.  Let's finalize this deal.",950000.0,Bob,6,
