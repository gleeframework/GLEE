"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,

I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that I believe is worth more than $1,500,000 to you. My initial offer to sell this unique item to you is set at $1,400,000. This price reflects the exceptional value and quality of the product, which I am confident will provide significant returns for you in the long run.

Please consider this offer carefully. If you are interested in proceeding with the purchase, please let me know as soon as possible so we can finalize the transaction.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Alice 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget ($1,500,000).**  
* **You can get the same product from John for $1,500,000.**  Since this is within your budget, rejecting Alice's offer allows you to potentially negotiate a better price with John."
