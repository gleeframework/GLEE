"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique and valuable item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $250. This is a great deal, considering its worth to me is at least $150. Let me know if you're interested!",250.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a nice product, but $250 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $250 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to my minimum value of $150. How about we meet in the middle at $200? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know what you think!",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go above $100.  It's the most I'm willing to spend right now.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $150 and $100, which would be $125. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know what you think!",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $110, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.",110.0,Bob,6,

"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $110, which would be $117.50. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know what you think!",117.5,Alice,7,
