"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is still a good deal for Bob since he values the product at $800,000.  This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Leaving Room:**  It's crucial to leave room for negotiation.  If I start too low, I might not have enough leverage to get closer to my desired price.
* **Positive Tone:**  My message is positive and emphasizes the value of the deal for both of us. This can help build rapport and keep the negotiation friendly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1000000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $850000 for the product. This is my best offer, considering the market value and my budget. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  While $850,000 is closer to his valuation, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** I need to see if I can push Bob closer to my price point.  Rejecting his offer gives me the opportunity to counter and try to close the gap.
* **Selling to John is Still an Option:**  If negotiations with Bob fall through, I still have the option of selling to John, which guarantees me my minimum desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within your budget, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to make this work."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Lower Price:** I'm lowering my price from $1,000,000 to $950,000, showing a willingness to compromise. This demonstrates good faith and keeps the negotiation moving.
* **Focus on Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to remind Bob why my price is still fair.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation friendly and open to a solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $950000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900000, which reflects the value of the product and my ability to pay.  This is a fair compromise that allows us to both benefit from this transaction.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below My Minimum:** While Bob is showing willingness to compromise, his offer of $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation is Still Possible:**  There's room for further negotiation. I can continue to try and push Bob closer to my desired price. 
* **Selling to John is Always an Option:**  If negotiations with Bob fall through, I can still sell to John for a price that meets my minimum requirement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your understanding of the value of this product.  However, I'm still not comfortable going below $925,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap and finalize this transaction."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm only lowering my price slightly from $950,000 to $925,000, showing I'm willing to compromise but still holding firm.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the value of the product again to remind Bob of the potential benefits of accepting my offer.
* **Positive and Solution-Oriented:** I maintain a positive tone and focus on finding a way to close the deal.  

**Strategy:** I want to keep the negotiation moving and see if I can convince Bob to come up just a little more. If he doesn't, I'm still prepared to sell to John in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm prepared to offer $912500 for the product. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's finalize this deal and move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $912,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $912,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Time is Running Out:**  We're halfway through the negotiation rounds, and I'm not close enough to my target price.  
* **Selling to John Remains an Option:**  I can still sell to John for $1,200,000, which is a much more attractive option at this point.

**Strategy:** I will continue to negotiate with Bob for a few more rounds, but if he doesn't significantly raise his offer, I will be prepared to sell to John to ensure I receive my minimum desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $912,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $920,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and it will allow us to move forward with this deal. I believe this price accurately reflects the value of the product. Let's finalize this and move forward."", ""product_price"": 920000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:**  I'm only lowering my price slightly from $925,000 to $920,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still holding firm on my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I again reiterate the value of the product to remind Bob of the potential benefits of accepting my offer. 
* **Solution-Oriented Tone:** I'm using a positive and solution-oriented tone to encourage Bob to agree to my offer.

**Strategy:** I'm hoping to convince Bob to come up just a little bit more in the next round. If he doesn't, I'm prepared to sell to John and secure my minimum desired price. With only three rounds remaining, I need to start considering the likelihood of a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $920000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to go up to $915000, which is a significant compromise for me, and a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  This is my final offer - let's close this deal and move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation process with only two rounds remaining.
* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:**  His offer of $915,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **Selling to John is the Best Option:**  At this point, it's highly unlikely that Bob will significantly raise his offer, and I'm confident that John will buy the product for $1,200,000.  

**Strategy:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price and avoids further negotiations with Bob, who is unlikely to meet my price expectations."
