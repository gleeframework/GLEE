"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start with a price of $9,000.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $7,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $7,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a lower price. Would you consider $6,800?",6800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're still a bit off on the price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you a price of $7,200. This is my final offer below $8,000, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",7200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I understand this is your final offer below $8,000. To be completely honest, my budget is closer to $7,000. If you can meet that, I'm ready to close the deal right now. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",7000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I've already made significant concessions. I'm willing to meet you at $7,200, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my final offer, and I expect you to accept it if you want the product.",7200.0,Alice,7,
