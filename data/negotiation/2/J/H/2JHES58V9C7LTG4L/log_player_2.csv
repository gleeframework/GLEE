Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I've already made significant concessions. I'm willing to meet you at $7,200, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my final offer, and I expect you to accept it if you want the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear that $7,200 is her absolute lowest price. Continuing to negotiate is unlikely to yield a better result and might push Alice away from the deal. Accepting the $7,200 offer secures a significant saving compared to John's $10,000 price."
