"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,100,000 is below the product's true value.  To move this forward, I can come down slightly to $1,130,000. This offer reflects the product's worth and allows me to make a reasonable profit.",1130000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be firm on the value here.  $1,120,000 is cutting it too close. My final offer is $1,125,000. This is a firm price, and I believe it's more than fair for both of us.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
