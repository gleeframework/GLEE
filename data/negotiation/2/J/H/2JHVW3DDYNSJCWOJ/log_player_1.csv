**Reasoning:**

Bob is stubbornly sticking to a pattern of incremental increases that are not significant enough.  It's clear he's highly motivated to buy but also very price-sensitive.  At this point, it's unlikely further negotiation will yield a price I'm happy with, and the potential gains are outweighed by the risk of losing a guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
