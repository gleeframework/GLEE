Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this product. Given its unique value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I can afford. How about $1,500,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

Bob's offer matches John's standing offer. There's no benefit to potentially dragging out negotiations with Bob and risking a lower final price. It's in Alice's best interest to sell to John now at the guaranteed $1,500,000."
