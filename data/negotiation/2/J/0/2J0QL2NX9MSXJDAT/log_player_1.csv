Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering, Alice! I'm interested, but that price is a little steep for me. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob has hit his maximum valuation of the product at $8,000. It's unlikely he'll go any higher.  It's in Alice's best interest to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John rather than potentially lose money by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
