"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget and the value I expect to derive from the product, I am proposing to purchase it for $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need at least $1,050,000 to make this worthwhile.  This price still offers you a significant savings compared to what you'd pay elsewhere.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
