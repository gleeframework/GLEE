Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000.  This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counters.  However, if he rejects it, I can always go with John's guaranteed $8,000 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum price.  I can't get more from him, and it's not worth it to risk further negotiation.  I'll take John's offer and get my minimum price guaranteed."
