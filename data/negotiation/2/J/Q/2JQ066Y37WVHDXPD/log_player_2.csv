"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. My asking price is $120, what do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaving room for negotiation. This gives us a better chance of reaching a price closer to Alice's value ($80) while staying well below our maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still aiming for a lower price. We'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $100 is closer, but I was hoping to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $95?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

We're nudging closer to Alice's price, showing we're willing to compromise but still aiming for a good deal.  This keeps the negotiation moving while staying within a reasonable range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $98. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it.  Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is getting very close to her known value for the product. While we could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are minimal at this point, and we risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting at $98 is a good compromise."
