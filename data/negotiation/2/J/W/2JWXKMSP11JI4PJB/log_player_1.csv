While I could push for a higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,300,000 makes the most sense at this stage.  Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  It's still a $100,000 profit over John's guaranteed offer.
* **Negotiation Trend:** Bob is consistently increasing his offer, but the increments are getting smaller. It's unlikely he'll drastically increase his offer in the remaining rounds. 
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids the risk of Bob walking away or further protracted negotiation."
