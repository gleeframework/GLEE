"Round 1

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation.  It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to go lower before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. A $100,000 reduction is substantial, but I believe it's still within a reasonable range, especially considering my goal is to save as much money as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but it's still not a deal-breaker.  I'm willing to keep pushing for a lower price.  I'm hoping to get closer to my initial counteroffer of $850,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, but I'm still keeping it below Alice's current offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm serious about getting a good price.  I believe $900,000 is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping Alice will accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $910,000, which is only $10,000 more than my last counteroffer.  At this point, it's getting closer to my target price and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal. It's better to secure the product at a price that is still good, rather than risking getting a higher price from John."
