"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll find it to be a game-changer. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth seeing if you can negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can see the value of this product is worth more to you than that, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1000000. This is my final offer on the table, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to your budget of $1,000,000.  There's no point in risking a further negotiation as you can get the product for the same price from John.  Accepting Alice's offer avoids the potential for a long and drawn-out negotiation that could end with you buying from John anyway."
