Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1200000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand that $800,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can see the value of this product is worth more to you than that, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is my final offer on the table, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
