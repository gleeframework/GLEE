,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1200000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can see the value of this product is worth more to you than that, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1000000. This is my final offer on the table, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
