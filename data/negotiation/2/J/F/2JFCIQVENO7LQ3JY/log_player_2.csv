It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further. You can save a lot of money if you can get her down to a lower price."

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is a good price for you.  You're saving $350,000 compared to buying from John. It's not a huge savings, but it's still a significant amount. It's not worth risking that by continuing to negotiate, as Alice could come back with a higher offer."
