"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset, worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. Consider it a great deal. If you're not interested, I'm confident I can sell it to another buyer for that amount. But, I'd prefer to do business with you.",1750000.0,Alice,1,
