"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is offering the product for $12,000, which is exactly your maximum budget. There's no point in rejecting the offer and risking a higher counteroffer from Alice. Buying from John would be the same price, so accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice."
