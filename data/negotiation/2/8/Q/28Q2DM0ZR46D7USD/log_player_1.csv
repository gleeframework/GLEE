Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it would be incredibly valuable to you, given its potential.  I'm asking for $1,900,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have leverage to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Strategic Markup:** The $1,900,000 offer represents a significant markup from your minimum, but is still within the realm of possibility considering the product's value to Bob. 
* **Encouraging Engagement:** The message is framed positively and invites Bob to engage in the conversation, increasing the chance of a counter-offer. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can always adjust your price downwards, but you can't go back up after a lower offer."
