"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $100.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $100, which is a good starting point to maximize my profit.  It's less than what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly approach:** I'm being friendly and highlighting the value to Bob. This increases the chances of him accepting the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  Offering $100 leaves room for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like I'm being unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal is to maximize profit:** While $90 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired profit margin. 
* **Negotiation power:**  I have room to negotiate further with Bob, as he's shown interest in the product and has already lowered his offer.
* **Risk assessment:** There are still several rounds left, and I'm not yet desperate enough to accept a price that doesn't meet my expectations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet.  How about we split the difference at $95? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by meeting Bob halfway, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my ideal. 
* **Value proposition:** I'm reiterating the value to Bob (""still a good deal for you"") to encourage him to accept.
* **Fairness:** By framing it as ""splitting the difference"" it feels more reasonable and less like a rigid price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the deal:** $92 is very close to my desired price point and significantly higher than selling to John. 
* **Time pressure:** With 6 rounds remaining, there's a chance Bob might walk away or become even more stubborn if I reject this offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could try to squeeze out an extra few dollars, the risk of losing the deal to John isn't worth it at this point."
