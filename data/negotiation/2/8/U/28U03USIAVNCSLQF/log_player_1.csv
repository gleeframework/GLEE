**Reasoning:**

Bob has reached his maximum valuation of the product ($1,000,000). He's unlikely to go any higher. Since you have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000, it makes the most financial sense to sell to John and secure the higher profit.  Continuing negotiations with Bob at this point has a low chance of yielding a better outcome."
