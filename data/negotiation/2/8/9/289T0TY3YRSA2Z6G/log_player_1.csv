Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state why the product is worth this price to Bob, it implies value and benefit.  This is a common negotiation tactic to encourage the buyer to see the product's worth.
* **Backup Plan:** Since you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you can afford to be a little more ambitious with your initial offer to Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer or reject it. You'll need to decide how much you're willing to negotiate based on his response."
