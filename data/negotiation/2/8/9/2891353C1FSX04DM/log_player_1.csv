"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I believe this will give me some room to negotiate downwards if Bob makes a counteroffer.  It's important to start strong and see what Bob's reaction is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's a step in the right direction, it's still below my desired range. I'll counteroffer and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,400,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's latest offer. I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot and we can close the deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  We've been going back and forth, and while I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,350,000 is a good deal.  It's above my minimum and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  It's time to close this deal."
