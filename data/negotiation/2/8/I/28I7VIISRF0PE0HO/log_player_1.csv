Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's an opportunity to make even more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer price of $1,150,000 is:
    *  Significantly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) to give room for negotiation.
    *  Attractively below my guaranteed sale price, incentivizing Bob to act quickly.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of scarcity and encourages a faster decision from Bob."
