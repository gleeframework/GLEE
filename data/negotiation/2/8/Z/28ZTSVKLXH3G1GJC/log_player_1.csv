{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $1,250,000 is higher than Bob's $1,000,000 valuation, giving him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** This leaves room for you to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** This offer is not too aggressive, making it more likely Bob will consider it. 

Remember, you can always walk away and sell to John for $1,500,000 if you feel Bob isn't serious about a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what the product is worth to you. While you could accept it and secure a sale, the price is far too low. You need to stick to your minimum value of $1,500,000 as much as possible. 

You should make a counteroffer that is still within Bob's budget, but closer to your desired price. This will keep the negotiation moving without losing out on a significant portion of the product's value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 simply wouldn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,050,000? This price is still within your budget range, and gives me the opportunity to make this deal work. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** $1,050,000 is exactly halfway between your previous offer of $1,250,000 and Bob's offer of $900,000. This shows you're willing to compromise, making you seem more reasonable.
* **Still above your minimum:** This counteroffer is above your minimum value of $1,500,000, but it's also significantly less than the price John is willing to pay. This helps you maintain leverage.
* **Appealing to Bob's budget:** The message emphasizes that the counteroffer is ""still within your budget range"", making it more appealing to Bob. 

By offering a compromise that still benefits you, you increase the likelihood that Bob will accept your counteroffer, allowing you to secure a sale at a price closer to your desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'd like to make a more significant reduction. How about $950,000? I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, and I believe this price is more reasonable for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your previous offer, it's still far below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  You've already made significant concessions, and accepting this offer would result in a substantial financial loss. 

By rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer, you can continue to negotiate and potentially reach a more favorable price. Remember, John is willing to pay you $1,500,000, so you have the leverage to walk away if you're not satisfied with the offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your need to stay within budget, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. How about $1,000,000? This price is fair to both of us, and allows me to move forward with the sale. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and fair price:** By suggesting $1,000,000, you are again offering a compromise, splitting the difference between your previous offer of $1,050,000 and Bob's offer of $950,000. This emphasizes your willingness to find a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Close to Bob's budget:** $1,000,000 is still within Bob's budget, based on his previous offers. This increases the chance of acceptance.
* **Still above minimum:** This price is above your minimum of $1,500,000, but it's also significantly lower than what John is offering. This gives you room to negotiate further, if necessary.

This counteroffer balances your need to earn a decent price with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation. You're showing flexibility while still protecting your interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,000,000. I'd like to make a final offer of $975,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $975,000 is getting closer to your desired price, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 

You've already made several concessions, and it seems Bob is unwilling to budge much further.  It's clear that continuing to negotiate with Bob is unlikely to result in a price that meets your needs.

Therefore, the best option is to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This guarantees you the maximum profit and avoids further time-consuming negotiations with Bob."
