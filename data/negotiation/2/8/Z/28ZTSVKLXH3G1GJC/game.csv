"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 simply wouldn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,050,000? This price is still within your budget range, and gives me the opportunity to make this deal work. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'd like to make a more significant reduction. How about $950,000? I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, and I believe this price is more reasonable for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your need to stay within budget, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. How about $1,000,000? This price is fair to both of us, and allows me to move forward with the sale. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,000,000. I'd like to make a final offer of $975,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,
