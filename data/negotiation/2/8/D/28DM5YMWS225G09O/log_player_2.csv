"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a fair price.  Would you be interested in paying $140 for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While $140 is less than your maximum budget, there's a chance you could get a better price from Alice.  You're willing to walk away and buy from John for $150, so it makes sense to see if Alice will come down a bit."
