Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. I'm offering it to you for $1,750,000. Let me know your thoughts, and we can go from there."", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, you have room to start high. This allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's value, subtly justifying the high price without revealing your bottom line. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The phrasing suggests you're open to discussing the price further, making Bob feel more in control of the process.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still offering Bob a chance to buy the product."
