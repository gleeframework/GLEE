``` 

This is a good point to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $1,075,000 is a strong profit, even if it's less than your initial aspiration. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate risks Bob walking away or significantly lowering his offer. John's offer is a sure $1,000,000, but you're already exceeding that with Bob.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only a few rounds left, securing the deal now provides certainty."
