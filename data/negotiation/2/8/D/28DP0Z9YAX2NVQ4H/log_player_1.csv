Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make a reasonable offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $600,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $800,000 to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 600000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, $600000 is still a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $500000 for the product,  which is still a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $550000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $525000?  That's a reasonable compromise that would allow us both to reach an agreement.
