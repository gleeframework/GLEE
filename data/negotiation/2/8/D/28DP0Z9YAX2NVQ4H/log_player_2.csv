# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make a reasonable offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $600000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $800000 to you. What do you think?
