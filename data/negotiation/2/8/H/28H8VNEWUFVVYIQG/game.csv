"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $700,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $850,000 is getting closer, but to be honest, my budget is really capped. I could do $750,000, which I think is very fair. If that doesn't work, I might have to explore other options, though I'd prefer to work with you.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $800,000? This is a fair price that acknowledges both our needs. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both. Let's make this happen.",800000.0,Alice,5,
