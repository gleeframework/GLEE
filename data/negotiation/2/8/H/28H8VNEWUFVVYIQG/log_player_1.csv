``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a compromise between my minimum value ($1,000,000) and Bob's maximum value ($800,000). This allows for potential negotiation and leaves room for me to potentially earn more while still keeping the deal appealing for Bob. I'm also including a friendly message to build rapport and encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $700,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum value of $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $700,000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $850,000 is getting closer, but to be honest, my budget is really capped. I could do $750,000, which I think is very fair. If that doesn't work, I might have to explore other options, though I'd prefer to work with you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum value.  I'm confident I can negotiate higher with Bob, or at least get a price closer to my minimum. If this round fails, I can always sell to John for $1,000,000."
