"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I think you'll find valuable.  Given its potential, I'm asking for $9,500.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $9,500, which is above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.
* **Rejection:** Bob should reject the offer as it's not within his budget.
* **Next Steps:** Bob can make a counteroffer in the next round to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save money, but still secure the product.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** Offer a price that's closer to Alice's value of $8,000, but still gives Bob some room for negotiation. This shows Bob is serious about buying but wants a fair deal.
* **Counteroffer Amount:** $8,500 is a reasonable starting point, as it's $1,000 less than Alice's offer and leaves some room for Alice to counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I'm confident this product offers you significant value at $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible. 
* **Alice's Offer:** $9,000. While closer to Bob's budget, it's still not ideal.
* **Rejection:** Bob should reject this offer. 
* **Next Steps:** Bob can counteroffer again, trying to get closer to his desired price.  He should be mindful of the remaining rounds and the potential to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save money, but still secure the product.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  Bob is standing firm on his previous counteroffer of $8,500. This shows he's serious about the deal but won't be pressured into overpaying. 
* **Counteroffer Amount:**  $8,500 is a reasonable offer considering Alice's value of $8,000 and Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.

By sticking with his previous offer, Bob is showing Alice that he's willing to walk away if she doesn't meet him halfway. This tactic could increase the chance of Alice accepting his offer, or at least push her closer to his desired price."
