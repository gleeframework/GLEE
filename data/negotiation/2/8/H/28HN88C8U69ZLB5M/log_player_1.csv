Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Sweet Spot:**  You need to find a price between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999 to make a deal with Bob that benefits you more than John's offer.

**Offer Strategy**

Aim high, but leave room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal.  Here's a possible offer:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I open it up to other potential buyers. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. I believe this price represents a significant return on investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:**  Creating a sense of scarcity and priority can encourage a quicker decision.
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the ""unique value"" subtly reminds Bob why he's interested without directly revealing your bottom line.
* **Strong Price:** This price gives you a significant profit over John's offer while staying under Bob's maximum valuation.
* **Open to Negotiation:** While the message is framed as a single offer, the wording allows room for Bob to counter-offer if he's inclined. 

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept $1,400,000. You might receive a counter-offer, and you'll need to decide if you're willing to go lower. Remember, your absolute minimum is $1,500,000."
