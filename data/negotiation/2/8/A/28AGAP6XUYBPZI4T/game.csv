"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, $2000000 is beyond my budget. I'm interested in exploring a more reasonable price.  I'd be willing to offer $1000000 for it, given its unique qualities.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to compromise on the value of this product just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a counteroffer of $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's unique qualities. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1400000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm committed to reaching a fair deal.  I'm willing to go up to $1200000.  This represents a significant commitment on my part and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
