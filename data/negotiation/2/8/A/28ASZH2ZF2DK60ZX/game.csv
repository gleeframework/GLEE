"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe this price reflects its value. Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Can you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9000 is simply too low. My minimum selling price is $10000, but to show you I'm open to negotiation, I'm willing to come down to $12000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and I believe it's a great opportunity for you. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $12000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to propose a price of $9500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9500 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $11000. This is a fair price considering the value and I think it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's make this happen!",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to propose a price of $9000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",9000.0,Bob,6,
