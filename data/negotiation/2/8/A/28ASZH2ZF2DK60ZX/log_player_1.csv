Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $10,000. I have 8 rounds left to try and get a better price from Bob or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low. My minimum selling price is $10,000, but to show you I'm open to negotiation, I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and I believe it's a great opportunity for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $12000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to propose a price of $9500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still not comfortable selling it below $10,000.  I have 6 rounds left to try and get a better price from Bob or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,500 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value and I think it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to propose a price of $9000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough decision. Bob keeps offering me $9,000, and while it's better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value. I'm starting to run out of time, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price I'm not comfortable with. I think it's best to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John. It's not ideal, but it's the safest option at this point."
