Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a high starting point, as I want to maximize my profit.  I'm also considering the value of the product to me ($8,000) and factoring in some room for negotiation.  Let's see how Bob reacts."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000.  We've been through several rounds of negotiation, and it seems like Bob is not willing to budge much further.  While I'd love to get a higher price, I'm running out of time and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. John's offer guarantees me a decent profit, and I'm happy to accept it."
