"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a great deal on this product, but I need to make a profit, so I'm thinking of selling it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and even higher than her own valuation of the product. It makes the most sense to go with John's offer of $80, which fits within your budget."
