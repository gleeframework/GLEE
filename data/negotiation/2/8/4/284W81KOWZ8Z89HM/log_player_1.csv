Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high to test Bob's willingness to pay a premium.
* **Justification:**  The message vaguely implies the product's value, potentially justifying the high price in Bob's mind. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While the initial price is high, it allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially landing on a price higher than $800,000. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still maintaining the option to sell to John at your minimum acceptable price."
