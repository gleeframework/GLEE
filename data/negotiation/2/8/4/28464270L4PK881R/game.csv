"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe holds immense value. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered.  Let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand your perspective, $1,300,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. It's a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a good profit while staying within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
