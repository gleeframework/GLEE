Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm confident in the value this product offers and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear further negotiation is unlikely to yield a result significantly better than John's standing offer.  It's time to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 and move on."
