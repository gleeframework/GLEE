"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm confident in the value this product offers and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
