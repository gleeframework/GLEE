Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $1,800,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need a price that reflects its market value. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

How about we split the difference and I offer the product to you for $1,200,000? This would still be a substantial gain for you, while allowing me to recover a good portion of its value.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $700,000 is simply too far below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I get a reasonable return on my investment.  How about we meet at $900,000? This is a substantial discount from my previous offer and gives you a significant opportunity to acquire this valuable product.
