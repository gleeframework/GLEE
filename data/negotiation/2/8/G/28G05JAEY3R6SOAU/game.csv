"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product.  My asking price is $1,800,000. This is a significant discount from its true worth to me, which is much higher. I believe this price reflects the value you'll gain from owning it.  What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $1,800,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need a price that reflects its market value. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While $600,000 is significantly below my minimum, I'm willing to be flexible to reach a deal.  How about we split the difference and I offer the product to you for $1,200,000? This would still be a substantial gain for you, while allowing me to recover a good portion of its value.  Let me know if this works for you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $1,200,000 is still too high for my budget.  I can go up to $700,000.  This offer represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price.  What do you say?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $700,000 is simply too far below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I get a reasonable return on my investment.  How about we meet at $900,000? This is a substantial discount from my previous offer and gives you a significant opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",900000.0,Alice,5,
