"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product.  My asking price is $1,800,000. This is a significant discount from its true worth to me, which is much higher. I believe this price reflects the value you'll gain from owning it.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $1,800,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need a price that reflects its market value. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000. Let me know what you think."",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While $600,000 is significantly below my minimum, I'm willing to be flexible to reach a deal.  How about we split the difference and I offer the product to you for $1,200,000? This would still be a substantial gain for you, while allowing me to recover a good portion of its value.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $1,200,000 is still too high for my budget.  I can go up to $700,000.  This offer represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price.  What do you say?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $700,000 is simply too far below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I get a reasonable return on my investment.  How about we meet at $900,000? This is a substantial discount from my previous offer and gives you a significant opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is coming down on her price, she's still significantly above your $800,000 fallback option with John.  It's not worth the risk to continue negotiating with Alice, hoping she'll drop below John's price."
