"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering a product that could be extremely valuable for your business.  While I can't disclose details without a signed NDA, I can assure you it's worth at least $1000000 to me.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a significant discount, as I'm confident you'll recognize its true potential.  Please let me know your decision.  I'm available to answer any questions you may have. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. While she claims the product is worth more to her, you have no way of verifying that. Since you can get the product from John for $800,000, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and go with the more affordable option."
