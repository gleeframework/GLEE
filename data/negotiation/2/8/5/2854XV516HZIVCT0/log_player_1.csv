"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the significant value it holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below the product's worth to Bob ($1,500,000).  There's still room for negotiation, and I'm hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a fair price given the product's value to you.  This is my final offer before I consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. This is my best and final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price,  $950,000 is still a significant discount from what the product is worth to him. I believe I can still get a higher price.  There's still room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still not acceptable. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $975,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value you'll gain from this product.  Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $975,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle again. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough call, but given the limited rounds remaining and Bob's consistent increase in offers, it's likely that accepting this offer will lead to the best possible outcome.  While I'd prefer a higher price, it's better than selling to John for $800,000, and there's no guarantee that I'll be able to get a better offer from Bob in the next few rounds.  Therefore, accepting Bob's offer of $925,000 maximizes my profit."
