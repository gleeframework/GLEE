Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $100."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $120 to Bob, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $100 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate you up, while still securing a significant profit for yourself. 
* **Balancing Profit and Risk:** If you start too high (close to $120), Bob is more likely to reject the offer, and you'll have to settle for $80 from John. This price point balances maximizing potential profit while minimizing the risk of losing the sale."
