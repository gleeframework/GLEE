"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good price, and I appreciate your effort.  However, $725,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is closer to my target. This is a fair price for both of us, and it reflects the value you place on the product.  Let's make this deal happen.",800000.0,Alice,5,
