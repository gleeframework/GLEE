"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I think you'll love. Would you like to purchase it for $120?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks Alice, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $85? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you think $85 is a fair price, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $110 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $95.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than that.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $95. How about we meet in the middle again, at $105? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a good price for this item.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $105 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $97.  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",97.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $97. I'll make one more counteroffer: $108. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to hold out for it.",108.0,Alice,7,
