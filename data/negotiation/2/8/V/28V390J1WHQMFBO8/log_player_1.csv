Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,500,000:**  This is a starting point that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Strategy:** By offering a higher price initially, I aim to gauge Bob's potential interest and willingness to pay more. If he rejects the offer, I can always fall back on selling to John for my minimum price. 
* **Negotiation:** If Bob expresses interest but finds the price too high, I can use this as an opportunity to negotiate a lower price that is still advantageous for me."
