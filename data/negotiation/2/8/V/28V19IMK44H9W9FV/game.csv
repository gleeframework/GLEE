"Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you this incredible product. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I believe it's worth a cool $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I think your price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below what this product is truly worth. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,000,000?  This price reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $1,000,000, which would be $900,000. Can you consider my revised offer?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  However, I'm still firm on the value of this product.  $900,000 simply doesn't reflect the unique benefits it offers.  I'm willing to drop my price to $950,000, meeting you halfway again.  This is my final offer before I consider other options.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're firm on the value of the product, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, which is closer to your original offer. Can you consider my revised offer?",920000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're almost there.  $920,000 is a good offer, but I'm still just a little bit off on my desired price.  How about we split the difference one more time and settle on $935,000?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and would allow us to finalize this deal.",935000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go above $920,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $920,000 and $935,000, which would be $927,500. Can you consider my revised offer?",927500.0,Bob,8,
