Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible while still ensuring I make a profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $140 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still staying above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time Value:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer in John, selling to Bob quickly might be preferable to waiting for the guaranteed sale.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting the best possible price from Bob and ensuring a sale."
