"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that right away. I believe I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $1,000,000.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to sell for $1,075,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1075000 and $1000000. How about $1037500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,037,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,037,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,037,500 is a good compromise. It's closer to my desired price than selling to John, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the remaining rounds."
