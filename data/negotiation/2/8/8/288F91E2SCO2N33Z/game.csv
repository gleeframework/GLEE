"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price of $1,700,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this price reflects the value of the product to me while staying within my financial limits. I hope we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to at least get $1,500,000 to make this deal worthwhile.  This is a very valuable product, and I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's keep talking.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. I've done some research and found that the market value of this product is closer to $1,300,000 based on similar transactions. Considering this, I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and our previous discussions.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your research and appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,300,000 is still not enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $1,400,000 to make this work.  This is a one-time opportunity, and I believe this price is fair given the value of the product to you.  Let's finalize this deal now.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer. We're very close to a deal, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you at $1,425,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize this right now.",1425000.0,Alice,7,
