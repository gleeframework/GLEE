Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  You know Bob values the product at $1,000,000. 
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,200,000 (because John will buy it at that price).
* **Finding a Middle Ground:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a potential win-win:
    * Bob gets the product for $150,000 less than its worth to him.
    * You make a $150,000 profit compared to selling to John.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the deal attractive enough for him to accept."
