"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident you'll find this a fair offer considering the return on investment you'll gain.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can't go above $8,000.  This is my absolute maximum.  Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below the product's value.  I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet in the middle.  How about $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a substantial increase from my initial offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",10000.0,Bob,4,
