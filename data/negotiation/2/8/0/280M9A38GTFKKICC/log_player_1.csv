Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can't go above $8,000.  This is my absolute maximum.  Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below the product's value.  I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet in the middle.  How about $16,000?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a substantial increase from my initial offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his offer is still significantly below the product's value to me. Accepting $10,000 would be a considerable loss compared to John's guaranteed offer of $15,000. It's time to move on to the guaranteed sale."
