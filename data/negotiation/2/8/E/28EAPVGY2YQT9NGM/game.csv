"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a price of $2000000. It's a significant investment, but I believe the value it brings will far exceed your costs.  I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial arrangement.  What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product's value. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. How about $1200000 for the product?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1200000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure I receive a price that reflects the product's true worth. How about we split the difference and settle on $1600000? This allows us both to come to an agreement that's fair and beneficial. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise with your offer of $1400000.  However, I'm still a bit off on that price. To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $1450000?  This would give us a deal that recognizes the product's value and fits within your budget constraints.  Let's work together to finalize this agreement.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
