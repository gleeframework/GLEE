"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a price of $2,000,000. It's a significant investment, but I believe the value it brings will far exceed your costs.  I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial arrangement.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a high price ($2,000,000) sets the bar and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** Emphasizing the product's value to Bob can encourage him to consider the offer even if it's initially high. 
* **Open-Ended Question:**  ""What are your thoughts?""  keeps the dialogue open and allows Bob to express his initial reaction. 
* **Strategic Reserve:**  I'm still willing to sell to John for $1,500,000, so this offer leaves me some room to negotiate downwards if necessary."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product's value. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. How about $1200000 for the product?
