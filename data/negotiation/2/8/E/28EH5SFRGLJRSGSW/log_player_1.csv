{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above my minimum of $10,000 but leaves room for negotiation, acknowledging Bob's potential value for the product.  I'm hoping to maximize my profit, but I also want to keep the negotiation open to avoid losing Bob as a buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $10,500 is still a bit low, and I believe I can get a better deal.  It's worth pushing a bit further with Bob before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $11,000?  That's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate you working with me on this. While $11,000 is closer, I'm still only comfortable paying $10,750. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise.  It's higher than John's offer, and it keeps the negotiation with Bob open, potentially leading to future deals.  I don't want to risk losing a potential long-term customer by pushing for a few hundred dollars more."
