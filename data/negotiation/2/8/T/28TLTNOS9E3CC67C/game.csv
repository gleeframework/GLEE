"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. It's a great deal for both of us, allowing me to earn a decent profit and giving you access to a product worth $800000 to you. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1400000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product, which would still allow you a significant profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This still leaves a healthy profit margin for me and would be a great deal for you considering the value of the product to your business. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1200000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950000. This would be a significant savings for me, and still allows you a profit. Let's find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950000 is still unfortunately too low for me. Considering the value of the product to you, I believe a price of $1100000 would be fair for both of us. This would be a significant gain for you while allowing me to achieve a reasonable profit. Let's try to reach a mutually agreeable solution.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1000000 for the product. This would be a significant benefit for both of us - a good price for me and a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
