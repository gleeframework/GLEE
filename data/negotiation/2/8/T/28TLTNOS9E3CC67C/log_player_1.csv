{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, allowing me to earn a decent profit and giving you access to a product worth $800,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to make a counteroffer. It also leaves me a significant margin above my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000), but doesn't price myself out of the deal completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1400000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product, which would still allow you a significant profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, it's still better than nothing. However, I believe I can do better. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.

Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1200000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950000. This would be a significant savings for me, and still allows you a profit. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Although Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $1,500,000. I will reject his offer and make another counteroffer in the next round."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1000000 for the product.

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Rather than continuing to negotiate with Bob and risk a further decrease in price, I'll take the guaranteed $1,500,000 offer from John."
