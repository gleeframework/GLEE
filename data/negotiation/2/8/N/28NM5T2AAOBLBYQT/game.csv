"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I understand this product is valuable to you, but given my budget and the product's potential, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  This is still a significant gain for you and would allow me to acquire the product within my price range. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1,200,000 just yet. Considering the product's value and potential benefits, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
