"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is significantly below the product's value to me ($1,500,000), so rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to try and save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I understand this product is valuable to you, but given my budget and the product's potential, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  This is still a significant gain for you and would allow me to acquire the product within my price range. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1,200,000 just yet. Considering the product's value and potential benefits, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement. What do you think?

``` 
Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is a good compromise. It's still below my maximum price of $1,500,000 and closer to the price I'm willing to pay.  It's a good deal for both of us."
