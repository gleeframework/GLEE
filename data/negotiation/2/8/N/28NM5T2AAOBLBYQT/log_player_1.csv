"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I understand this product is valuable to you, but given my budget and the product's potential, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  This is still a significant gain for you and would allow me to acquire the product within my price range. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1,200,000 just yet. Considering the product's value and potential benefits, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
