"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product, which is what it's worth to me.  Let's meet in the middle.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your offer is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I think the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1250000. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $1000000.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1250000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my original offer of $1000000. This is the highest I'm willing to go.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
