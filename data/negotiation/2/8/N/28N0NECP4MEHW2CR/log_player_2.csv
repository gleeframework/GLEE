"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. This is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high.  We have room to negotiate and should try to get closer to our budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $100 is a bit too high for me though. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer but still within a reasonable range. This leaves room for negotiation while making it clear we're looking for a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $70 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. This still leaves room for a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but we're still not at a price where it makes sense to forgo John's offer. We'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $80? That seems fair to both of us."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We've countered with our ideal price. This makes it clear what we're willing to pay while giving Alice a chance to accept a price that's still profitable for her."
