Round 5
Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're close, but $775,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more attempt to meet you in the middle. My revised offer is $850,000, but I'm getting close to my minimum price, and I'm not sure how much further I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's clear that Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $850,000. While we could continue negotiating, it's becoming risky. We're running out of rounds, and Alice seems to be firming her position.  At this point, cutting our losses and buying from John for $1,500,000 is the safer option, even if it's not ideal."
