"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I was hoping to keep my budget around $12000 if possible. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I can offer you a compromise - I'll meet you halfway at $13500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $13500 is closer to my budget, I would like to see if we can come to an even lower price. Could we possibly agree on $13000 for the product?",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit, so I can offer it to you for $13250. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $13000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I hope it meets your expectations.",13000.0,Bob,6,
