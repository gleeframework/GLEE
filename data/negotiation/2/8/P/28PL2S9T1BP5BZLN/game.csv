"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $8,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $9,000? I feel that's a fair offer.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,5,
