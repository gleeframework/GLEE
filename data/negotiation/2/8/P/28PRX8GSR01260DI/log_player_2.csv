"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it offers. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $800,000 from John. Rejecting this offer opens the door for further negotiation with Alice or allows you to proceed with purchasing from John at your desired price."
