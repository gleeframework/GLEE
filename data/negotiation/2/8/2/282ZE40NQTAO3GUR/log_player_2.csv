"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $130, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You want to save as much money as possible.  $130 is still too high, so rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your budget. While $85 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $100? That's a fair price considering the value of the product.

While $100 is better than $130, it's still more than you're willing to pay. You can try to negotiate further and see if you can get a better deal."
