"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for. Given the unique value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This reflects a significant compromise from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let's try to make this work.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
