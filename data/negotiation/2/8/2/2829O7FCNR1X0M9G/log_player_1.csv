I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit above my minimum of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

$100 is far too low for me. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 175}

I'm going to counter with $175. This is still a decent profit for me, and hopefully, it's a price Bob will be willing to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$120 is still too low for me.  I'll make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price slightly to $160. This is still a good profit margin for me, but it might be more appealing to Bob. Hopefully, we can come to an agreement this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is clearly not willing to meet my minimum price. It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $150. It's not ideal, but it's better than selling it at a price I'm not happy with."
