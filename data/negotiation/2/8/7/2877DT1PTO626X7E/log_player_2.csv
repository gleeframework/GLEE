"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth no more than $10,000 to Bob, so accepting Alice's offer of $20,000 is not a good option. Buying from John for $10,000 is also a possibility, but it's worth exploring if Alice might come down in price.  Rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer allows for negotiation and potentially a better deal."

While $18,000 is closer to Bob's limit, it's still significantly higher than the $10,000 he's willing to pay.  Rejecting and counteroffering again gives Bob a chance to further negotiate and potentially reach a more favorable price."

Alice is still too high for Bob's budget, and even though it seems like Alice is coming down in price, it's unlikely she will budge to $10,000. It's time to cut his losses and buy from John for a guaranteed $10,000."
