"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $140. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 140
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While I could try to negotiate for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $130 is a good deal. It exceeds my minimum acceptable price ($120) and avoids the risk of the negotiation failing and having to sell to John for less."
