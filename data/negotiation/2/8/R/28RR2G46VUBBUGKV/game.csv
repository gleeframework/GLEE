"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is still a great deal for both of us, considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,000,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,150,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
