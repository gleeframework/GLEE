"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is still a great deal for both of us, considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,150,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,150,000 is still higher than my budget. While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and potentially increasing her price is too high. 

Buying from John for $1,000,000 is the most secure option to ensure I acquire the product within my budget."
