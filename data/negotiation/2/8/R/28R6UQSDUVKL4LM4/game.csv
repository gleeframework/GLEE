"Hi Alice,  $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in your product but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $130, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $130 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we split the difference and I pay you $105?  I'm really serious about getting this product.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's settle on $115.  I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my willingness to negotiate. What do you say?",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $100 for your product.  It's a fair price, and it's the most I can do. Let's close the deal.",100.0,Bob,6,
