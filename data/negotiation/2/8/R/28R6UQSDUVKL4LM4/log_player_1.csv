Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $150. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in your product but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not willing to sell the product for $80, it's worth more to me than that. I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $130, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $130 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we split the difference and I pay you $105?  I'm really serious about getting this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $105 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's settle on $115.  I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my willingness to negotiate. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $100 for your product.  It's a fair price, and it's the most I can do. Let's close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm not willing to go lower, and I don't want to risk further rounds of negotiation that might result in a lower price. Selling to John for $120 ensures I get my minimum and avoids further potential loss."
