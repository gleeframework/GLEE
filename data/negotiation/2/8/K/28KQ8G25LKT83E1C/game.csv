"Alice, your offer is way too high. While I'm interested in the product, I'm only willing to pay $800000 for it. This is my best offer, and if you're not interested, I'll have to move on to another seller.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. However, I was expecting a higher offer. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1200000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1200000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value. Let's meet in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is a compromise, but it's still a great price for a product of this value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
