"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is way above your budget and what you know the product is worth to John.  It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limit. How about we start at $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Setting a Target:** Our goal is to pay as little as possible, ideally closer to John's $10,000 price.
* **Leaving Room:**  By starting at $8,000, we signal that we're willing to move, but Alice will need to come down significantly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. Let's meet in the middle at $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  While Alice moved from her initial offer, $14,000 is still significantly higher than John's $10,000 price.
* **Negotiation Room:**  We have time and room to negotiate further. Alice is showing willingness to come down on her price. 
* **Leverage:**  We know Alice values the product at $15,000, so there's a good chance she'll go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $10,000? That's the absolute highest I can go."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We're moving closer to the midpoint between our initial offer and her current price, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Firm but Fair:** By stating $10,000 is our ""absolute highest,"" we're setting a firm boundary while still aiming for a price that works for us.
* **John as Leverage:** We haven't revealed John's offer, but it serves as a strong point of leverage in case Alice is unwilling to budge much further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $10,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $18,000 for the product. Let's meet in the middle again, but this time at $16,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:**  Alice has increased her offer after we countered at our maximum price. This suggests she's not willing to negotiate within a reasonable range.
* **Saving Money:** John offers a guaranteed price of $10,000. Accepting Alice's offer would mean overpaying significantly.
* **Time:** We've already spent several rounds, and Alice's tactics indicate this negotiation could drag on with little chance of success. It's better to secure the deal with John now."
