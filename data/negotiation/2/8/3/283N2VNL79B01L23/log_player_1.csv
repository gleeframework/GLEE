Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  I would be willing to pay $6,000 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer.  $6,000 is too low for me, and I believe I can get a better price from Bob or John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $8,500?  That's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $8,500 is still a little steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,250? I think that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,250 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $7,250 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $7,750?  That's a fair price considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 7750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, you're right, we're getting closer.  How about $7,500?  That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm close to accepting Bob's offer,  I've only got 4 rounds left. To be sure I get a price that is closer to my desired range, I'll go ahead and sell the product to John for $8,000. It's a guaranteed sale and I don't want to risk losing out on a better deal."
