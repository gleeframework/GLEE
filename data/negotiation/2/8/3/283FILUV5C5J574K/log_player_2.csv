"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $145. This is a special offer considering its value to you and I believe it's a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
We can try to get a better price from Alice, as her initial offer is still higher than our ideal price and what she values the product at. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $145 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to leave room for negotiation and signal we're looking for a good deal.
* **Not Insulting:**  While low, $110 is still above Alice's perceived value of the product ($120), so it's not an unreasonable opening counteroffer.
* **Polite & Direct:** The message aims for a collaborative tone, expressing interest while clearly stating our price target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. Considering the value of the product to you, I am willing to negotiate further. My counteroffer is $130 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice moved down in price, signaling she's willing to negotiate. However, $130 is still above our target price and offers room for further bargaining. We haven't hit a point where accepting Alice's offer is better than buying from John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $120? I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We're proposing a price directly between our last offer ($110) and Alice's counteroffer ($130). This common negotiation tactic can signal fairness and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Hitting Alice's Value:** $120 is the price Alice values the product at, making it a strong offer that's likely to be appealing while staying within our budget. 
* **Maintaining Politeness:** We continue to use a polite and appreciative tone to foster a positive negotiation environment."
