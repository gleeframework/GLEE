Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still willing to work with you to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to give a bit more, but I'm not willing to go below $108. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.

Alice is clearly unwilling to go much lower, and while I could try to haggle a couple more dollars off, $108 is a reasonable price within my range. It's better to accept a decent deal than risk losing it by pushing too hard."
