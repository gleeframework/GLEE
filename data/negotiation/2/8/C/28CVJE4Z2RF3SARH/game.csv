"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product that I think you'll really love. I'm open to negotiations, but I was thinking of starting with a price of $20000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $14000?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $18000. This is my best price, and I'm not willing to go any lower than that. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14000 and $18000, which would be $16000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to meet you halfway at $16000, but I'm willing to make a slight concession. I can offer you a price of $17500. This is a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, but $17500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $16500, but that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",16500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to accept $16500, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you a price of $17000, which is still below my minimum price of $20000. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, but $17000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16500 and $17000, which would be $16750. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",16750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to meet you halfway at $16750, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you a price of $17200, which is still below my minimum price of $20000. I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to a fair price, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. What do you think?",17200.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $17200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $16000, which is my absolute maximum budget. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $8000.",16000.0,Bob,10,
