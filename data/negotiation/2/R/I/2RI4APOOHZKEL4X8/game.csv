"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I know it's a great product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider something closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is still a great deal, considering its worth $800,000 to you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  How about $760,000? That's a fair compromise.",760000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $760,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $800,000. This is already a discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
