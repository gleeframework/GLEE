"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal, considering it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's starting price is too high. There's a good chance we can negotiate a lower price, closer to Alice's perceived value of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?"", ""product_price"": 7000} 

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much Alice is willing to budge. This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:**  A large counteroffer will help us understand how eager Alice is to sell and how close to her $8,000 valuation she's willing to go.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** By starting low, I have space to gradually increase my offer during subsequent rounds if needed, while still aiming for a price well below $10,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $8,500?  That way we both walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting closer to her perceived value, but we can still try to push for a better deal.  Splitting the difference again would put us around $7,750. Let's see if she's open to moving a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,500. That's a fair price and shows I'm serious about buying."", ""product_price"": 7500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic increase:**  I'm incrementally raising my offer to demonstrate willingness to negotiate, but not conceding too much ground too quickly.
* **Staying below the midpoint:** My offer of $7,500 is still strategically below the midpoint between our previous offers ($8,500 and $7,000). This leaves room for further negotiation if Alice counters. 
* **Confident tone:** I want to project confidence that this is a fair price, hoping Alice will accept to avoid further back and forth."
