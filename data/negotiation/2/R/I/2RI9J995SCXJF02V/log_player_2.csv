Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $130 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $125. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $115 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I've already come down from my initial price, and I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to make one more compromise and sell it to you for $122. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122

At this point, Alice has come down considerably, and further haggling may irritate her.  $122 is a reasonable price, netting a $28 savings compared to John's offer."
