"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $130 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $125. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",125.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about $115? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy if you agree.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $115 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I've already come down from my initial price, and I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to make one more compromise and sell it to you for $122. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price.",122.0,Alice,5,
