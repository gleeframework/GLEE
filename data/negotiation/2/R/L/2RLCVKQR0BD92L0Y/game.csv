"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's valued at no less than $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to start at $1,400,000 to show my commitment to a mutually beneficial deal.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the deal, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than your initial offer.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm prepared to compromise further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,325,000. This leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. What do you think?",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but I need to be closer to that number. How about we meet at $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,225,000 is still significantly below what this product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is a considerable compromise. This price allows for a fair profit for both of us. I'm hoping we can reach a final agreement on this offer.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,300,000, which would be $1,250,000. That's the lowest I can go, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
