Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,200,000, leaving room for negotiation. 
* I want to gauge Bob's initial interest and see if he's willing to play in this price range. 
* This high offer also allows me to use the ""anchor bias"" to my advantage, potentially influencing Bob's perception of the product's value."

* It's a significant improvement from his previous offer, and we've already gone through several rounds of negotiation. 
*  Given that John is a guaranteed sale for $1,200,000, accepting this offer would give me an extra $50,000. 
*  At this point, I'm willing to accept a slightly lower price to close the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation. 
* It's important to balance maximizing profit with minimizing risk."
