"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to make a smart investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get a better price by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob is starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's initial price, aiming to find a middle ground.
* **Fairness:**  $8,500 is still a good deal for Alice, as it's above her valuation of $8,000. This shows Bob is willing to negotiate, but also has a clear price point in mind. 
* **Openness to Negotiation:** The message includes positive language (""Thank you,"" ""I appreciate"") to maintain a friendly tone and keep the negotiation open."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $9000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Alice has met Bob halfway, lowering her price from $9,500 to $9,000. This shows a willingness to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Value:** $9,000 is still within Bob's budget and is a significant saving compared to John's price of $10,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While further negotiation might be possible, there's a risk of Alice rejecting further offers and leaving Bob to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer secures a good deal with minimal risk."
