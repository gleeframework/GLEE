Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm offering a price that's still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer, showing willingness to compromise. This might increase the chances of a deal and avoid the risk of losing out to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $78 is closer to my minimum, it's still below it.  To avoid further negotiation and the risk of Bob rejecting my counteroffer, I'll choose to sell to John for $80. This guarantees me my minimum profit and avoids any potential delays or uncertainty."
