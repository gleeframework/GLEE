"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $120. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $140. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of this product.",140.0,Alice,3,
