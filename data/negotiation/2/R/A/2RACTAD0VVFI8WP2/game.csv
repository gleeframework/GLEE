"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $95. It's a fair price considering the product's quality and uniqueness. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'll meet you at $92. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal.",92.0,Alice,5,
