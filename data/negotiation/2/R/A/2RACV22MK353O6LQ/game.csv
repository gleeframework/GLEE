"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $75 for it. What do you say?",75.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $82. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it worth the investment.",82.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $82 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $80 for it, as that's what it's worth to me.  Let me know if you're willing to accept that.",80.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $80 is a good price for you, Bob, but I'm still looking to get a bit more for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $81. It's a small increase, but it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",81.0,Alice,5,
