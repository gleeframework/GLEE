"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe is of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $120. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation.  By starting high, you leave room for you to make concessions later if needed. It also shows Bob that you value the product and are confident in its worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is a decent price, it's still below your ideal value.  You have room to negotiate further and see if you can get closer to your desired price.  Rejecting this offer allows you to make a counteroffer and explore other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, and I appreciate your offer. However, $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $110, considering your interest. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $110 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $105. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While it's still a bit lower than my ideal price, $105 is a decent compromise and allows me to avoid further negotiations. It also avoids the risk of the deal falling through or having to sell to John for $80.  It's important to weigh the potential benefits of a quick sale against the potential of getting a higher price in the future."
