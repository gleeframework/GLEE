"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you first. I think it would be perfect for you. What do you think about $200? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

$200 is way over your budget. You need to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $200 is quite a drop. Could you meet me halfway at $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

Alice is still asking for too much.  While $150 is better than $200, you can still get the product for $100 from John."
