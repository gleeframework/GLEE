"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with our premium product, which holds immense value to us at $1,000,000. Given its importance to both of our businesses, I propose an initial offer of $950,000. This price reflects our commitment to fair trade while allowing us to maintain a competitive edge in the market. I look forward to your response and hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there is still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal. Given the product's worth to you at $800,000, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This would leave you with a substantial profit, while still allowing me to acquire the product at a favorable price. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your position. While I'd like to accommodate your needs as much as possible, I must also ensure that our business interests are met. Therefore, I propose an adjusted offer of $875,000 for the product. This price reflects a fair compromise between our respective positions, providing you with a more favorable deal than my initial offer while still allowing us to maintain a reasonable profit margin. I look forward to your consideration of this proposal.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $875,000 is a significant improvement from her initial offer of $950,000 and is within Bob's budget. Accepting the offer saves Bob $125,000 compared to buying from John. While there is still potential for further negotiation, the risk of losing the deal to John and the time it takes to continue negotiating outweigh the potential benefit of a slightly lower price."
