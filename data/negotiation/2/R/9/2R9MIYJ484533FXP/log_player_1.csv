Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$115 is a good starting point.** It's above Bob's perceived value of $100 but below your minimum of $120. 
* **The message is friendly and encouraging.** It emphasizes the value of the product and leaves room for negotiation.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize your potential profit.**  $115 is a good starting point for negotiation.
* **Maintain a positive relationship with Bob.** A friendly tone can encourage a smoother negotiation process.
* **Keep the option to sell to John open.**  You can always switch to John if the negotiation with Bob doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $105?  I'm sure we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum.** You've stated that you're not willing to sell below $120. 
* **Accepting his offer would result in a loss.** You'd be selling the product for less than it's worth to you. 
* **Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation alive.**  You can still potentially get a better price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **You should make a counteroffer.**  You could propose something like $110, explaining that $105 doesn't meet your needs. You'll want to find a compromise that is fair to both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but $105 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further,  How about $110? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer demonstrates your willingness to negotiate while still protecting your minimum price.
* **Highlight Value:** The message reminds Bob of the product's value and emphasizes the benefit of the offer.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** The message encourages further discussion and a potential compromise.

This approach aims to:

* **Secure a better price:**  $110 is closer to your desired price than Bob's initial counteroffer.
* **Maintain a positive negotiation environment:**  The message remains friendly and invites Bob to continue the discussion.
* **Preserve the option to sell to John:** You can always switch to John if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - $107.50.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below your minimum.** You've stated that you're not willing to sell below $120.
* **Accepting his offer would result in a loss.** You'd be selling the product for less than it's worth to you. 
* **Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation alive.** You can still potentially get a better price from Bob or sell to John.

**Next Steps:**

* **You should make a counteroffer.** You could propose something like $112.50, explaining that you're willing to compromise but can't go lower than that. This strategy aims to reach a middle ground while still ensuring you earn a reasonable profit."
