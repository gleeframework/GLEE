"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to get something truly valuable. I believe it's worth more than what others might offer, but let's find a fair price together. How about we start at $90?",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $70. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget concerns, but I must respectfully decline the $70 offer. Our product is indeed unique and valuable, and I believe it deserves a higher price. How about we compromise at $85? This still allows you to save some money compared to other potential offers, while also ensuring we receive a fair value for our product.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $85 is getting closer to what I'm willing to pay. However, I'd like to make a lower offer. How about $75? I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I understand your position, and I'm willing to consider a middle ground. How about we set the price at $80? This is still above your initial offer, but it's below our starting point. I hope this helps us reach an agreement that respects both our interests.",80.0,Alice,5,
