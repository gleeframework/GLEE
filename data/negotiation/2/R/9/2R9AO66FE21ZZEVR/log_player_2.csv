Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm thinking of a price of $820,000. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $760,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $810,000 for the product. That's the lowest I can go. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is stubbornly clinging to a price above your alternative option.  It's unlikely she'll go as low as $800,000 in the remaining rounds. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John."
