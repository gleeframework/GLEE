"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product.  I think it could be highly beneficial to you. Given its value, I'm asking for $1,400,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and creates the perception of value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is high, it's not so high as to be insulting to Bob. This suggests a willingness to negotiate.
* **Focusing on Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price.
* **Open-Ended Question:** Asking ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but  $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below your minimum acceptable price. While you want to make a deal, accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss compared to your backup option (John). It's worth negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential benefits for you. I could consider a price of $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of what we're discussing."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:** Showing you heard and considered Bob's offer helps maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere.
* **Firm but Fair:**  While rejecting the low offer, the counteroffer  demonstrates flexibility by coming down in price. 
* **Reiterating Value:**  The message again subtly emphasizes the product's value to justify the higher price point.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:**  The counteroffer aims to move the negotiation closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value proposition, but I have to stick to my budget.  Could we meet halfway at $1,225,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is now above your minimum acceptable price and very close to your backup offer from John. Accepting this offer secures you a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially falling through."
