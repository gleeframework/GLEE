"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value. While I can't disclose the exact nature of it, I can assure you it's worth at least $1000000 to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000.  This is a chance to acquire something truly special, and I believe you'll find the value far exceeds the price. What do you say?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
