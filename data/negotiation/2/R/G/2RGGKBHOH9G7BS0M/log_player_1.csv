I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable value, but it allows room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and understand his potential budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price to $1,300,000. This is still above my minimum, but shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  I'm hoping this price is attractive enough to Bob while still ensuring a good profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but $1,150,000 is still too low. I'm going to reject his offer and counteroffer again."

I'm lowering my price again to $1,250,000. This is very close to my minimum acceptable value, but I'm still hoping to get a slightly better deal. I believe that Bob is serious about buying the product, and I'm hoping that this price will be enticing enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

```

This is a tricky situation. Bob has finally reached my minimum acceptable value, but I'm not convinced he's willing to go any higher.  Rather than risk further negotiation that could drag on and potentially lead to a lower offer from Bob, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. This ensures a secure sale at my minimum acceptable price, and I can focus on finding other buyers for similar products in the future."
