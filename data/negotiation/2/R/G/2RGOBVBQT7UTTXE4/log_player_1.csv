Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe is of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than your minimum, giving you room to negotiate down if needed. It's also lower than Bob's perceived value, giving him an incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $95 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired price.  I'm going to counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $107.50? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 107.50} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your proposal, Alice. I understand your position, but I would like to keep my budget in mind. Would it be possible to consider $100 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $100 is close enough to my desired price point and significantly better than selling to John. Accepting Bob's offer allows me to maximize my profits in this scenario."
