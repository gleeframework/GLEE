Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to your business endeavors. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **High but Potentially Acceptable:**  Offering the product at $1,450,000 is a significant markup for you but still under Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000. There's a chance he might be willing to pay a premium for a product he deems essential.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong initial offer, it leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down slightly if he's particularly price-sensitive."
