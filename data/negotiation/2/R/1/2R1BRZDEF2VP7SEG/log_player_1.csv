Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $900,000 is a strong offer, the product's intrinsic value and potential warrant a higher price point. Would you consider $1,150,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $950,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, his ""final offer"" is still significantly below John's guaranteed price. It's time to move on and secure the $1,000,000 sale."
