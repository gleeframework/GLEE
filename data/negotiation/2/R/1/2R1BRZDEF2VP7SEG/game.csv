"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $900,000 is a strong offer, the product's intrinsic value and potential warrant a higher price point. Would you consider $1,150,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $950,000. This is my final offer.",950000.0,Bob,4,
