"I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $750,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $880,000. This is a fair compromise, considering its potential worth to you.",880000.0,Alice,3,
