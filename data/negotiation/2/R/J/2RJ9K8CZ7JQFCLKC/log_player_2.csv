"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking $100 for it, which is a great deal considering its value.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's start the negotiation. Alice's first offer is higher than your maximum price, and significantly higher than her own valuation. There's room to haggle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $85."",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's offer but still above her valuation. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is friendly and avoids any accusatory language, fostering a positive negotiation environment."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 just doesn't work for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $95.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down in price, but it's still above our target. We have room to negotiate further before considering John's offer. Let's see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?  That's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This is a common negotiation tactic that can feel fair to both parties.  
* **Still Negotiating:** We're still below our maximum price and above Alice's valuation, giving us some bargaining power. 
* **Clear and Concise:**  The message keeps the negotiation moving forward without being overly aggressive or passive."
