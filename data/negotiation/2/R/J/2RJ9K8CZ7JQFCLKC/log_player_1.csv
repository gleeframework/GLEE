{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking $100 for it, which is a great deal considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$100:** This price is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Message:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, increasing the likelihood of his acceptance. 
* **Open-Ended Question:**  This encourages Bob to engage in the conversation and counter-offer if needed. 

This approach balances maximizing my profit with encouraging negotiation.  I'm confident that Bob will find the value in the product and we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $85. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is above my minimum of $80, it's still lower than my desired profit margin. I believe there's more room for negotiation, and I'm confident that I can secure a higher price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter-offer and potentially reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 just doesn't work for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $95.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm starting with a counteroffer of $95, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also holding firm on my desired profit margin.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my counteroffer. This helps me maintain a strong negotiating position.
* **Direct Question:** I'm ending with a direct question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?  That's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $90 is a good compromise. It's higher than my minimum selling price of $80 and closer to my desired profit margin. Accepting this offer ensures a reasonable profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation or having to sell to John for a lower price."
