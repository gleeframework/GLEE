Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer you $900000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
