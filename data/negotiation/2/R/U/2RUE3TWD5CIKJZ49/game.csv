"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $175 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $150. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $150 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $125, which is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $145. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $145 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $135.  This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",135.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $135 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $145 and $135. I can offer it to you for $140. It's the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",140.0,Alice,7,
