,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $700,000 is certainly appealing, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its worth.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that balances the product's value with my budget.",850000.0,Bob,4,
