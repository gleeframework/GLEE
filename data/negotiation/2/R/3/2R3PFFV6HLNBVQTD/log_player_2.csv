{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

{""product_price"": 8000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming for his maximum budget of $8,000, but he needs to be realistic.  He's increased his offer from $8,000 to $9,000, showing Alice that he's willing to compromise while still trying to save as much money as possible. This counteroffer demonstrates his willingness to negotiate while staying within a reasonable range."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's ideal price is still $8,000, Alice's offer of $10,000 is within his budget and a significant improvement from the previous round. Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product while still saving a considerable amount compared to Alice's initial price.  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower price, but the risk of losing the product to another buyer or exceeding his rounds is too high."
