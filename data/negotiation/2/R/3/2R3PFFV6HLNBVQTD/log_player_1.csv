"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I believe it's a fair starting point, considering Bob values the product at $8,000. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit while still securing a sale.  I'm going to start high and be prepared to negotiate down, but only to a point where I'm still comfortable with the price. If Bob rejects this initial offer, I'll be ready to counteroffer. 

I'm also mindful of the time limit and the option of selling to John for $15,000. This provides me with a safety net and limits my risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While it's tempting to take the $8,000, I believe I can get a better price. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. I'm confident that I can secure a price closer to my desired range. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll need to formulate a counteroffer to Bob, considering his rejection and my goal of earning as much money as possible. I'll aim for a price that's higher than $8,000 but lower than $13,000 to show flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price to $11,000 in this counteroffer. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer of $13,000, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer of $8,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profitable margin. 

**Strategy:**

By lowering the price but not going too low, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to meet me halfway. I'm also keeping in mind the time limit and the option of selling to John for $15,000. This gives me leverage and ensures I don't settle for a price that is too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to my acceptable price range, it's still below my target.  I'm not willing to settle for that price just yet. I believe I can still get a better deal.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to continue negotiating. By rejecting this offer, I'm signaling to Bob that I'm not desperate and that I'm willing to walk away if necessary. This is also a tactic to gauge his willingness to compromise.

**Next Steps:**

I'll need to formulate another counteroffer, aiming for a price between $9,000 and $11,000.  My next offer will need to be more appealing than $9,000 while remaining profitable for me."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price to $10,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer of $11,000 but still higher than Bob's offer of $9,000. This demonstrates flexibility while keeping my profit margin in mind.

**Strategy:**

By meeting Bob halfway, I'm hoping to reach a middle ground and secure a deal. The $10,000 price point is a reasonable compromise that could appeal to Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll be closely monitoring Bob's response and adjusting my strategy accordingly. If he rejects this offer, I'll need to decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John for $15,000, considering the remaining rounds and my desire to maximize profit."
