"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it brings.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $1,050,000? I'm confident this price is still attractive for you, while allowing me to get a fair return on the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $950,000 simply doesn't work for me. Let's be realistic,  I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. This is my final offer before I consider other options.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above $1,000,000. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.",975000.0,Bob,6,
