Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary. I know the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, so I'm not losing anything if Bob rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $700,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm offering $900,000 to Bob. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not quite there.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm offering $850,000 to Bob.  This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'm hoping that Bob will finally accept this offer, as it's a fair price for both of us."
