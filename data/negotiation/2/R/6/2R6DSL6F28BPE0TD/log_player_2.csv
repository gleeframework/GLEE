Round 7

# Alice's message: Bob, you're really close, and I appreciate how we've worked together to reach this point.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is using a common negotiation tactic by introducing another interested buyer to pressure you.  While she might be bluffing, her final offer of $810,000 is still higher than John's price of $800,000. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation, especially since you have a guaranteed option with John."
