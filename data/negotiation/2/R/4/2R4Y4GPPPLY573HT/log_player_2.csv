# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still not comfortable going down to $700,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going down to $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $800,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm not willing to go any lower, so I hope this is a price you're willing to accept.

This is a good deal for Bob. Alice is at her lowest price, and getting the product for $800,000 is a significant saving compared to John's $1,500,000 price."
