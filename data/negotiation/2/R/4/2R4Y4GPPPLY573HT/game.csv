"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $950,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider something closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still not comfortable going down to $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going down to $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $800,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm not willing to go any lower, so I hope this is a price you're willing to accept.",800000.0,Alice,5,
