"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $17000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $15500?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to my asking price.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14750. Can you consider this offer?",14750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $14750 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering your previous offer and my need to make a fair profit, I'm willing to go down to $15250.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",15250.0,Alice,5,
