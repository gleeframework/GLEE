Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,500. This is a price that is above his valuation but still leaves some room for negotiation. I believe this is a good starting point that gives Bob a chance to counter without me having to drop to his valuation immediately.  I am also mindful that I can always sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low for me. While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to sell for significantly less than my minimum value of $15,000.  I'll reject his offer and send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $13,500. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still above his valuation. I'm hoping this will be a more acceptable price point while also allowing me to earn a reasonable amount."
