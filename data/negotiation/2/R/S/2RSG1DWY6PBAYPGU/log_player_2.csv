{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth exploring negotiation with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for it, reflecting its worth to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above what I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Alice to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000.  This reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is a compromise, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,000,000, so I'll offer $950,000. This is the best price I can offer, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still above my budget.  While there's a chance we could negotiate further, I'm concerned about running out of rounds.  To ensure I get the product within my budget, I'll purchase it from John for $800,000."
