Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,250,000, which is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:**  A positive and encouraging message helps build a rapport and increases the chances of Bob accepting the offer.
* **Focus on value:** Highlighting the value of the product for Bob can make him more likely to consider the offer.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've successfully made a good deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer.
*  I'll keep in mind my fallback option of selling to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum value of $1,500,000, I'm still not comfortable accepting it.  There's room to negotiate further, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. 

**Next steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price somewhere between $1,100,000 and my initial offer of $1,250,000.  I'll keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiation with Bob falls apart."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $1,100,000 doesn't quite meet my needs.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This still represents a great value for you, and it's a fair price considering the product's worth. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I've moved closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Value emphasis:** I'm still emphasizing the value the product offers to Bob, reminding him of the potential gains. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I've used language suggesting openness to further negotiation (""Let's see if we can reach an agreement""), which keeps the door open for a mutually agreeable outcome.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great!  We've reached an agreement.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to evaluate the situation carefully. I might consider making a final counteroffer (perhaps $1,125,000) or, if he's unwilling to budge, I might opt to sell to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,075,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,075,000 is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still a significant distance from what I'd like to get. I'm not comfortable accepting it yet, as I believe there's still some room for negotiation. 

**Next steps:**

I'll make a final counteroffer to Bob, likely aiming for something between $1,100,000 and $1,125,000. This will be my last attempt to reach an agreement.  If Bob rejects this final offer, I'll sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a solution that works.  I'm willing to make one last concession and offer you the product for $1,125,000. This is my final offer, as it's getting very close to my minimum price.  Let me know if you're willing to accept it. If not, I'll need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** I'm clearly stating this is my final offer, creating urgency and potentially pushing Bob to accept.
* **Compromise:** I've moved closer to Bob's last offer, demonstrating a desire to reach a deal.
* **Alternative:** I've subtly reminded Bob about my other option (selling to John), which could incentivize him to accept.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! We've reached a mutually acceptable price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll move forward with selling the product to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not at my target. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000, but I need you to meet me there. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer of $1,075,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better result, and I'm unwilling to compromise that much on my own value.

**Next steps:**

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This ensures I get my desired price and avoids further negotiations that are unlikely to be fruitful."
