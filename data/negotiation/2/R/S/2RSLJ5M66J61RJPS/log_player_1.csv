Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible, but she also wants to make sure Bob accepts the offer.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000, offering it slightly above that gives him an incentive to buy.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, making Bob less likely to stall or lowball. 

**Why this strategy works:**

This approach aims for a win-win situation, albeit slightly more favorable to Alice:

* **If Bob accepts:** Alice gets $150,000 more than what he values the product for.
* **If Bob rejects:** Alice can sell to John at her desired price of $1,200,000."
