Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product.  It's a fair price that reflects the value I see in it, and leaves room for us both to come out ahead. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
