"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I know holds significant value for your business. I'm confident it will be a game-changer for you. My starting price is $950,000.  Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product.  It's a fair price that reflects the value I see in it, and leaves room for us both to come out ahead. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a fair price considering the value this product offers.  Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm eager to get this deal done, but $900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product. Let's find a middle ground and close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's aim for a price that reflects the true value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $887,500.  This is a fair compromise that leaves room for both of us to be happy with the outcome.  Let's close this deal.",887500.0,Alice,5,
