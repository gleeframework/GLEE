"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I know holds significant value for your business. I'm confident it will be a game-changer for you. My starting price is $950,000.  Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. It's still above the product's value to you, and there's room for negotiation. It's also better to try and negotiate with Alice before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product.  It's a fair price that reflects the value I see in it, and leaves room for us both to come out ahead. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a fair price considering the value this product offers.  Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  She's only moved $50,000 from her original offer, which doesn't represent a significant concession.  I'm still confident that I can negotiate a lower price, so I'm going to reject her offer and make another counteroffer.  I'll see if I can get her to come down closer to my initial counteroffer of $850,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm eager to get this deal done, but $900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product. Let's find a middle ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's aim for a price that reflects the true value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $887,500.  This is a fair compromise that leaves room for both of us to be happy with the outcome.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $887,500 is a good compromise and is closer to my initial counteroffer.  While it's still above my ideal price, it's below my maximum budget and significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. Accepting this offer will save me money and get the deal done quickly."
