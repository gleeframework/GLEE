Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's still a decent profit for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $11,000 is a bit more than what Bob thinks the product is worth, giving him some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** This offer keeps you above your minimum price of $12,000, ensuring you're not losing money.
* **It's open to negotiation:** The message implies a willingness to negotiate, leaving room for Bob to counter.

This approach allows for a potential deal while keeping the option of selling to John if the negotiation doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price of $12,000. I'm not willing to sell at a loss. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my minimum while keeping the option of selling to John as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $11,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we settle at $11,250? It's a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  $11,250 is a midpoint between my last offer and Bob's offer. It shows willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum.
* **Highlight the value:**  The message emphasizes the ""good deal"" for both of us.
* **Keep the option open:** The message doesn't close the door completely, leaving room for further negotiation. 

This counteroffer aims to get closer to a deal while still protecting my minimum price and keeping the option of selling to John open."
