Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible, but she also wants to avoid Bob rejecting the offer. 
* **Understanding Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000. Any offer significantly higher than this is unlikely to be accepted.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $1,150,000, there's a chance Bob might counter-offer, giving Alice room to potentially negotiate a price slightly lower but still higher than her guaranteed sale to John. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between ambition and realism, maximizing the potential profit for Alice while still making the deal attractive enough for Bob to consider."
