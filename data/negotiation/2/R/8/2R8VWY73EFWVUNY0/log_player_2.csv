"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial to you. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While the product is only worth $12,000 to Alice, her offer of $14,000 is still a better deal than buying from John for $15,000. Accepting this offer saves Bob $1,000."
