"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations.

You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is too high. You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $950,000 is still significantly more than the product's worth to Alice ($800,000).  It's better to counteroffer and see if you can get a better price. You have 9 rounds left, giving you room to negotiate."

```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  This counteroffer is a significant decrease from Alice's initial price.  You're proposing a price that's closer to the product's worth to Alice, but still leaves room for her to make a profit.
