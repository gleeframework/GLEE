"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell quickly. I would like to counteroffer at $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given its value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1,250,000 to make this work. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $1,350,000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial asking price and leaves room for further negotiation.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
