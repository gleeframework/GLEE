"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true worth and potential. I could consider a price of $1,050,000.  This reflects a more reasonable compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with a price above $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be more aggressive on the price. Can we discuss a price of $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't let it go for less than $1,000,000. I believe this price accurately reflects the value it will bring to your business.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
