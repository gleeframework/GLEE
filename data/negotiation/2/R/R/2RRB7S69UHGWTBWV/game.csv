"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, but I have to make a living. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $110. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $90.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on this deal. I'm counteroffering at $105. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my costs.",105.0,Alice,5,
