"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $800,000. Would you be willing to consider a price of $850,000? I believe this would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to sell the product and me to get a great deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget considerations. However, the value of this product  is significantly higher than what you're proposing. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects a more accurate valuation and ensures a fair deal for both of us. ",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,150,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
