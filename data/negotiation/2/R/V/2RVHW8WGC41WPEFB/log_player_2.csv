"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to be aggressive but still reasonable.  Offering $12,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit since her value for the product is $10,000. This counteroffer gives Alice a chance to accept and still get a good deal, while also encouraging further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is a good compromise. Bob can save $1,500 compared to buying from John, and it's still a good deal for Alice as she's making a profit.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a slightly lower price, but it's unlikely to be worth the potential risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers and leaving Bob with no option but to buy from John at a higher price."
