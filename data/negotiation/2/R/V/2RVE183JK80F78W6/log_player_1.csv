{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 allows for some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Above Minimum:** The price is still comfortably above your $10,000 minimum, ensuring a good profit even if Bob negotiates down slightly. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have John as a backup at $10,000 provides leverage. You're not desperate, so you can confidently aim high with Bob."
