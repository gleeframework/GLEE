"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a highly valuable product. I believe you'll find it to be a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product,  $1200000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to offer $1000000 for it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1100000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1100000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit above my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $1050000?  This would allow us both to walk away satisfied.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm now offering it to you for $1075000. This is a bit above your last offer, but I believe it's still a reasonable compromise considering the product's value.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
