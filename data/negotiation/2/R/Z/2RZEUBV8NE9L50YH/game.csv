"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise. How about $1300000? This still gives you a substantial profit, and it's a fair price for the value of this product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1300000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1100000, which still allows you a good profit and is a fair price considering the value for me. Let's find common ground here.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1100000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $1200000? This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get a great deal while ensuring I get a reasonable return on my investment. Let's make this happen!",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is still a bit higher than I can go.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1150000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement quickly.  What do you think?",1150000.0,Bob,6,
