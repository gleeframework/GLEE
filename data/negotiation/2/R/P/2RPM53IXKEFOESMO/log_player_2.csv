# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's something I know you'll find incredibly valuable, and I'm confident it will be a game-changer for your business.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me at this time. I'm very interested in the product and believe it could be beneficial for my business, but I'm only able to offer $950,000. This would still give you a good profit while also being within my budget. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm confident this product can generate significant value for your business, which justifies a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This still gives you a substantial return on your investment, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her offer, but it's still significantly higher than my ideal price. While I'm interested in the product, I'm not ready to accept a price that's too close to John's offer. I'll continue to negotiate with Alice in hopes of finding a price closer to my initial counteroffer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to compromise further and offer $1,000,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased with your continued willingness to negotiate. While I appreciate your offer of $1,000,000, I need to stay closer to my original position.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. While I appreciate your effort, $1,050,000 is still a little outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still not quite in my sweet spot. I'm going to continue negotiating, but if she doesn't come down further, I'll have to seriously consider John's offer. It's getting close to the point where the potential savings from continuing to negotiate with Alice might not be worth the risk of losing the deal altogether."
