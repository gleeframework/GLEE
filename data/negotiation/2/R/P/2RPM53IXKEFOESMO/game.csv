"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's something I know you'll find incredibly valuable, and I'm confident it will be a game-changer for your business.  My asking price is $1,200,000.  This represents a significant opportunity for both of us.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me at this time. I'm very interested in the product and believe it could be beneficial for my business, but I'm only able to offer $950,000. This would still give you a good profit while also being within my budget. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm confident this product can generate significant value for your business, which justifies a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This still gives you a substantial return on your investment, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to compromise further and offer $1,000,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a substantial profit for you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm pleased with your continued willingness to negotiate. While I appreciate your offer of $1,000,000, I need to stay closer to my original position.  Given the potential for significant return on your investment, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This compromise demonstrates my desire to reach an agreement, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. While I appreciate your effort, $1,050,000 is still a little outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my part and gives you a good profit margin. Let's find a middle ground and finalize this deal.",1025000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but I need to stay closer to my target price. To demonstrate my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $1,040,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. What do you say?",1040000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,040,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,032,500. This represents a significant compromise on my part and would still leave you with a substantial profit. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement on this price.",1032500.0,Bob,8,
