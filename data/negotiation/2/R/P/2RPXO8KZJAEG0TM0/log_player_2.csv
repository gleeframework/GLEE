"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I value your offer, $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $775,000 is still a bit lower than what I can accept.
