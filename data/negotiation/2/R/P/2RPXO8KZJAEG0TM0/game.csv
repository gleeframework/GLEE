"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be a valuable asset to your business. My asking price is $950,000. This reflects the significant value and potential it holds. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $700,000.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I value your offer, $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to meet you halfway. This price still reflects the product's significant value and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $775,000 is still a bit lower than what I can accept.  Considering the product's value and our previous discussions, I believe a price of $825,000 would be a fair compromise.  This allows both of us to benefit from the transaction, while still recognizing the product's worth. Let's try to reach an agreement on this figure.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000. This is a strong offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",800000.0,Bob,6,
