"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,000,000 price point. Would you consider lowering the price to $950,000? I believe this would still provide a good return on your investment while allowing me to secure the product within my financial limits.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $950,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $975,000? This allows me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a good deal. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I understand the value of your product and appreciate your offer. However, I must respectfully decline at $975,000. I would like to propose $960,000 as a compromise. This price still allows you a reasonable profit while staying within my budget constraints. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",960000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your continued negotiation.  I'm willing to come down slightly from my previous offer to $965,000.  This represents a good compromise and allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome.  Let's make this happen!",965000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I've carefully considered our negotiations, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial solution. I would like to propose $962,500 as a counteroffer. This price reflects a fair compromise between our positions, and I believe it will allow us to conclude this transaction successfully.",962500.0,Bob,6,
