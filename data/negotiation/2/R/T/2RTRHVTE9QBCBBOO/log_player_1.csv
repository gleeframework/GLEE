Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some more money. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 and even lower than his own perceived value of $1,000,000.  I will counteroffer to try to reach a more reasonable price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still looking to save some more money. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers.
