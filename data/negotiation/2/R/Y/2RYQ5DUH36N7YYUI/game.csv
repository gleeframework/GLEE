"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's something you've expressed interest in before, and I think it could really benefit your operations. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that allows me to earn a good return on my investment while also giving you a significant advantage. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,
