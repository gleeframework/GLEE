Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I know you see great value in.  Given its unique nature and my understanding of your appreciation for it, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a significant opportunity to acquire something truly special."", ""product_price"": 950000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $800,000 and you have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000,  you have room to negotiate. A high starting price anchors the negotiation in your favor.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""unique nature"" and Bob's ""appreciation,"" the message subtly justifies the high price without revealing your minimum.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, allowing you to still likely secure a deal above your minimum."
