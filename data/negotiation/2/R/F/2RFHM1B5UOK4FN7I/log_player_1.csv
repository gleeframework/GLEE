"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it establishes a high baseline and leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play in this price range.  I'm prepared to lower the price if necessary, but I want to start strong."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $600,000 is a decent offer, it's far below what the product is worth to me.  I'm not willing to settle for that amount yet. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground.  I need to make sure I get closer to the value I'm aiming for."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still a respectable price.  I believe this is a reasonable compromise that might entice Bob to consider. If he's serious about buying, he'll need to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $700,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can bridge the remaining gap.  It's only round 4, and I have more room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $850,000.  This is getting very close to my minimum, but I'm still holding out for a bit more.  It's important to remember that I have the option to sell to John for $800,000, so I need to make sure I get a higher price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get more, it's important to recognize that we're at a stalemate.  I can sell to John for the same price, so accepting Bob's offer guarantees me my minimum, and avoids the risk of further negotiations.  It's time to close the deal."
