Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before anyone else. Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I know Bob values the product at $10,000 and I have a guaranteed sale at that price, I want to start high to see if I can secure a better deal. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The $15,000 offer leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can potentially settle on a price higher than my minimum.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is friendly but emphasizes the product's value to justify the high asking price. 
 
**Important Note:** This strategy assumes I have limited information about Bob's negotiation style or financial limits. With more information, I could potentially tailor my offer for a better outcome."
