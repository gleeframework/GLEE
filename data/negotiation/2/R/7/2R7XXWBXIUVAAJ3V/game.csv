"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly below what I need. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $7,500?  Let's meet in the middle.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $7,500 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $6,750?",6750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $6,750 is still too low. How about we split the difference and go with $7,125?  That's a fair price for both of us.",7125.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we both want to strike a fair deal here. How about we settle at $7,000? That's a nice round number we can both feel good about.",7000.0,Bob,6,
