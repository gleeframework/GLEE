Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're close to your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good point to accept the offer. Alice has come down considerably and is unlikely to go much lower.  A $50,000 difference is a reasonable compromise at this stage."
