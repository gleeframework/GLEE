Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price reflects its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think the product is worth less to me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe I can get a better price.  I have 8 rounds left and can use them to negotiate a higher price. Selling to John right now is not the best option as I want to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000 to show you my commitment to this deal. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Can you meet me halfway again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, and while $1,250,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still push for a slightly higher amount. I have six rounds remaining and can continue to negotiate. Selling to John at this point would be premature, as I am getting closer to a price that is more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to this deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time.  Let's close this at $1,275,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 1275000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,225,000 for the product. I'm getting close to walking away and buying from John, but I still think this product is a good fit for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, I am still hesitant to accept. He is using John as leverage, but with 4 rounds remaining, I believe I can still push for a better price.  There's a possibility he will offer a higher price in the next round to avoid losing the deal entirely."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,225,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000 one last time. This is my final offer, and if it's not acceptable, I'll have to consider selling to John.  It's your call."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
