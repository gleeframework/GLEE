{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
``` 

I've decided to sell the product to John. While I was willing to negotiate with Bob, his offers have consistently been below my minimum acceptable price. I've reached a point where the potential gains from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of not securing a sale at all.  John's offer of $1,000,000 meets my minimum requirements, and I'm confident that this is the best outcome for me."
