"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was hoping to negotiate a better price. Considering the product's value to me is capped at $800,000, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm eager to hear your thoughts on this proposal.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer and your perspective. I understand your position, but the product holds significant value beyond the $1,200,000 mark.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what it can bring to your operations.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the value you place on it. I'm eager to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
