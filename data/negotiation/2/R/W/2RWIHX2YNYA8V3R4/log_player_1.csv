I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it's a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, giving me room to negotiate.  I'm not sure what Bob's value is, but I'm hoping he'll find this price attractive enough to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$10,000 is way too low for me.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 17000}

I'm counteroffering at $17,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This is my final offer. I'm willing to accept $15,000, which is my minimum value. If Bob doesn't accept, I'll move on and sell the product to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is not willing to budge, and I'm at my minimum value. It's not worth continuing to negotiate with him. I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000."
