"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a unique and valuable item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you reaching out. While I do like the product, $90 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $75 for it. What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $82. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value you'll get from this product. What do you think?",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $82 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $78, which is closer to my budget.  Let me know what you think.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $78 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $81. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",81.0,Alice,5,
