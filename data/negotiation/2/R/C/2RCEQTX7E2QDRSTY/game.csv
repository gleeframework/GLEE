"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our top-of-the-line product. I think it's a great fit for your needs and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price is fair considering the value you've stated, and it leaves room for both of us to make a good deal. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, but I still need to make a profit. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your budget and the product's worth to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $875,000 for the product. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $887,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.
