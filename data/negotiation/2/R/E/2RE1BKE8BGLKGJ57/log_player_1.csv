Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. While I'm interested in the product, I'm only able to go up to $1,350,000. This is a fair price that allows for a profit for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, my original price reflects the true value and potential of this product. Let's meet in the middle - I can offer it to you for $1,700,000."", ""product_price"": 1700000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you think the product is valuable, but $1,700,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer. This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the potential of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear further negotiation will be in smaller increments. John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000 which is more than Bob's current offer and avoids further risk of Bob stalling or the deal falling through."
