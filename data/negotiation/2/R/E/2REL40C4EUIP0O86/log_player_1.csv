"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This is a good starting point. It's above your minimum of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation.  By mentioning the value to Bob, you're subtly trying to appeal to his sense of fairness."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is better than selling to John, it's still far below the product's worth to Bob ($15,000) and leaves significant room for negotiation. There's a good chance Bob is willing to pay more, and rejecting his offer gives us a chance to push for a better price.  We have plenty of rounds left, and there's no rush to settle for a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $11000 is closer, but I'm still looking to get a better price. I'm willing to offer $10500.  This is a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to walk away happy.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is tempting, it's still below the product's worth to Bob.  We've already established that he's willing to pay more than $10,000, and by rejecting this offer, we maintain leverage for a higher price. We still have several rounds to negotiate, and there's no need to settle prematurely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,750.  This is a fair compromise, and it's closer to our previous negotiations. Let's make this deal happen.  "", ""product_price"": 10750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're showing flexibility by coming down from our previous offer but still maintaining a significant profit.  This counteroffer also signals to Bob that we're serious about reaching a deal but won't settle for a price too far below the product's worth."
