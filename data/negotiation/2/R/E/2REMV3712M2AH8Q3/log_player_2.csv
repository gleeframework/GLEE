{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Value:** Alice values the product at $8,000.
* **Your Value:** You value the product at $10,000.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is offering the product for $9,500. 
* **John's Price:** John is selling the product for $10,000.

**Analysis:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it still leaves a $1,500 profit margin for her. You can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice, but since John is your backup option at your maximum price, it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price with her."
