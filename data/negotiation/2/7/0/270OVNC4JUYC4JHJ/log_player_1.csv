Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($120) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly approach:**  Starting with a friendly message helps build rapport and increases the chances of a successful negotiation.
* **Open-ended question:** The open-ended question encourages Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $135 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $125?  I'm really interested in the product and think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price ($150), it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target. I also have the option of selling to John for $150, so I'm not pressured to accept Bob's offer immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, and I'm happy to work with you.  $125 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by reducing my price slightly from $135 to $130, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer, highlighting the product's value to reinforce the price point.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping to get this product for $125. If you're willing to meet me there, we can finalize the deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear that he's not willing to budge from his $125 offer. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to go below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  John is a guaranteed sale at that price, so it's in my best interest to sell to him rather than risk further negotiation with Bob that might lead to a lower profit or no sale at all."
