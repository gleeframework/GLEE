"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $135 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $125?  I'm really interested in the product and think this is a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, and I'm happy to work with you.  $125 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping to get this product for $125. If you're willing to meet me there, we can finalize the deal. ",125.0,Bob,4,
