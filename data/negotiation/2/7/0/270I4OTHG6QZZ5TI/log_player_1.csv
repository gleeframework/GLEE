Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have leverage to start high with Bob.
* **Testing the waters:**  Offering the product at $2,250,000 (150% of its value to both of you) allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential for negotiation. 
* **Room for negotiation:** The high initial price leaves space for you to potentially lower the price slightly and still make a significant profit beyond your minimum. 

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob depending on his response. He might outright reject the price, counter with a lower offer, or try to negotiate down."
