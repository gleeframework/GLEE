"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $11,000?  This gives you a good deal, and it's still a worthwhile profit for me.",11000.0,Alice,3,
