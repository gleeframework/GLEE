"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth at least $10,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is higher than your maximum budget of $10,000. You have a better alternative: buying from John for $10,000.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you can save $1,500."
