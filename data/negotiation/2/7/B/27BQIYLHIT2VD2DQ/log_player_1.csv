Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it could be worth even more to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible without losing him to a rejection.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation (Optional):** While not explicitly part of the scenario, starting slightly higher leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate.  
* **Avoid Being Too Greedy:** Offering it at $150 might make Bob feel like there's no benefit to him engaging in the deal.

This strategy aims to secure a deal that's significantly better than the $100 backup offer from John."
