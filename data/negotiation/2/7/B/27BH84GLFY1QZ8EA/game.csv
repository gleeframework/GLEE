"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,900,000 is significantly above my budget.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,400,000.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it represents a fair starting point for further discussion.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $1,900,000 represents the high end of the product's potential, I'm open to finding a middle ground.  How about we consider $1,650,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the true worth of what's being offered.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,650,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,525,000 for the product. This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it reflects a fair value for both of us.",1525000.0,Bob,4,
