**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, but still keeping it below my maximum budget.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying, but I'm still trying to get the best price possible. I'm hoping she'll see the value in closing the deal and come closer to my offer."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

I'm confident that John will sell me the product for $10,000, so I'm going to cut my losses and buy from him."
