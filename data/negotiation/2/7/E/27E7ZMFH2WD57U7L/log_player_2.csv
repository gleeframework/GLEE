"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than my usual asking price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your budget of $800,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You still have 9 rounds to work with, so you have time to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that benefits both of us, and it's the maximum I can afford. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a decent profit while giving you a good value. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This price is within my budget and is a good compromise. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price is still within my acceptable range and reflects the value of this product. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is getting closer to your desired price range, but $950,000 is still slightly above your budget. It's worthwhile to continue negotiating since you still have 5 rounds remaining and there is potential to close the deal at a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  While $950,000 is tempting, it's still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $925,000. This price is a fair compromise and allows us to both reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close!  I'm willing to come down to $940,000.  This is a fair price that still allows me to make a good profit.  Let's close this deal and call it a day! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $940,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $940,000 is still higher than your budget of $800,000. With only 3 rounds left, the potential for further negotiation is limited.  Since John is offering the product at your desired price point, it's more efficient to buy from him and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
