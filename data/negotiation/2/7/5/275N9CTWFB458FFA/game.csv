"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  It's valued at $1,200,000 to me, but I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000.  This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident this product will be a great asset to you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a little lower than I'd hoped for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This is still a fair price, considering the value of the product and my initial offer.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $1,075,000 is getting closer to my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000. I think this is a reasonable price considering the product's value to me and the initial offer of $1,100,000.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,025,000 is just too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,060,000 as a compromise.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product and our previous negotiations. Let's reach an agreement that's beneficial to both of us.",1060000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting closer to my target, but I still think $1,060,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you at $1,015,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the initial offer of $1,100,000.",1015000.0,Bob,6,
