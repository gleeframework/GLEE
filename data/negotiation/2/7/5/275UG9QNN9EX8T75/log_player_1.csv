"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob's value for the product is unknown. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better price. While $800,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can push for a higher amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $900,000. This shows flexibility while still staying above my minimum.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be appealing enough for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is a good deal. It's significantly higher than my minimum of $800,000 and it seems like a reasonable compromise.  While I could try to push for a higher price, it's risky, as I'm nearing the middle of our negotiations and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
