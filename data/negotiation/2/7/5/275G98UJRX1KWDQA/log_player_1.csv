Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the value of this product is truly exceptional, and $850,000 falls short of what I consider fair. I'm willing to come down slightly to $975,000. I believe this reflects the product's true worth and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $975,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $925,000 is a significant sum, we're still in the early stages of negotiation. Bob is clearly interested and has shown a willingness to increase his offer. Holding firm for now keeps the possibility of securing a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to consider $950,000. This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to make this deal work."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, indicating he's willing to pay a premium over his initial offer. However, the increases are getting smaller.  Holding firm at this stage might signal the value of the product to me and push Bob closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it seems we're getting close. I value your persistence, and to expedite this deal, I'm willing to accept $935,000. This is my final offer, as it reflects the absolute lowest price I'm prepared to accept."",
""product_price"": 935000
}
```

**Reasoning:** This offer reflects a strategic balance:

* **Urgency:**  Framing it as a ""final offer"" adds weight and might encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Concession:** It shows movement from my previous position, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Profitability:**  While not ideal, $935,000 is still a substantial profit margin and avoids the risk of Bob walking away completely. 

By setting a firm limit, I'm aiming to bring the negotiation to a close while maximizing my potential return."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $915,000. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob has decreased his offer after I presented my ""final offer."" This signals that he is unlikely to meet my desired price point. It's time to cut my losses and move on to the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  While continuing negotiation with Bob is possible, it carries the risk of his offer going even lower or the negotiation reaching an impasse, leaving me with less time to finalize a deal with John."
