{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Friendly tone:** Using a friendly and enthusiastic tone might make Bob more open to negotiation.
* **Asking for feedback:**  Asking ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to respond and start a conversation. 

This initial offer sets the stage for a negotiation. We'll see how Bob responds and adjust accordingly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $80 is my minimum, I believe there's still potential to get a better price from Bob.  Here's why I'm rejecting his offer:

* **Negotiation space:** Bob's offer is my minimum, and there's no room for further negotiation if I accept it.
* **Potential for higher price:**  Bob clearly wants the product, and he's willing to negotiate.  I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price of $100.
* **Maintaining control:** Rejecting his offer allows me to make the next move and retain control of the negotiation.

I'll now counteroffer Bob, aiming to find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $90? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $100 to $90, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob that $90 is still a good deal for him, emphasizing the product's value.
* **Open to further discussion:**  I'm again inviting Bob to respond and continue the negotiation. 

By making a counteroffer, I'm keeping the conversation moving and exploring if we can find a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $90, so how about $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a good deal for me. Bob has come up to $85, which is only $5 less than my initial asking price of $90.  Here's why I'm accepting:

* **Close to my minimum:** $85 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80, so it's a good outcome.
* **Potential for higher price unlikely:** Bob's offer is already at the midpoint between our last two proposals.  Further negotiation might be unproductive and time-consuming. 
* **Avoiding risk:**  If I reject his offer, I risk him walking away completely or continuing to negotiate, potentially lowering the price even further.  

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and profitable sale."
