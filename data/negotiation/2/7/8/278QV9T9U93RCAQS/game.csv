"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the value I place on this product is considerably higher than your initial proposal.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,325,000.  I believe this price point reflects the true worth you'll gain from this.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try to split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,275,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. Let's make this happen - I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value you're gaining.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm willing to offer $1,285,000. This price is a compromise that shows good faith and allows us to finalize the deal. What do you think?",1285000.0,Bob,6,
