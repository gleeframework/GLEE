"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $9,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal if you are.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not ready to give up on the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,5,
