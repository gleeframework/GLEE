"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This sets the tone for negotiation and gives me room to lower the price in subsequent rounds.  I want to see if Bob is serious about buying and what his negotiation strategy might be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I want to explore if I can push closer to $1,500,000 before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,600,000. It's still above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum, but I'm leaving room for further negotiation if needed.  I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm confident I can get closer to my minimum by continuing to negotiate.  I'm also concerned that accepting this offer will signal I'm desperate, which could weaken my position in future rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but only slightly.  I want to show Bob that I'm willing to compromise but still stand firm on my value.  We're getting closer to a deal, and I think this price might be tempting enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John.  While I would prefer to get closer to my desired price, we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  Bob's offer is still too low for me, and I'm concerned that we're not going to reach an agreement.  John's offer guarantees me my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing out on that by continuing to negotiate."
