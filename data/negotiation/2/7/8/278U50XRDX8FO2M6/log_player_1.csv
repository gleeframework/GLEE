Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product. I understand its value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. My initial offer is $1,400,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little too high for me. Could we settle around $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is far too low.  While it's tempting to take the quick win, I'm confident I can do better.  I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Considering its value to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? I think that's a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,150,000 is better than his previous offer, it's still below my minimum.  I'll counter again, but I'm starting to feel the pressure. If this doesn't work, I might need to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price, and I appreciate your willingness to move.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down further to $1,250,000.  This is my final offer before I consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
