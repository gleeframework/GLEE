"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little too high for me. Could we settle around $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Considering its value to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? I think that's a fair deal.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price, and I appreciate your willingness to move.  However, $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down further to $1,250,000.  This is my final offer before I consider other options.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
