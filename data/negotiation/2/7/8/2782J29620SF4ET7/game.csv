"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $17000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. Can you consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $12000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get at least $14000 for it. Would you be willing to consider that?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $14000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13000. Can you consider that?",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $13500? I think that's a fair compromise",13500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting a bit too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make another small concession, but I really need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $14000? I think that's as low as I can go",14000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting nowhere, Bob. I'm willing to make one more serious offer, but I need to get at least $14200 for it. I think that's the lowest I can go. If you're still interested, let's meet at $14200. If not, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options",14200.0,Alice,9,

"I understand your final offer, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go up to $14200. I'd like to make a last counteroffer of $12000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options, including buying from John for $10000.",12000.0,Bob,10,
