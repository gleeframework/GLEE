Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe we can reach an agreement within my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $16,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price.  $16,000 is better than $15,000 from John, but I'm still hoping to make more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial asking. I'm willing to come down to $17,000. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 17000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a price of $16,500 for your product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $16,500 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer, and I'm confident I can still make a good profit.  Let's close the deal."
