Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $10,000."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product is highly valued.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give me insight into his level of interest and flexibility. 
* **Backup Plan:** I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, so I'm not pressured to accept anything below that."
