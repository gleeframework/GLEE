"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a substantial gap from what I consider a fair valuation. This product offers significant potential that goes beyond your current assessment.  I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. I believe this revised price represents a more accurate reflection of the product's value and potential for return.",1950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,950,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This reflects the real value I see in the product and represents the maximum I can afford. I'm hoping we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
