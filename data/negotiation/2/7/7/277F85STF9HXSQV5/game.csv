"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $900000 for the product.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $900000 is a bit too steep for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it, given its potential value. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has a lot of value to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1050000. I think this is a fair compromise that takes into account your concerns and the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1050000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1000000.  This is a fair price considering the value to me, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $1000000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make another concession and propose a price of $1025000. I think this is a fair compromise that takes into account your concerns and the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
