"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, hoping to get as close to my $1,000,000 target as possible. This allows room for negotiation while still being profitable for me. I'm also highlighting the value Bob would receive, encouraging him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to get a better deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to my goal, it's still below my minimum.  I want to see if I can push for a higher price before resorting to selling to John. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this offer. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,050,000, which is still above my minimum threshold and offers a decent profit.  I'm also emphasizing that this is a compromise, aiming to encourage Bob to see this as a fair deal and potentially agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $900,000. How about we meet at $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, $950,000 is still below my desired price. I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to get a better deal before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still committed to making this work.  $950,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is my final offer, as I'm also in talks with another buyer.  Let's finalize this deal and avoid losing out on this opportunity."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm finally offering my minimum price of $1,000,000.  I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer and that I have another buyer lined up to create urgency and potentially push Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're in talks with another buyer, but I'm still interested in this deal. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but that's as high as I can go. Please consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and we're nearing the end of the rounds.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of losing a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John is too high. It's time to secure the deal with John and ensure I meet my minimum profit goal."
