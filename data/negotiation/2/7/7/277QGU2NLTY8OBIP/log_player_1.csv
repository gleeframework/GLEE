Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,100,000:** This price is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the benefits for Bob, while also stating my own needs. 

**Reasoning:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Secure a good price:** $1,100,000 is a solid starting point, close to my minimum value.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** I'm not starting at the highest possible price, allowing for potential concessions.
* **Keep John as a backup:** By not immediately accepting a lower price, I keep John's offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reject Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer of $950,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  Accepting it would result in a substantial financial loss.

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining my value:**  Rejecting Bob's offer shows that I'm serious about my minimum price and am not willing to settle for a significantly lower amount.
* **Keeping John as a backup:**  I'm still able to sell to John for a much higher price if I don't reach a mutually agreeable deal with Bob.
* **Potential for negotiation:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer in the next round, potentially reaching a price closer to my desired value."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $950,000 is too far below my minimum. I'm prepared to come down to $1,050,000. This price still allows you to save a significant amount and is much closer to my value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,050,000:**  This price is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. It's still above his perceived value, but a significant concession from my side. 
* **Message:** The message remains friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for both parties. It highlights the ""significant amount"" Bob can still save, making the offer more appealing.

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding a middle ground:**  This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while staying within my desired price range.
* **Building on the previous rejection:**  Rejecting his first offer demonstrated my seriousness, but this counteroffer signals my willingness to find a solution.
* **Keeping the negotiation open:**  By offering a price that's still above Bob's initial offer, I increase the chance that he will accept, avoiding the need to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still looking to save more. I'm willing to pay $975000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reject Bob's Offer:**  While $975,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price than his previous offer, it's still below my desired value. Accepting would mean a significant financial loss.

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining my value:**  Rejecting again shows Bob that I'm serious about earning a price closer to my minimum.
* **Keeping John as a backup:**  I can still sell to John for a significantly higher price if we can't agree. 
* **Potential for a final compromise:**  This rejection gives me the opportunity to make one last counteroffer, potentially reaching a mutually agreeable price.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a final counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum value, while keeping in mind the risk of selling to John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to make this work for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a very fair price for you, considering the value of the product, and it's closer to my minimum.  Let's close this deal - what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,025,000:** This offer is a compromise, bridging the gap between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. It's still significantly above Bob's perceived value but closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Message:** The message remains friendly and emphasizes the ""fairness"" and ""value"" for both parties. It also encourages closing the deal, aiming to push Bob towards accepting.

**Reasoning:**

* **Final attempt at compromise:** This is my last counteroffer before considering selling to John. It shows a genuine willingness to find a solution while maintaining my financial needs.
* **Highlighting the value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to make the price more appealing.
* **Urging closure:** The message emphasizes the need to ""close the deal,"" increasing the pressure for Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I will accept John's offer of $1,200,000 to avoid further negotiation and ensure a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $990000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Sell to John:**  Bob's final offer of $990,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  Accepting would result in a significant financial loss. I've reached the end of my negotiation with Bob, and further rounds are unlikely to produce a better price.

**Reasoning:**

* **Financial loss avoidance:**  Selling to John guarantees a higher price, securing a significantly better outcome than accepting Bob's offer.
* **Ending the negotiation:**  There's no further incentive to continue negotiating with Bob, as he's unlikely to significantly increase his offer. 
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing the negotiation would involve more rounds and require further concessions, which are not worth the potential financial loss.

By selling to John, I ensure the highest possible profit and avoid any further risk of a lower price."
