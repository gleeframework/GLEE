"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I've already given you a lot of concessions. I'm not willing to go any lower than $13000. I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other offers. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,9,
