"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for a product worth much more.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also being optimistic and hoping to close the deal quickly. I'm aware I could get $15,000 from John, but I'm willing to negotiate with Bob first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is more than Bob's perceived value, it's still significantly less than my minimum value. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $10,500? This gives you a good deal, and it's a fair compromise for me.  Let's see if we can close this."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 
 
I'm increasing the price slightly from Bob's offer, but I'm still offering a lower price than my starting offer. I'm aiming for a compromise that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested, but $10,500 is a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $9,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still lower than my minimum. I believe there's room for further negotiation and I'm willing to try and push for a better deal before potentially selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $10,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm sticking to my goal of a compromise, and I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's latest offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping that this counteroffer will lead to a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,500.  Let's finalize this deal and both walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where it's clear Bob is unwilling to budge much further. While I'd prefer to close a deal with Bob, the difference between my minimum price and his offer is becoming too significant.  It's time to cut my losses and move on to John who's offering my minimum price."
