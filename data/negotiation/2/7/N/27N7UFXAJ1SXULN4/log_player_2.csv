"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that might be of interest to you. I'm asking for $95 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  $95 is more than you're willing to pay, and you have room to negotiate.  You can likely get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm eager to sell the product, $85 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference at $90?  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You should reject Alice's offer. While $90 is closer to your target, you can still try to negotiate a lower price. There's still room to split the difference a bit more."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I'm still interested, but $90 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $87.50.  That's a good compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
