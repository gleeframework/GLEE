"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $1,100,000 to $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your offer, $1,150,000 falls short of my minimum expectations. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to stay above $1,200,000 to make this deal work for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I propose a price of $1,250,000.  This reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget constraints. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

I hope this suggestion is acceptable to you.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
