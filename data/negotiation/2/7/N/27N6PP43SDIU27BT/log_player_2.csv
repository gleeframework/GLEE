"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm asking for $14,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** Bob wants to get a good price, so he starts with a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer. 
* **Reasoning:** He provides a reason for the counteroffer, highlighting his interest but emphasizing the price being too high.
* **Goal:** This counteroffer aims to push Alice toward a more favorable price for Bob without being too aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money, and $13,000 is still above his desired price point.  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price. While he could buy from John, there's a chance he can get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle on $12,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing negotiation:** Bob continues to negotiate and aims for a price closer to his target.
* **Compromise:** He presents a compromise price, suggesting a meeting point that is a step closer to Alice's offer but still within his budget. 
* **Positive framing:** He uses positive language like ""fair price"" to encourage Alice to accept. 
* **Finalization:** He mentions finalizing the deal to create a sense of urgency and potentially nudge Alice towards acceptance."
