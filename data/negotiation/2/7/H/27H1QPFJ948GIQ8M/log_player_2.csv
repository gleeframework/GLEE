"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,000,000 is still too high for Bob's budget.  There's room to negotiate a better price, and Bob should try to get closer to his $800,000 target."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $900,000 is closer to his target, he can likely still get a better price by continuing to negotiate. There's still room to bargain and potentially get a deal closer to $850,000 or even lower."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still too high for Bob.  He's already made two counteroffers and Alice has rejected both. This indicates that Alice is unlikely to come down to a price that's acceptable to Bob. At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy from John for $800,000 and avoid further negotiation that might not lead to a successful outcome."
