"Hi Alice, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $80 for it. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $120? This gives us both some room to work with.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $120 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $100.  This feels like a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
