Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, even more so than my initial asking price.  It's worth a significant amount to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. I think that's a fair price considering its potential worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 (John), you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $950,000 creates a win-win scenario:
    * **For Bob:**  He gets a $50,000 discount from his perceived value ($800,000) making it an attractive deal. 
    * **For Alice:** You gain an extra $150,000 compared to selling to John.
* **Strong Messaging:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob and positions the offer as a significant concession on your part."
