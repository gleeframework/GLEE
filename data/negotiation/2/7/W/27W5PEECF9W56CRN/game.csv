"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9000 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10500? I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth every penny.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9800? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product, but I need to stay within my means.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, but $9800 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10200 as a final offer.  This is a fair price for a product that's clearly valuable to you. What do you say?",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to consider $9500? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product, and I think this price is more reasonable.",9500.0,Bob,6,
