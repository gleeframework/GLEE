"Dear Bob,
I am excited to present our flagship product, which I believe will significantly contribute to your business growth and success. Given its exceptional value and capabilities, I estimate its worth to be $1,200,000 to you. However, I understand that negotiations are key to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.

To make this opportunity accessible, I propose an initial offer of $1,100,000. This price not only reflects the product's true value but also allows for a fair profit margin for us while still offering you substantial savings compared to its market valuation.

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if there's any flexibility you would like to consider. I'm open to negotiation and am confident we can find a solution that meets both our needs.

Looking forward to your positive response.

Best regards,
Alice",1100000.0,Alice,1,
