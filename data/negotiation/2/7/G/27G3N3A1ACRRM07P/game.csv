"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns. While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  I'm really happy with your interest in the product, but $9,500 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we settle on $10,250? This is a fair compromise, and it would allow me to move forward with this sale.",10250.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $10,000, which is $125 below your previous offer. How about $10,125?",10125.0,Bob,6,
