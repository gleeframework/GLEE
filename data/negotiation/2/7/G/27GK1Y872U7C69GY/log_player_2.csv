"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm offering the product to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's initial offer is still too high.  It's worth exploring if we can get a better price. We have 10 rounds to negotiate and we can always buy from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  It's a great product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $950,000. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it represents fair value for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to spend closer to $950,000, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,050,000 for the product. I'm willing to make a concession, but I need to ensure I'm fairly compensated for the value I'm bringing to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down a bit, but it's still too high. We're within striking distance of our target price, and it's worth pushing for a lower price. There's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit higher than where I want to be, but let's try $1,000,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal quickly. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $1,050,000 for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000, but that's as low as I can go. I hope we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we're close to our goal price, Alice is still pushing for a higher price than what we're willing to pay.  We're only a few rounds in, but it's looking like we're going to be stuck in a stalemate. It's better to cut our losses and buy from John for a price we're comfortable with."
