I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum acceptable price but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium.  

Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

$8,000 is far too low for me.  I'm not willing to sell for that price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm coming down to $17,000, which is still well above my minimum price of $15,000.  This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth.  I'd rather sell to John for $15,000 and guarantee myself a good deal.  It's time to move on from Bob."
