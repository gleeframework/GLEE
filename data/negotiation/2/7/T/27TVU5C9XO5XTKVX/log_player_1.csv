{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($120) to see if he's willing to pay a premium. It's a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $115? I'm confident this product will be worth it for you."", ""product_price"": 115}
