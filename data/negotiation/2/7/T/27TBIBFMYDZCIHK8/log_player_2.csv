"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth trying to negotiate a better price. There's no downside to rejecting the initial offer, as you can always buy from John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer that's 10% lower than Alice's initial price is a reasonable starting point. It signals that you're serious about buying the product but are also looking for a better deal.  This will hopefully spark a negotiation without being too aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down $50,000 from her initial offer. While it's not the absolute best price, it's a good compromise.  Continuing to negotiate risks reaching a stalemate or Alice getting even more stubborn.  Buying from Alice for $1,150,000 saves you $50,000 compared to John."
