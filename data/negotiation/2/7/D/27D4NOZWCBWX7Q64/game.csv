"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, so how about $1,250,000? This price still represents a significant value to you and allows me to get closer to my desired price point. Let's find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,150,000 and $1,250,000, so how about $1,200,000? That's the sweet spot for me.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
