Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in the product, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I'm afraid $800000 is a bit below the minimum price I'm willing to consider. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1200000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?
