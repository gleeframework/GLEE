"I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is still significantly lower than the product's value.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value you'll receive. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. Can you consider this price?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, which reflects both the product's value and the fact that I'm trying to be reasonable.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. This is a great product, and I think you'll be glad you invested in it.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there yet. The product is truly valuable, and I'm confident you'll see the return on your investment. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to go down to $11,200.  This price reflects the product's value and my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.  What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,7,

"I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,200 and my previous offer. Can you consider $10,900?",10900.0,Bob,8,
