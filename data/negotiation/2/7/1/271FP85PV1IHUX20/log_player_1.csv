Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,300,000 is a bit too steep for me right now.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. This price reflects the product's value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. This product offers immense value, and I'm confident it will bring you a substantial return. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the true worth of what I'm offering."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly willing to pay over $1,000,000 for the product. We're getting closer to a price point where I maximize profit while ensuring Bob still feels like he's getting a good deal. I'm not willing to settle for anything less than $1,150,000 at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to move on the price.  To be completely transparent, I'm aiming for something closer to $1,200,000. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,150,000? It's a strong offer that reflects the product's value while recognizing your investment."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire to get closer to $1,200,000, but $1,150,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $1,125,000. This is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this and move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is consistently increasing his offer, and we're now at $1,125,000.  While I'd ideally like to get closer to $1,200,000, there's a risk he might significantly decrease his offer in the next round. Accepting this offer guarantees a substantial profit and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
