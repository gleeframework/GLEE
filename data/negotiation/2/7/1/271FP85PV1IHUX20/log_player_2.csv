Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,300,000 is a bit too steep for me right now.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. This price reflects the product's value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

Round 3

# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. This product offers immense value, and I'm confident it will bring you a substantial return. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the true worth of what I'm offering.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
