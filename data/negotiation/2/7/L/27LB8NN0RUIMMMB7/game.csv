"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal for both of us, considering it's worth $1,200,000 to me and $1,000,000 to you. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate your flexibility, $1,100,000 is still a bit outside of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This still leaves some room for profit for me, and it's a fair price given the value of the product.  What do you say?",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  However, I'm still not quite there.  $1,025,000 is the absolute highest I can go.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
