"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest. While $200 might have been a bit high, I can't go as low as $120.  Could you meet me halfway at $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a little more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and go with $140?  It's a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Bob,4,
