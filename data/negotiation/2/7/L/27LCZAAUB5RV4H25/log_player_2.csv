Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest. While $200 might have been a bit high, I can't go as low as $120.  Could you meet me halfway at $160?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a little more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and go with $140?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140}
