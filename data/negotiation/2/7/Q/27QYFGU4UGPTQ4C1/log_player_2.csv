"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. I'm confident we can reach a deal that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  It's above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  You have 10 rounds to try and get a better price, so it's worth exploring counteroffers. 
* **Buying from John is always an option:**  You can still buy from John for $1,200,000 if the negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the fact that I'm a serious buyer."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $1,250,000?  I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth and our time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your budget:** While it's closer, $1,250,000 is still $50,000 over your maximum.
* **You have room to negotiate:** You have 7 rounds left, which is enough time to try and get a better price.
* **Buying from John is a safe alternative:** If the negotiation fails, you can still secure the product from John for your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the value, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,250,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This shows my genuine interest in buying the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still not enough for me. Given the product's value and my time invested in this negotiation, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's settle on $1,200,000. This price is fair, and I believe it allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is at your maximum budget:**  $1,200,000 is the highest price you're willing to pay.
* **You have no room for further negotiation:**  Rejecting this offer means either making another counteroffer (which Alice may reject) or going to John.
* **Buying from John gives the same price:** There's no advantage to buying from John at this point. 

You've successfully negotiated a price within your budget."
