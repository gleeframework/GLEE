"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial price. Would you consider $825,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $775,000 is still significantly lower than the value of this product to you.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $800,000? This would ensure both of us get a fair deal.  What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
