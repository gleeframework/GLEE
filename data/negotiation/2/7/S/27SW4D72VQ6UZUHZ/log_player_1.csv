{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you'll get a fantastic product at a fair price, and I'll be able to make a good profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price, but it's also below Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.  I'll be prepared to adjust the price based on Bob's response, but I'll also keep John's offer of $8,000 in mind as a fallback."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming for a compromise. There's still room for me to make a profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,500 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $9,250. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,250 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,750. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,750 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm happy to accept this offer to ensure a sale. There's a chance that Bob might not accept a counteroffer, and I'm not willing to risk losing the deal completely."
