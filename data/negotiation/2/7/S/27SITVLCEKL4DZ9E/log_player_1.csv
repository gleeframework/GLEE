Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This is a relatively high offer, giving Bob a good deal if he values the product higher than $15,000. However, it still leaves room for me to make a profit if he rejects the offer, as I can then sell it to John for $12,000. This strategy balances the risk of losing the sale with the potential for maximizing my profits."
