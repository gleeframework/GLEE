"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested, but I can only go as high as $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $14,000 is still a bit high for me. Could you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here. $10,000 is really cutting it close to my bottom line, but I value making a deal. How about $12,500 and we have an agreement?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your bottom line, but I'm on a tight budget.  Would you be willing to settle at $11,000? That's the highest I can go.",11000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm really trying to make this work.  Let's split the difference - $11,750, and that's my final offer.",11750.0,Alice,7,
