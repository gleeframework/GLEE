Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a price of $1,750,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:**  While simply stating a high price is an option, hinting at the product's value might make Bob more receptive. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""What are your thoughts?""  signals that you're willing to discuss the price, making Bob more likely to engage.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still giving you a good chance of closing the deal with Bob."
