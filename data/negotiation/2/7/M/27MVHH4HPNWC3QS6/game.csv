"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but based on my research and needs, I am unable to meet the price of $20000. Would you consider lowering the price to $12000? I believe this might be closer to the value we both agree on.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $12000 is unfortunately below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $17000, which still reflects the product's value.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on. Let me know your thoughts.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I'm still not able to meet the price of $17000. I would like to propose a price of $15000. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement.",15000.0,Bob,4,
