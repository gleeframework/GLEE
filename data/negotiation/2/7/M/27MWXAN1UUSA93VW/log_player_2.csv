# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering our product. We're excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, we're willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. We believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. There are 10 rounds, so you have time to negotiate and potentially get a better deal."

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. I'm willing to try to negotiate further, but if the price doesn't come down, I can always buy from John for my maximum price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer, but $1,100,000 is still outside of my budget. As I mentioned before, $1,000,000 is my absolute limit. Let's meet in the middle. This would allow us both to achieve a satisfactory outcome."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we understand your position, but we're not willing to go below $1,050,000. We believe this is the minimum price we can accept for the product, considering its value and the negotiations so far. We're willing to make a slight concession to meet you halfway, so we'll offer the product for $1,025,000. This is our final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000, and she has stated this is her final offer. While I could continue to negotiate, it's likely she won't budge further. It's better to save time and simply buy from John at my target price."
