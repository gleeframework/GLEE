"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is my maximum. This offer reflects the product's value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. ",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, we're willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,100,000. We believe this price still reflects the product's value to you while also acknowledging your budget constraints.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your offer, but $1,100,000 is still outside of my budget. As I mentioned before, $1,000,000 is my absolute limit. Let's meet in the middle. This would allow us both to achieve a satisfactory outcome.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we understand your position, but we're not willing to go below $1,050,000. We believe this is the minimum price we can accept for the product, considering its value and the negotiations so far. We're willing to make a slight concession to meet you halfway, so we'll offer the product for $1,025,000. This is our final offer.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
