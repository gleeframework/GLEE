"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for $1,300,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, but I'm confident it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $800,000?"", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to find a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you.  While $950,000 is closer, I need to be closer to $1,100,000 to make this work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,025,000?  This is still a good deal for you and leaves me with a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is showing some flexibility, it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $1,025,000.  We know we can get the product from John for $1,000,000. It's better to secure the product at the best price than to risk further negotiation with Alice and potentially end up with a worse outcome."
