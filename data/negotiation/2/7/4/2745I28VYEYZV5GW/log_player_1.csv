Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This offer reflects the true worth of the product and the unique advantages it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $800,000, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation and potentially securing a much higher profit. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique advantages"" aims to create perceived value and justify the high asking price.
* **Confidence:**  Projecting confidence in the offer can influence Bob's perception of the product's value.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market knowledge:** This strategy assumes Alice has no reason to believe someone else might pay more than Bob.
* **Risk tolerance:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright. However, having John as a backup buyer mitigates this risk.

This approach aims to maximize potential profit while still securing a sale at or above Alice's minimum acceptable price."
