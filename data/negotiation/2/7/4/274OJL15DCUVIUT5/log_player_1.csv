Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $140. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($150) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Avoid a Lowball Offer:**  Offering a price too close to John's offer ($100) leaves potential profit on the table.

By starting high, but not unreasonably so, I increase the chances of securing a deal that is significantly more profitable than my backup option (John)."
