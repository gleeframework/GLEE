Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000. Let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, you can afford to start with a high offer. This leaves room for negotiation and increases the potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message implies the product's value might be even higher elsewhere (""before I list it publicly""). This creates a sense of urgency and potential exclusivity for Bob. 
* **Anchor Price:** By starting at $18,000, you anchor Bob's perception of the price. Even if he negotiates down, it's more likely he'll be willing to pay a higher amount than if you started at a lower price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob to be particularly price-sensitive, you might adjust your starting offer slightly lower. 
* **Negotiation Skills:** Be prepared to negotiate. Bob might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide how low you're willing to go. Remember, your minimum is essentially $10,000."
