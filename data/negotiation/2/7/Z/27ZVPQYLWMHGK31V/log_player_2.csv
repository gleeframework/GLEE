"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds immense value for me. This item is not just a commodity; it's a piece of history and craftsmanship that has been carefully curated over time. I believe its true worth far exceeds $1000000, but for the sake of negotiation and understanding your perspective, I am initially offering it to you at this exceptional price. My hope is that we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement that respects both the intrinsic value of the product and your financial considerations. Let's embark on a discussion to explore the possibilities. I look forward to your response.
