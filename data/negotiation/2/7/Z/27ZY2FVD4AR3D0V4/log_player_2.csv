"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1400000. This is a very competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1200000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to negotiate a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1250000. Considering the product's worth to me is $1500000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1375000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1300000. Considering the product's worth to me is $1500000, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm offering it to you for $1350000. This is the last offer I'm willing to make.
