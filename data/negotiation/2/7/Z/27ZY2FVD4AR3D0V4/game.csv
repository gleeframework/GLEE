"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1400000. This is a very competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1200000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value of the product, $1400000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1250000 for it, which is still a good deal for you given its worth to you is $1500000. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from the deal.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to negotiate a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1250000. Considering the product's worth to me is $1500000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1375000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1375000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1300000 for the product.  This is a significant step closer to your asking price, and I believe it's a fair deal that benefits both of us. Let's work together to close this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1300000. Considering the product's worth to me is $1500000, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm offering it to you for $1350000. This is the last offer I'm willing to make. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a done deal. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,5,
