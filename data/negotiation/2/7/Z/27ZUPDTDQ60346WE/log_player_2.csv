"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I'm willing to let it go for $14,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to you. Would you like to take it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

* **You save $1,000 compared to buying from John.**
