{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $125. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than my minimum value of $100, but still leaves room for potential negotiation. This leaves space for Bob to counteroffer and potentially reach a price that works for both of us. I'm confident that I can still get a better price than John's offer of $100 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $125 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is close to my minimum but I am confident that I can get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer to try and meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $110 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $117.50?"", ""product_price"": 117.50} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $115 is very close to my desired price and is above my minimum threshold of $100.  It's worth taking this deal rather than risking further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
