"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round. I think the product is worth more than $1,100,000 to me, so I'd like to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. Here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $900,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial offer already represents a considerable discount.  Could you meet me halfway at $1,000,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to compromise. Meeting Alice halfway at $1,000,000 is a good starting point, but I'd like to try to get an even better deal. I'll reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make another counteroffer to Alice. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which is a bit above the middle ground, but still a good deal for me.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $975,000. This is a very competitive offer considering the product's potential to bring you a $1,200,000 value.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

Round 6
