,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,800? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $9,800 is closer, I can't go that low.  I'm willing to meet you at $10,200. This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know if you're interested.",10200.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,900? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make a final offer. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000.",9900.0,Bob,6,
