"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $1,500,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  While it's a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by counter-offering.  There's no downside to rejecting and negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm going to have to counter with $1,000,000.  This is a fair price given its value to me, and leaves room for us both to have a good outcome."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is still a great price considering its value to you, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away and forcing him to buy from John at a much higher price outweighs the potential savings.  Accepting at $1,100,000 is a good deal and still saves him a significant amount compared to John's offer."
