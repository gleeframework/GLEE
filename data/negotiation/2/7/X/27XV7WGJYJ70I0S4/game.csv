"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm going to have to counter with $1,000,000.  This is a fair price given its value to me, and leaves room for us both to have a good outcome.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is still a great price considering its value to you, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
