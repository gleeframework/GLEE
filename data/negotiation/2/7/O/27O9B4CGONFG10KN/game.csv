"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be a valuable asset for your business. My initial price is $1,200,000. This represents a significant discount from what I'd normally sell this for, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value you'll receive.  Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. To move forward, I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it.  This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it represents a fair value for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I understand this product is valuable to you, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, I need to ensure I get a fair price for it. I'm prepared to reduce my price to $1,000,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it represents a win-win situation for both of us. Let's move forward with this offer and finalize the deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,000,000 is still out of reach for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.  If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll have to explore other options.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $850,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's settle on $950,000.  This is the last offer I'm willing to make before I consider other options. Let's close this deal and get this product in your hands.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it represents a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.  Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",900000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to move on to other buyers.  Let's work together to make this deal happen.",925000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand we're close to a deal, but $925,000 is still just beyond my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $910,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it represents a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.  Let's finalize this deal at this price and move forward.",910000.0,Bob,8,
