{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be a valuable asset for your business. My initial price is $1,200,000.

Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. To move forward, I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it.  This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it represents a fair value for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low. While I'd like to close the deal, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I understand this product is valuable to you, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, I need to ensure I get a fair price for it. I'm prepared to reduce my price to $1,000,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it represents a win-win situation for both of us. Let's move forward with this offer and finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1,000,000 is still out of reach for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.  If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to accept anything less than $1,000,000 at this point. I'll counteroffer again, but if he doesn't budge, I'm going to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $850,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's settle on $950,000.  This is the last offer I'm willing to make before I consider other options. Let's close this deal and get this product in your hands."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it represents a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.  Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not happy with it. I'm going to counteroffer once more, but if Bob doesn't come up, I'm going to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to move on to other buyers.  Let's work together to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 925000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand we're close to a deal, but $925,000 is still just beyond my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $910,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it represents a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.  Let's finalize this deal at this price and move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting close to the deadline and Bob's offer, while better, is still significantly less than what I'd like.  With only a few rounds left, it's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. It's a much better outcome for me."
