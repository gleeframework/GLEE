"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer.  It makes sense to negotiate down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  However,  $12,000 is quite high. I'm interested, but I'd only be willing to pay around $6,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($6,000) than my actual maximum ($8,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Alice's flexibility. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting low, I'm trying to ""anchor"" the negotiation closer to my desired price range. 
* **Leaving Room for John:** If Alice completely rejects my offer, I still have the option of going with John's $8,000 offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $9,000. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice came down significantly, $9,000 is still above your $8,000 maximum and John's offer.
* **Room to Negotiate:** Her language (""best price,"" ""fair compromise"") suggests she might be willing to go a little lower. 

You'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further, aiming for a price closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down. $9,000 is closer, but it's still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $7,500?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This offer splits the difference between her current offer ($9,000) and my previous offer ($6,000). 
* **Strategic Positioning:** $7,500 is a strong position:
    * It's still below my $8,000 maximum.
    * It gives Alice room to come down slightly and still feel like she's getting a better deal than John's $8,000 offer. 
* **Time Constraint (Implied):** I haven't explicitly mentioned John, but by staying firm, I'm implying I have other options if we can't reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'll counteroffer at $8,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer.
* **Above Budget:** $8,500 is still above your $8,000 maximum.
* **John's Offer:** You have a guaranteed offer from John for $8,000.

There's no point in negotiating further with Alice if she won't budge from $8,500. It's time to cut your losses and secure the product at the best possible price from John."
