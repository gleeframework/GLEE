"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $150.",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $150 is definitely a good price, I'm not quite ready to go that low just yet.  How about we meet in the middle at $175? I believe this price still represents a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $175 is a bit too high. I'd be willing to meet you at $155, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",155.0,Bob,4,
