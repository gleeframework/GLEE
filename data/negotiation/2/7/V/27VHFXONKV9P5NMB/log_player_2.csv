{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, but it's closer to your desired price range.  However, you're still within your budget and have the option to buy from John.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from your previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to meet Alice halfway.  It's still well within your budget, and it's close enough to Alice's last offer that it might encourage her to accept. If she rejects again, you'll have to seriously consider buying from John, as you're approaching the price point where the risk of further negotiation isn't worth the potential savings."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,212,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**
