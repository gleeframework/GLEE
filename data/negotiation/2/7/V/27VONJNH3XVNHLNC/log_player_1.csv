Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. I believe it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm happy to start the negotiation with a price of $900,000. This leaves room for us both to find a mutually agreeable solution. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, given its value to me. This represents a significant discount from your initial offer and leaves room for a win-win scenario.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better price. While it's tempting to sell to John for $800,000, I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  This price acknowledges your value for the product while allowing me to achieve a fair return.  Let's work towards a successful deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
