"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. I believe it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm happy to start the negotiation with a price of $900,000. This leaves room for us both to find a mutually agreeable solution. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, given its value to me. This represents a significant discount from your initial offer and leaves room for a win-win scenario.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  This price acknowledges your value for the product while allowing me to achieve a fair return.  Let's work towards a successful deal.",875000.0,Alice,3,
