Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $11000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $11,000 is below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer, but $11,000 isn't quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $12,500?  That's still a good deal for a product worth this much, and it gives us both some room to compromise."", ""product_price"": 12500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While I'm getting closer to my goal, $11,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer again to see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $12,125 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value and the concessions we've both made. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to go up to $11900, but no higher. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,900

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm starting to run out of time and John's offer guarantees me my minimum acceptable price.  It's not ideal, but it's the most sensible choice at this point."
