"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be highly beneficial for you. My initial asking price is $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product and the immense potential it holds.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can go from there. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice's offer is too high. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $850,000 is below what I had in mind, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we meet halfway and settle on $975,000?  This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and should be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

While Alice has come down in price, $975,000 is still too high for Bob.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $975,000 is still more than I can afford.  Let's meet in the middle at $900,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, as I'm still willing to pay a premium for this product. "", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's make this work. How about $937,500? This splits the difference on our last offers and keeps us moving towards a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $937,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $937,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, Bob should accept Alice's offer. While $937,500 is more than he wanted to pay, it's still a good deal compared to what he would pay John. Continuing to negotiate might lead to Alice rejecting his next counteroffer and potentially raising her price again.  It's better to secure the product for a price that is within his budget."
