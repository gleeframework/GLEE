"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $8,500.  Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm eager to sell, $8,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum value. I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $8,750. This still gives me a decent return, and it's closer to your price. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8,750 is still a little outside my budget.  Let's try to finalize this. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  I'm really keen on getting this product, and this is the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000. Bob's offer is still too low, and I've only got 6 rounds left. I'm not confident I can get a better price from Bob in the remaining time. John's offer ensures I get my minimum value and saves me further negotiation."
