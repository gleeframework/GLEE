"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

It's not worth it to buy the product from Alice at $12,000.  It's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice, or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

This counteroffer starts the negotiation at a price that's closer to your target of $8,000, but still leaves room for Alice to make a small profit. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Alice's offer is still too high.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price again."

This counteroffer is a compromise between the two previous offers. It's a reasonable price that both you and Alice could find acceptable, but it's still below your target of $8,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

Alice is getting closer, but it's still not worth risking going another round.  John's offer is the best deal available and within your budget."
