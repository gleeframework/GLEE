"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value and potential for your business. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we meet halfway at $975,000?",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $900,000 is close, but to be frank, I can't let this product go for less than $950,000. I'm confident this will be a worthwhile investment for you, even at this price.",950000.0,Alice,5,
