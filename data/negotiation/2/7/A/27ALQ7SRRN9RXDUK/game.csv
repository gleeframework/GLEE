"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $60 is a bit too low for me. I understand it's not my initial price, but  I'm willing to come down to $90. That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $85. This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth it. What do you say?",85.0,Alice,5,
