# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You can get the same product from John for $1,200,000, so you have some room to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price.  How about $1,180,000?  This represents a good compromise and allows us both to benefit from the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,180,000

Alice's offer of $1,180,000 is a good compromise, and you can save $20,000 compared to buying from John."
