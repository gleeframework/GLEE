"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $90. Would you consider that?",90.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, but $90 is still a bit more than I'm hoping to spend. How about $75?",75.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $85. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product.",85.0,Alice,5,
