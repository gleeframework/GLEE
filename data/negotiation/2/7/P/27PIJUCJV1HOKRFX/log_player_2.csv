"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800,000. I'm willing to listen to your thoughts and work together to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's value to her ($800,000 vs. $1,200,000). This suggests she is willing to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's a bit lower than I'm looking for. Given the value of this product, I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us and allows us to move forward with the deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to part with the product for $1,000,000. Considering the value it holds, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $950,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a good starting point for further discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there is still room for negotiation. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price. There's a good chance Alice will continue to budge given her initial offer was so low and her willingness to meet Bob halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $950,000 is closer, I'm still looking to get a better deal.  Let's split the difference - I'm offering $975,000. This feels like a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still allowing us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get a better deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go above $950,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $972,500. This is a compromise that takes into account your desire to split the difference, but still reflects the product's true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $972,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $972,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price. While it's still not the ideal price, the gap is narrowing. Accepting the offer at $972,500 is a good deal considering:

* Bob is saving $227,500 compared to buying from John.
*  Further negotiation could take more time and might not lead to a significantly lower price. 

It's a good compromise, and Bob should secure this deal."
