Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I believe it's a fantastic deal and would be very useful for you."", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing you have John as a backup buyer at $120.
* **High Starting Point:** Starting with $119 aims to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the price is high, it leaves a slight possibility for Bob to negotiate (though unlikely given his valuation of $80).
* **Backup Buyer Security:** If Bob rejects the offer, you can sell to John without any loss. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or willingness to pay more than his perceived value."
