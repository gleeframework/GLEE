"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to make this deal work. It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make this happen.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $700,000? It's a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 simply doesn't work for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $775,000 for the product. It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",775000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate the movement. How about we settle at $725,000? I think that's a reasonable offer considering the market value and our negotiations.",725000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm feeling generous and want to close this deal.  I'm willing to drop my price to $750,000. That's a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen.",750000.0,Alice,7,
