"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. We believe it could greatly benefit your business operations.

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is a fair price given the value it brings me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Given the value you place on the product and your willingness to pay $800,000, I am willing to consider a price closer to your offer. Therefore, I propose a price of $875,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering the benefits it will bring to your business.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $875,000 is closer, I'm still not able to go that high. I'm sticking with my offer of $800,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this now.",800000.0,Bob,4,
