"I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob. I can see that you're willing to pay $130, but I was thinking more along the lines of $160. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $145?",145.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product and would be willing to go up to $138. ",138.0,Bob,6,
