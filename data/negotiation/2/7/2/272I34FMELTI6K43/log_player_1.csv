Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $12,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I still believe that $12,000 is a fair price for the product considering my budget constraints. Would you be willing to consider this amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob is clearly unwilling to budge beyond his budget, and while further counteroffers are possible, they are unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome. Accepting his offer of $12,000 is the same as selling to John. Therefore, it makes the most sense to move on to John and avoid further negotiation."
