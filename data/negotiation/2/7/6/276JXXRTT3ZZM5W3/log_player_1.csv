Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

This is a strong starting offer, leaving some room for negotiation.  It's above your minimum but still attractive to Bob since he values the product at $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

It's too early to accept Bob's low offer. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
``` 

This counteroffer is still above Bob's offer, but it shows a willingness to compromise while still securing a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely. It's better to accept his offer and secure the sale than to keep negotiating and potentially end up with nothing."
