"Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for $1,000,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm happy to accept $950,000. This leaves us both with a good profit, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking $920,000 is a bit closer to what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $930,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product's value to me.",930000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to compromise, but $930,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle again? I'm happy to come down to $940,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while ensuring both of us can walk away satisfied.",940000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $940,000. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, and I'll also throw in a small bonus of $5,000 to sweeten the deal. This way, you'll still get a good price, and I'll get a product that's worth $800,000 to you. I believe this is a fair compromise.",920000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's try to reach a final agreement.  I'm prepared to accept $935,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and our remaining time.  It's a win-win for both of us.",935000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $935,000. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, and I'll throw in an additional $2,000 bonus to sweeten the deal. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a commitment to move forward with the purchase.",925000.0,Bob,8,
