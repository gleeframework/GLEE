{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,500.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $12,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $8,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming for a price around $10,500 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($12,000 - $8,000 = $4,000) while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain.

**Why this strategy:**

* **Strong Opening:** It positions the product as having premium value by starting higher than Bob's perceived gain.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial price is high, it leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, making him feel like he's getting a better deal.
* **Backup Plan:** You have the security of John's offer, ensuring you won't go below your minimum."
