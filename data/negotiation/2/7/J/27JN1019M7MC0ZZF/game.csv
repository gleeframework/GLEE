"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $145. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",145.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $145 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $160? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to make a profit, but $160 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $150?",150.0,Bob,4,
