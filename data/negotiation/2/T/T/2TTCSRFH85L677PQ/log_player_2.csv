"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,800,000 is above his maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price before resorting to John."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1500000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1700000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.
