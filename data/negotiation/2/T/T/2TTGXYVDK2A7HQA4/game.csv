"Bob, I believe this product has immense value, and I'm confident it can be a game-changer for you. I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000.  This is a significant opportunity, and I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product is valuable, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below what this product is worth. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This represents a considerable discount for you, and it still allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,300,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit lower. How about $1,175,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,175,000.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, my budget is closer to $1,200,000. If you're able to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm ready to finalize this deal. I'm willing to accept $1,225,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, and it's a price that reflects the true value of this product.  Let's close this deal.",1225000.0,Alice,7,
