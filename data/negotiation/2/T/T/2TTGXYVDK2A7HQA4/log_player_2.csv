Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below what this product is worth. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This represents a considerable discount for you, and it still allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Alice has signaled this is her final offer, and the price of $1,225,000 is a reasonable compromise.  Continuing to negotiate might frustrate Alice and risk losing the deal. This price also provides significant savings compared to John's offer."
