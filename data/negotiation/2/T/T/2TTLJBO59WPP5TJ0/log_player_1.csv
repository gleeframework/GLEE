Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's below your minimum desired price of $15,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. This offer also acknowledges Bob's perceived value of the product and allows for a potential win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than your minimum desired price of $15,000.  Rejecting his offer gives you a chance to negotiate further and hopefully get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $9,500 is closer to your desired price, it's still below your minimum.  The negotiations with Bob are getting a bit tedious, and you're getting closer to your desired price with John.  Selling to John ensures you get the best possible price and avoids further negotiation."
