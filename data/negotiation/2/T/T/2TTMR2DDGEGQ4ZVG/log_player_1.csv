Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to capitalize on Bob's potential interest.  Since I don't know his value, I'm leaving room for negotiation. If he rejects, I can always lower the price or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $15,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a slightly lower price, aiming for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm countering with $13,500. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate and meet him halfway. I believe this price is fair, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not sure if I can get a higher price from him.  Furthermore, continuing to negotiate might risk losing him as a buyer, potentially leaving me with only John's offer of $10,000. It's better to secure the sale at this price than risk a lower outcome."
