Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and my offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential $500,000 profit margin to negotiate within.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob finds the deal attractive enough to accept.  Offering a price slightly below his perceived value increases the likelihood of a quick sale.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:**  The phrase ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a touch of desirability.
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob (""someone like you"") reinforces his potential gain.
* **Strong Price Point:**  $1,250,000 gives Bob a significant discount ($250,000) while securing you a $250,000 profit above your minimum.
* **Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" encourages a prompt decision."
