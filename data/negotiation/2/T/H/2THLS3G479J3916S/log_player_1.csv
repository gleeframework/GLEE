Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is still a good price for you given your value of $12,000. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than nothing, I can likely get a better price. I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $9,000. It's a good deal for both of us and it's getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate and potentially having Bob walk away."
