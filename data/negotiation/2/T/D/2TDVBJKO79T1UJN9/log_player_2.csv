"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can potentially get the product for a lower price by negotiating with Alice.  Since your maximum budget is $1,500,000, you have room to make a counteroffer and potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a good deal.  This offer is a 16.67% discount from Alice's initial price.  While this is a bold move, it demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and could potentially lead to a faster agreement.  If Alice rejects, I will adjust my offer based on her response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my target price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Alice to see if I can get a better deal. There's still room for me to make another counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $1,050,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to negotiate a price closer to my ideal. This is a compromise, and it could be a more palatable offer for Alice, increasing the likelihood of a successful deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is closer to my target price than John's offer of $1,500,000.  While I could continue negotiating with Alice, there's a risk she'll reject my next counteroffer, forcing me to buy from John at a higher price.  It's better to secure this price, as it's a good deal for me and avoids further negotiation."
