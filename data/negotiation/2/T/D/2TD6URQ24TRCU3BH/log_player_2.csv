"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There's a good chance Alice will be willing to come down in price since she values the product at $1,000,000."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given the value you place on it, I'd like to propose a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair offer that allows for both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While $1,200,000 is certainly appealing, I believe the product's inherent value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly and propose a price of $1,275,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and ensures a win-win situation for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price range, it's still above your target.  You should continue negotiating to see if you can secure a price closer to your $1,200,000 counteroffer. There's still room for both parties to find a mutually beneficial price."
