"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given the value you place on it, I'd like to propose a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair offer that allows for both of us to walk away happy.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While $1,200,000 is certainly appealing, I believe the product's inherent value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly and propose a price of $1,275,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and ensures a win-win situation for both of us.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. While I value the product, $1,275,000 is still slightly more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm ready to move forward at $1,250,000. This offer reflects the product's value while allowing for a smooth transaction.  I'm confident we can find a compromise that benefits us both.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
