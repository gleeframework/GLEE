Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given the value you place on it, I'd like to propose a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair offer that allows for both of us to walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and ensures a win-win situation for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1275000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. While I value the product, $1,275,000 is still slightly more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm ready to move forward at $1,250,000. This offer reflects the product's value while allowing for a smooth transaction.  I'm confident we can find a compromise that benefits us both.
