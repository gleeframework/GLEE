"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, $11,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm  firmly set on $10,000.  This is a fair price that's beneficial for both of us, considering your value and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're firm on $10,000, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $10,800. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering its worth $15,000 to me. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",10800.0,Alice,5,
