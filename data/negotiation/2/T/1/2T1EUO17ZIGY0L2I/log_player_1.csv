"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value"" and ""potential"" to justify the high initial price.
* **Alternative:** I'm keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob aren't fruitful."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum and his own perceived value of the product. Accepting would be a substantial loss. It's clear we have room to negotiate, and I'm willing to counter to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective on the price, the value of this product is undeniable. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair offer, reflecting the true worth of what's being offered."", 
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession from my initial offer, moving down by $300,000. This shows Bob that I am willing to negotiate. 
* **Holding Firm:**  However, I am still aiming high above both my minimum and his offer. My goal is to find a middle ground, but not settle for a price that undervalues the product.
* **Justification:** The message reinforces the product's value to justify the relatively high price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While the product is good, $1,700,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is slowly increasing, but it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I need to hold firm and signal that I'm willing to walk away if necessary. I'll continue negotiating, but selling to John remains a strong alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find the right price, and I respect that. However, this product represents a significant investment on my end, and I need to ensure a fair return. I'm willing to consider $1,550,000. This is a very competitive offer considering its true value and potential."", 
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Approaching the Limit:** I'm dropping my price to be just slightly above my absolute minimum of $1,500,000. This signals to Bob that I'm serious about selling, but not willing to go much lower. 
* **Justify the Value:**  I continue to emphasize the product's value to justify the price, hoping to convince Bob to stretch his budget.
* **Pressure Point:**  This counteroffer puts the pressure on Bob, as I'm very close to my alternative option (selling to John). It gives him a final chance to secure the product at a price below my initial offer, but still profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we seem to be getting closer.  $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Bob has reached his perceived value of the product ($1,200,000), and it's still below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). 
* **Unlikely to Improve:**  It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge this gap significantly. Bob has shown his hand.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John offers a guaranteed sale at my desired price. It's time to cut my losses with Bob and move on to a sure thing."
