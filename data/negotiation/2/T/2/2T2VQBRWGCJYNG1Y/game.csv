"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and it would allow me to save some money. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to come down a bit further, however.  Let's split the difference. I'll accept $950,000 for the product. This offer reflects the value and potential of this unique opportunity.  What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that we're getting close, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $925,000 is a more reasonable price. It's a compromise that I think we can both live with. What do you think?",925000.0,Bob,4,
