"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $18,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable investment.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm highlighting the potential benefits for Bob (""great deal"", ""valuable investment"") to make the offer more appealing.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to respond and start the negotiation process.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** Starting high gives me the most leverage to negotiate down.
* **Encourage Bob to engage:** A positive and open approach makes Bob more likely to participate in the negotiation. 
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** His response will give me information about his willingness to pay and help me decide how to proceed in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. I'll likely counter with a price somewhere between $12,000 and $18,000,  trying to find a compromise that's mutually beneficial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of this product.  Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $18,000 to $16,000, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Reiterate value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to emphasize the value of my offer.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone to keep the negotiation productive.

This strategy aims to:

* **Find a middle ground:** By lowering my price, I'm making the deal more attractive to Bob while still staying within my minimum acceptable range.
* **Signal a willingness to compromise:** This shows Bob that I'm serious about finding a deal.
* **Maintain leverage:** By not accepting his offer immediately, I retain some leverage to potentially negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $16,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $14,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $14,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hesitant to accept it.  I believe I can potentially get a slightly higher price, especially considering that I have the option to sell to John for $15,000.  By rejecting Bob's offer and counteroffering, I can try to secure a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $14,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. How about we split the difference and go with $15,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Highlight compromise:** I acknowledge Bob's offer and emphasize my willingness to meet halfway.
* **Offer a specific price:** I propose a concrete price ($15,000) which is my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasize fairness:** I frame the price as fair for both of us, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Call for action:** I encourage Bob to finalize the deal, showing my commitment to reaching an agreement.

This strategy aims to:

* **Reach a win-win situation:** By offering a middle ground, I'm aiming for a deal that satisfies both parties.
* **Minimize further negotiations:**  Offering my minimum price should reduce the likelihood of further back and forth.
* **Leverage John's offer:**  By stating my willingness to accept $15,000, I subtly remind Bob of my alternative option, adding a bit of pressure to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $15,000, but I'm willing to meet you at $13,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $13,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm running out of time and rounds. It's getting increasingly unlikely that we'll reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 

Given that I have a guaranteed sale to John for $15,000, it's in my best interest to stop negotiating with Bob and sell the product to John. This ensures I get my minimum desired price and avoids the risk of further negotiations that might not be successful."
