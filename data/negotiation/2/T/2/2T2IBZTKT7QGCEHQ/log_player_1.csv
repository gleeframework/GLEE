Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($100) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $95 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price.
* **Ensure a Sale:** Offering it for $95 makes it highly likely Bob will buy, as it's a significant discount from his perceived value, guaranteeing you a profit above your minimum."
