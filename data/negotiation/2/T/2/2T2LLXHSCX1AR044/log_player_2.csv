Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $10,200. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation when you have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $10,000."
