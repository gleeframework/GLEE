"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $15,000, to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm happy with $10,000, I believe I can get more. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I want to see if he's truly interested in the product or just trying to lowball me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $12,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also showing Bob that I am confident in the value of my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is a good compromise. It's a significant improvement from his previous offer and only $1,000 below my ideal price.  Since we're nearing the middle of the negotiation rounds, I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to push for a higher price."
