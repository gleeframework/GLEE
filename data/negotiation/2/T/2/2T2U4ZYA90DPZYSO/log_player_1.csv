Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before anyone else.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state the product's value to you, it implies a high value by mentioning a ""chance to purchase before anyone else.""
* **Gauging interest:**  This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest. If he flat-out rejects it, you haven't lost anything and can proceed with John. If he counter-offers, you can then negotiate down towards your minimum acceptable price, knowing you have John as a backup."
