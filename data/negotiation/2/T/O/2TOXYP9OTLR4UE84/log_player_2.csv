"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm interested in selling you this product. I'm willing to let it go for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $100 is less than its worth to her, you know you can get the product for $80 from John. You should reject this offer and pursue the better deal."
