"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit higher than my budget. How about $7500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $7500 is unfortunately too low for me. How about $8500? That's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, and $8500 is closer to what I can afford.  Let's split the difference and go with $8250.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal.",8250.0,Bob,4,
