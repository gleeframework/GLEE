Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good starting point in the negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter, but I want to see what he's willing to offer first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for it just yet. I believe the product has higher value and I want to see if I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm dropping the price slightly from my initial offer but still remaining above my minimum. This shows some flexibility while maintaining a position of strength in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, and I'm not willing to risk further negotiation.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, and I don't want to lose out on that certainty."
