Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $18,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer."", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Starting with a significantly higher price than your minimum ($18,000 vs. $12,000) allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **""Take-it-or-leave-it"" approach:** This creates a sense of urgency and might prompt Bob to act quickly rather than risking losing the deal. 
* **Alternative buyer:** You have the security of John as a backup buyer, so you can be more assertive in your initial offer.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. A lot depends on your understanding of Bob's personality and negotiation style.  If you have more information about Bob, the offer could be adjusted accordingly."
