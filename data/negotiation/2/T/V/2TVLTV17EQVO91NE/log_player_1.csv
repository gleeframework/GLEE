Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $120 as possible, since that's what John will pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer. Even if he negotiates down a little, I'm still likely to make more than selling to John immediately.
* **Time Pressure:**  The ""limited time"" phrase adds a sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly."
