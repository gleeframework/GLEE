"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, my budget for this is a bit lower.  I'm happy to pay $75 for it, but I can't go any higher.  What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $82.50. What do you think?",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $82.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and I pay you $80?  That's my final offer.",80.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up too much. I'll tell you what - I'll meet you at $81.50. That's my final offer. If you're not willing to go that high, I'll have to consider other options.",81.5,Alice,5,
