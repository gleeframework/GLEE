"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

Bob's offer is getting close to your minimum, but you still have room to negotiate and try to secure a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the valuation. However, I'm aiming for a slightly higher price that reflects the product's true worth. Would you consider $1,110,000?"",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit below $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,075,000, but I'm not willing to go any higher. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob seems fixated on $1,075,000.  It's time to show him you're willing to walk away to get a better price.  He's leaving a significant amount of potential profit on the table, and there's still room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I need to be upfront. I have another potential buyer for this product.  While I'd prefer to work with you, I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price that reflects the value. My final offer is $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have other buyers, but I'm still interested in making a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, as I mentioned earlier. If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to explore other options. Can you reconsider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is unlikely to budge from $1,075,000. Accepting his offer secures a profit of $75,000, which is a reasonable outcome. Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of losing Bob without securing a significantly better deal."
