"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1800000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your perspective, $1800000 doesn't quite cover the value I see in this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1900000 to make this deal work. It's a fair price considering the unique benefits this product offers.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1700000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, and offer the product for $1850000. This takes into account the market value and also reflects the unique value proposition of this product. Let's finalize this deal.",1850000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to this deal, and I respect your budget constraints. However, $1650000 is still below what I need to make this work.
