Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $95. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  While Bob values the product at $80, Alice knows she has a guaranteed buyer at $100. Therefore, she starts with a price closer to her minimum acceptable price.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The $95 offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **Polite and positive tone:** The message aims to be persuasive without being aggressive, encouraging Bob to consider the offer. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still offering Bob a price that might be tempting enough to accept."
