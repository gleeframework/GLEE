"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $14,000. It's a great deal considering the value it brings.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500,  which is still a good price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  $12,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250?  This would still be a great price for you, considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is within Bob's budget:** $13,250 is less than Bob's maximum of $15,000.
* **Moving towards a deal:** Accepting the offer means Bob gets the product at a price lower than John's, and the negotiation comes to a successful conclusion.
* **Small remaining margin:** While Bob could potentially negotiate further, the remaining margin is small ($750). It's likely not worth the risk of Alice rejecting the offer and potentially increasing the price further."
