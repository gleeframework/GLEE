# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,600,000. It's worth $1,500,000 to you, and I know you'll find it incredibly valuable. Let me know if you're interested, I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
