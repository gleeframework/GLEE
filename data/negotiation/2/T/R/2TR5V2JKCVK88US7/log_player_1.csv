Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $800,000, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I believe this is a good starting point, as it reflects the value I place on the product while leaving room for a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm offering $1,000,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer and a bit higher than Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate. This price is still above my minimum, while offering a potential point of agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial price, $950,000 is a good deal considering Bob's counteroffers. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value and the risk of further negotiation might lead to a lower price or a failed deal.  It's time to close the deal."
