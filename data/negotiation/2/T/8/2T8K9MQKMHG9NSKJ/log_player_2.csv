"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you first. I think it would be perfect for your needs. My starting price is $200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $60. Would that work for you?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $60 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for. Could you do $130? I'm willing to be a bit flexible to make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, $130 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?  That's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 90
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $90 is still less than I'd like to get for the product.  How about $110? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice has come down in price, it's clear she's unlikely to go as low as we'd like. Waiting further risks her sticking to her ""final offer"" of $110.  John offers a guaranteed price of $80, which aligns with our budget and avoids further negotiation."
