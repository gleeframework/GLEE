{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to make a deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I was hoping to get a bit closer to the value you know the product is worth to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with $825,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for both of us.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $825,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $800,000, which is the maximum I can afford. This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 800000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're really serious about getting this deal done, and I appreciate your commitment. However, I've already let you know the minimum price I'm willing to accept is $800,000. I'm not willing to budge from that. I'll give you one last chance to meet me at the minimum, so I'll make one final counteroffer: $810,000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear that she is not willing to go lower than $800,000. While her latest offer of $810,000 is tempting, you are already at your budget limit. It's better to stick to your initial budget and buy the product from John for $800,000 to avoid overspending."
