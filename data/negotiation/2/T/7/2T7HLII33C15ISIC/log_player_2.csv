You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $170 is way above your maximum budget of $120.
* It's better to reject and make a counteroffer to see if you can get a better price. 
* John is a reliable alternative if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a lower price than my maximum of $120 to leave room for negotiation. 
* This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but it's still a fair starting point considering my willingness to pay $120.
* I want to see if Alice is willing to come down in price, and this offer might encourage her to start a negotiation."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $130 is still above my maximum budget of $120.
* While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still within the negotiation phase and can potentially get a better deal.
* It's worth rejecting and making another counteroffer to see if I can push Alice further down in price.
* John is always a reliable alternative if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise.
*  $115 is still within my budget and is a good middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's current offer.
*  This counteroffer demonstrates my seriousness in acquiring the product while still trying to get a better price. 
* If Alice rejects this offer, I'll consider buying from John."
