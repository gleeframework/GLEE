Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  At $900,000, Bob is still getting a good deal, making him more likely to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price:** You're still well above your minimum of $1,000,000, leaving room for negotiation. 

This strategy aims to start the negotiation by offering a price that is appealing to Bob while still leaving room for you to gain a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I believe we can find a better solution for both of us. How about I offer $850,000 for the product? This would allow me to stay within my budget while still getting a fair deal for you. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price that's more beneficial to me. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This would still allow you to make a good profit, while also giving me a fair return on my investment.  Let's try to reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Bridge the gap:**  It's a compromise between your previous offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Highlight the value:** It emphasizes that you're willing to be flexible, but you're also confident in the product's value.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  It avoids sounding aggressive, keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $875,000 is closer than previous offers, I still feel it's a bit high given my budget constraints. Could you consider coming down to $860,000? This would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $860,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target,  the negotiation has been going on for a few rounds, and I need to consider the time and effort involved. Accepting this offer will still result in a significant profit for me."
