"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a fantastic deal for something worth at least $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in your product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but that's my final offer. Can you consider it?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to go up to $9,800, but I'm still aiming for a bit more.  Let's split the difference at $10,150. It's a fair price for both of us and avoids any further negotiation.",10150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $10,150. I'm willing to go up to $9,900, but that's my absolute limit. Can you meet me there?",9900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're pushing for a lower price, but $9,900 is still a bit too far from my target.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is my absolute minimum.  This way, we can both get a good deal and move forward.",10000.0,Alice,7,
