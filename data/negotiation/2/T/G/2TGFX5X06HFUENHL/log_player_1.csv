"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $14,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $14000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm happy to pay $12000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
It's risky to accept Bob's offer right away, even though it's our minimum. Let's see if we can squeeze a little more out of him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to be flexible and come down to $13,000.  This still gives me some room to make a profit, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to both of us. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $13000 is closer to what I can do,  I'm still only able to pay $12500. This is a fair compromise and would be a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $12,500 is getting close to our minimum, and we've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation. Accepting his offer secures a sale that's higher than our minimum and avoids the risk of further rounds potentially leading to a lower price or a sale to John at our minimum."
