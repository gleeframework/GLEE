"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's a great investment for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. Would you like to make an offer of $1,200,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is below your maximum budget, it's a good idea to see if she'll go lower.  You have room to negotiate before reaching your fallback option of buying from John for $1,500,000."
