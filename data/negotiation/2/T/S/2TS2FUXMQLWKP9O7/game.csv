"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. As we discussed, I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product to me. However,  $10,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value you've assigned to the product.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value I've assigned to the product and the value you've assigned to it as well.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to offer $9,000. This is a fair price considering we're both willing to compromise, and it's much closer to my maximum budget. Let's see if we can close this deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is still a bit below my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",9250.0,Alice,5,
