"Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but it's a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $900,000 to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? This price still leaves room for you to get a great deal, and it gets us closer to a final agreement.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $875,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget to ensure the deal is worthwhile for me.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $875,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to make one last compromise. If you can go up to $900,000, we can close this deal. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it allows me to achieve my target. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, but I need to stay within my budget to ensure the deal is worthwhile for me.",875000.0,Bob,6,
