"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential for your business, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and potential, aiming to justify the high initial price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This strong opening stance positions me advantageously for the remaining rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the opportunity, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $1,200,000. I appreciate your understanding. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer matches his stated maximum budget, indicating he might be less flexible than initially hoped. Accepting would mean a significant loss compared to my minimum and what John is offering. Proceeding to the next round allows me to gauge his willingness to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it falls significantly short of what I believe the product is worth. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this price reflects the true value and potential this product holds for your specific needs."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:** While I've reduced my asking price substantially, it's still significantly above both Bob's offer and my minimum. This signals a willingness to negotiate while maintaining a strong position.
* **Focus on Value:** I continue to emphasize the product's unique value and tailoring to Bob's needs, hoping to justify the higher price point.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will reveal whether Bob is open to moving closer to my range or if he's firmly set at his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,600,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, having increased his offer significantly. However, $1,600,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I risk losing him as a buyer, I'll use the next round to propose a price closer to my target, leaving some room for a final compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate you working with me on the price. Let's make this happen - I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise that acknowledges its true value."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Bob's latest offer and my previous price, demonstrating willingness to compromise while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price.
* **Finality:** By stating this is my final offer, I'm applying pressure for Bob to accept. This also leaves room to switch to John if needed. 
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  Framing the price as a ""fair compromise"" aims to make it more appealing to Bob, suggesting it's a win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your flexibility. Considering the ongoing negotiations, I would like to propose a price of $1,650,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable and moves us closer to closing the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum, Acceptable Loss:** Bob's offer of $1,650,000 is above my absolute minimum of $1,500,000. While not ideal, the $50,000 difference is an acceptable loss compared to the risk of continuing negotiations.
* **Deal Momentum:** Bob continues to increase his offer, signaling a strong desire to purchase. Accepting now capitalizes on this momentum and avoids potentially alienating him.
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging negotiations carries the risk of Bob reducing his offer or walking away. Accepting now secures a favorable price without further delay."
