"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than what the product is worth to Bob ($1,500,000), it's still quite high. Bob can likely get a better deal by counter-offering. There's a significant gap between Alice's asking price and Bob's maximum willingness to pay, leaving room for negotiation."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.

Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's new offer is lower than her initial one, it's still a bit higher than Bob's initial counteroffer. Bob has room to negotiate further and potentially secure a better price. He can try to meet Alice halfway again, or even make a slightly lower offer to see if she's willing to come down further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to make one more concession to meet you in the middle. I'll offer the product to you for $812,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me and my original asking price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $812,500.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice's offer is very close to Bob's initial counteroffer of $750,000. Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a lower price, but there's a risk that Alice will walk away and Bob will have to buy from John at a much higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most reasonable option as it provides a significant saving compared to buying from John, while still allowing Bob to secure the product."
