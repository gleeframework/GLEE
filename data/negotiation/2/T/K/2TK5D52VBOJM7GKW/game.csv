"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $850000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $975000. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and I offer $912500?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",912500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1000000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $995000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.
