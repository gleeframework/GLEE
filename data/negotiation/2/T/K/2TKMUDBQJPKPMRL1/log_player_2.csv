"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to pay closer to $8,500.  Let me know if you're open to that price."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's offer of $10,000 and closer to Bob's target price. Continuing to negotiate might get a slightly lower price, but there's a risk Alice could walk away or Bob might end up paying more with John.  It's better to take the secure deal at this point."
