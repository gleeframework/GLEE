Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum price:** You're aiming for a profit and $9,500 is a good starting point.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** You can adjust your price based on Bob's response and still potentially get a better deal than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to pay closer to $8500.  Let me know if you're open to that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's offer, it's still below my minimum desired price. I believe there's room for further negotiation and a higher price is achievable.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 9000}
