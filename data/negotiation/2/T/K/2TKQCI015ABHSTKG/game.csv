"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's work together to make this happen.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the market. Let me know if you're open to this offer.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $925,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $940,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe we can reach an agreement.  Let's close this deal!",940000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $940,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but that's as high as I can go. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the market. Let me know if you're open to this offer.",920000.0,Bob,6,
