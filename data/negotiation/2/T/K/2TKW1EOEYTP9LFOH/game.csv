"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand it's a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $160. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $130.  If we can't agree on something closer to that, I may have to look at other options.",130.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go down to $135. I can offer it to you for $140. It's the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal. Let me know if it works for you.",140.0,Alice,7,
