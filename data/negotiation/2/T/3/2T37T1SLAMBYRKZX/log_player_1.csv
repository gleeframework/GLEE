Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still working within my budget constraints. I would like to propose a price of $800,000, which is closer to what I'm willing to pay.

While I could try to push for more, Bob arriving at my minimum acceptable price means further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better result. It's time to close the deal."
