Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum price.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts.  Since you know Bob values the product more than you, there's room for negotiation. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I propose a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You highlight the product's value and Bob's potential gain.
* **High but Fair Price:** $1,150,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($150,000 profit) while leaving Bob with a $50,000 gain compared to his perceived value. 
* **Confidence:** You don't need to lowball because you have John as a backup.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation example. In reality, Bob might counter-offer, leading to further exchanges."
