"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1400000. This is a great deal, considering its worth to you is $1200000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1350000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $1300000. This price reflects the value of the product for me and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm still not willing to go as low as $1300000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $1320000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you think?",1320000.0,Alice,5,
