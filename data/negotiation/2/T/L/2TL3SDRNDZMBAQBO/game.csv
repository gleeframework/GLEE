"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $175 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product.  Let me know what you think!",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $140 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $155? I'm sure you'll agree it's a fair price for a product you value at $150. Let me know what you think!",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $155 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference at $152.50?  That's a fair price for both of us, and gets this deal done.",152.5,Bob,4,
