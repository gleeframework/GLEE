"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested in the product,  $15000 is a bit out of my budget right now. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $12000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13500. This price still gives you a great value for the product, and it's a fair compromise. Let me know if you're interested.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $13500 is closer, but still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,4,
