"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1350000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. I'm confident this is a mutually beneficial deal, and I'm open to discussing it further.",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle and make this happen.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1100000. I'm willing to compromise, so how about we meet at $1150000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1150000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1200000. This price is fair to both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. Let's not let this opportunity slip away.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
