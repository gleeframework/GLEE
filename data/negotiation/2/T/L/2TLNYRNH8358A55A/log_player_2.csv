Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. We understand your position and are willing to further discuss the terms.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly, the price is still above your budget.  It's getting close, but the risk of further negotiation is too high. You've already rejected two offers, and Alice might not be willing to budge further. It's time to go with the sure thing and buy from John for $1,000,000.  You've saved $150,000 by not accepting Alice's initial offer."
