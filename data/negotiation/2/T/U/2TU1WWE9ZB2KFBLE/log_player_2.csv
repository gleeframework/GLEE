"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $14,000.  Since Alice's minimum selling price is $12,000, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your offer of $13,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $13,500. This is a fair price, taking into account the product's value to you and my initial offer. Let me know if this works for you!

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than his maximum budget of $15,000 and closer to his desired price than his previous counteroffer.  Accepting this offer saves Bob $1,500 compared to buying from John."
