{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $8,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts high, giving me room to negotiate down if Bob counters. It also highlights the value of the product without revealing my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $6,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $8,000."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate further. $6,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm open to meeting in the middle. How about $7,500? It's a fair compromise and still a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 7500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $6500? It's a good compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $6,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $6,500 is still below my minimum. To make this work, I need to be at $7,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $6800, which is the closest I can get to your final offer. Can you consider this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $6,800 is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to risk going lower and potentially losing out on a better deal.  Selling to John for $8,000 ensures I get at least my minimum and avoids further negotiation."
