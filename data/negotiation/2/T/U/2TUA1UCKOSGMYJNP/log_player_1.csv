Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $15,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, but also gives me a good starting point to try and maximize my profit.  I'll be prepared to counter Bob's offer if he makes one, but I'll also be watching for signs that he's not serious about buying and be ready to walk away and sell to John if necessary."

Bob's offer is right at my minimum, but I believe the product has higher value to him. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate higher."

I'm going to counter with $18,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's.  I'm hoping he'll be willing to meet me halfway to close the deal."
