Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You're still getting a significant profit.
* **It's a strong opening offer:** It shows you're serious about selling but aren't giving away the farm. 

Remember, you can always adjust your price based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,200,000 is a decent amount, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is too far below what I need. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. It's a fair compromise, and it's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and the negotiation seems to be getting stuck. While I could keep going back and forth, it's taking time, and John is a guaranteed sale for a higher price. I'm going to take the sure thing and sell to John."
