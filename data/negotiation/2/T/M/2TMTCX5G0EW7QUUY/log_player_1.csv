{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is my initial offer to Bob. I'm starting high, knowing my product is worth at least $100 to me. This will give me room to negotiate if needed, and it's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is there any wiggle room on the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $80 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value for the product. I'm going to try and negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $80 is tempting, it's below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $90?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from $100 to $90, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm tempted to continue negotiating with Bob, I'm worried that we're getting too close to my minimum price.  John is already willing to pay my minimum, so I'm going to take the sure thing and sell the product to him."
