"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I think you'll really love it, and I'm willing to start the conversation at a price of $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is far above his maximum budget of $8,000. He should counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I can meet you in the middle at $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $15,000. What do you think?

While $12,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget. He should reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $11,000 is closer to his budget, he can still get the product from John for $8,000. He should counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to John's offer."
