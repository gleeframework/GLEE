"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe you'll love. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in!",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. Let's try $1,025,000. This is a fair price that I think we can both be happy with.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference again. I'm willing to offer $987,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",987500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $987,500. I'm willing to meet you at $1,015,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1015000.0,Alice,5,
