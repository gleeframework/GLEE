"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate and potentially earn more than my minimum.  I'm confident that Bob will counteroffer, as he's clearly interested in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum of $10,000. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get closer to my target price.  I will counteroffer and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm offering $10,500. This is still higher than what Bob offered, but it's closer to his target price and shows my willingness to compromise. I believe this could lead to a quick agreement in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has increased his offer to $9,500. While still below my minimum, it's very close.  Given that I'm only 500 dollars away from my target price, I believe accepting the offer is the best decision.  This ensures a deal without risking further negotiation and the possibility of Bob walking away."
