Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $950,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with an ambitious but still somewhat reasonable offer. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a higher final price.
* **Close to Bob's Value:** Knowing the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, starting at $950,000 positions the offer just below his perceived value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message emphasizes fairness but also implies a willingness to discuss the price further, opening the door for Bob to counteroffer. 
* **Walk-Away Option:**  Remember, you always have the option to sell to John for $800,000.  This knowledge empowers you to walk away from the negotiation if it's not progressing favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly lower than your target price. While it's higher than your minimum selling point ($800,000), there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer and presenting a counter-offer, you can try to steer the price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to find a good deal. However, $850,000 significantly undervalues the true worth and potential of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about we settle on $900,000? This reflects my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  This approach often feels reasonable to both parties in a negotiation. It shows flexibility while still aiming for a strong price.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message reiterates the product's value, subtly reminding Bob of what's at stake if they don't reach an agreement. 
* **Conveying Willingness to Deal:**  By saying ""mutually beneficial agreement,"" you signal that you are serious about closing the deal but not at any cost."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Bob's offer of $875,000 is a reasonable compromise. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** You're still securing a $75,000 profit above your minimum selling price.
* **Avoiding Further Negotiation:**  Each counteroffer carries the risk of Bob walking away or becoming more entrenched in a lower price. Accepting now provides certainty.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing negotiations means potentially losing time and missing other opportunities. 

By accepting, you secure a good profit and avoid the potential downsides of prolonged negotiation."
