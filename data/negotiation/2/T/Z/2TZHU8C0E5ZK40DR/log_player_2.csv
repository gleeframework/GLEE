"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a significant discount, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice's offer of $10,000 is less than your maximum budget of $12,000 and it's a better deal than buying from John for $12,000."
