"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's not in your best interest to accept Alice's offer, as the product is only worth $100 to you. You can always get the product for a better price from John.  You should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95} 
```

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still leaves some room for negotiation. It's important to remember that you have the option to buy from John for $100, so you don't want to get stuck in a protracted negotiation that wastes time."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is still higher than what you are willing to pay.  While you could continue negotiating, it's not worth the risk of losing out on a guaranteed deal with John for a better price. It's more efficient to take John's offer."
