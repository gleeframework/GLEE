"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $13500 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price ($12,000).** I won't accept it.
* **I have more negotiating room.**  There are still 8 rounds left. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price of $14,500."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a deal, but $13,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $14,000? This still gives you a good value for the product."", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $13200 for the product. Can you consider this price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.**  I won't accept it.
* **I have more negotiating room.**  There are still 6 rounds left. I can still potentially get closer to my target price of $14,500 or, at the very least, a price closer to $12,000 before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us.  Let's try $13,800.  This is a fair price for the value you'll get.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13800}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence. I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.**  There are only 4 rounds left, and I don't have much room to negotiate up. 
* **Selling to John is the best option now.**  I'm guaranteed $12,000, which is my minimum threshold.  There's a risk that Bob might not budge further, and I'd end up with a lower price."
