"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn more than my minimum price. I'm also being friendly and optimistic to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I have 8 rounds remaining to negotiate with Bob, so there's still potential to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm making a counteroffer that is still above my minimum price but closer to Bob's offer. I'm trying to find a middle ground that we can both agree on. I'm also reiterating the value of the product to justify my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down. $8,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $8,200 for the product. This is a fair price that's close to my budget, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'm willing to accept it because it's within my acceptable range and I'm confident that I can still make a good profit on the sale.  Additionally, I'm concerned that if I reject his offer, he might walk away, and I'll be left with the option of selling to John for my minimum price."
