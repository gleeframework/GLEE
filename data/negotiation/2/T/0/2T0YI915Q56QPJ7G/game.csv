"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1,200,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation and brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not quite there yet.  Given the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges your budget constraints while also reflecting the product's true worth. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product and your willingness to negotiate, I am still constrained by my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000 for the product. I hope this proposal helps us move closer to reaching an agreement that is acceptable for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
