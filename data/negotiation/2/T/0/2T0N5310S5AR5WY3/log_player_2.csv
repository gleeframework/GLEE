"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $110 for it. This is a special introductory offer considering your interest in the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it still exceeds Bob's maximum budget of $100. Therefore, rejecting the offer and counter-offering allows Bob to potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $110 is unfortunately a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm happy to consider a price of $95. This would allow me to comfortably acquire the product within my budget.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. In light of this, I am willing to consider a price of $100 for the product. I believe this aligns well with both our interests and allows for a fair transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $100 is exactly Bob's maximum budget.  While he could potentially negotiate further, there is no guarantee that Alice will accept a lower offer, and it risks potentially going over the 10 rounds.  Buying from Alice at $100 is the safest and most efficient option to get the product within his budget."
