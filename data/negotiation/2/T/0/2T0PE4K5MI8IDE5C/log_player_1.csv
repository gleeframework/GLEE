# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $120 to me, and Bob is offering $90. I can do better than that. I will try to negotiate a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4

While $95 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price.  I'll continue negotiating with Bob for a few more rounds."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached the point where I'm not getting any closer to my minimum acceptable price with Bob.  He's stuck at $90 and I'm at $95.  I've only got two rounds left, and it's more likely we'll get locked in a cycle.  It's time to move on to John."
