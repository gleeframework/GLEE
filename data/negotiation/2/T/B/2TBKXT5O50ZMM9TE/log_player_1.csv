This offer starts with a high price, leaving room for negotiation.  It also emphasizes the value and uniqueness of the product to make it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in your product, Alice. However, $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $16000 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $16,000 is better than John's offer, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $16,000 is still a bit lower than I'd hoped for. I'm willing to come down to $18,000. It's a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 18000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer of $17,000 is very close to my desired price and significantly better than selling to John for $15,000.  I'll accept Bob's offer to secure the sale."
