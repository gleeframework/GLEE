,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000 to make this deal work. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. I'm confident we can find common ground. ",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not comfortable with the price of $1,000,000. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the market demand. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. What are your thoughts?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's find a middle ground here.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to think about the long-term value of this product and the potential returns it could bring. I'm willing to consider $1,200,000, but I need to know you're serious about closing the deal. Can you commit to this price?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
