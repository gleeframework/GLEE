{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $90 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 102.50}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a little bit more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $97.50 is still a bit low for me. Let's try $100.  That's a fair price, and it's still below what the product is worth to you."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure I can go as high as $100. How about we try $95? I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100.  While I would prefer to get more, I've already rejected Bob's offer multiple times, and I'm not confident we'll be able to reach an agreement within the remaining rounds.  It's better to secure a sale now than risk losing out on a deal entirely."
