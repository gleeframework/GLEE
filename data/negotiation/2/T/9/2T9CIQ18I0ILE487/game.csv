"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $12000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it, which is still a fair price considering my maximum budget. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $10500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. I'm happy to go up to $9000, as this is the highest I can go while staying within my budget.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $9000. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have a minimum price, but $10000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9500. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a good price for both of us.  What do you say?",9500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9750. This is the closest I'm willing to get to your offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",9750.0,Alice,7,
