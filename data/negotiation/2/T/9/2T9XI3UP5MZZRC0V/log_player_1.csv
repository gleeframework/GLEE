Round 2
Bob's offer:

``` 
 
I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob. I know the product is worth at least $80 to me, so I'm not going to settle for that price just yet."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob!  While $80 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price of $100. How about we split the difference and meet at $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant at $90. I was thinking more like $85. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $85. It's a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether by continuing to negotiate."
