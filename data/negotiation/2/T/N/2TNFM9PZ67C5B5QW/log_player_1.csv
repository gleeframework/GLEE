Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm willing to part with it for $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, it's always best to try and secure the highest possible price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below my absolute floor gives Bob the impression of a potential deal and allows room for negotiation if he counters. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** Highlighting the limited-time nature of the offer and its exclusivity can incentivize Bob to act quickly.
* **Value Proposition:**  Instead of just stating a price, I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, making the offer more enticing.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit from Bob while ensuring I still have John as a guaranteed buyer."
