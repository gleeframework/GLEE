Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum ($100) to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my price based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering Bob a price closer to his offer, but still above my minimum. I believe this is a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to get a bit more, Bob's last offer is below my minimum and further negotiation is unlikely to get me a better price.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum and avoids further negotiation time."
