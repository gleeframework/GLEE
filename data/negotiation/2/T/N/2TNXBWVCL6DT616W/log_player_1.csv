Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your Limits:** You have a strong fallback option with John ($1,500,000), ensuring you won't settle for less.
* **Targeting Bob's Value:**  While the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, there's room to negotiate above that since it solves a problem for him. 
* **Strategic Starting Point:** The offer of $1,300,000 is a strong opening. It's significantly above Bob's perceived value but leaves you space to negotiate down if needed, while staying well above your minimum. 

**Important Note:** This is just the opening move. Bob's response will dictate how you proceed with the negotiation. Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on his reaction."
