"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $975,000 is still a bit lower than I was thinking. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
