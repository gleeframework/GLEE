Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $150. This gives me a good margin over my minimum acceptable price of $120.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm aiming for a price that's attractive but also leaves me room for negotiation if needed. If he rejects the offer, I'll be happy to sell it to John for $120."
