"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I believe a starting price of $13,500 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with a strong offer above my minimum to leave room for negotiation and gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's value, I aim to anchor Bob's perception closer to my asking price.
* **Open-ended Question:** This invites Bob to engage in the conversation and potentially reveal more about his valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,500 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob's offer of $8,500 confirms his valuation is in the ballpark we anticipated. 
* **Negotiating Room:** While $8,500 is closer to his valuation than mine, I have room to negotiate downwards and still potentially secure a better deal than John's offer. 
* **Early Stage:** It's still early in the negotiation, and abruptly accepting his first counteroffer might signal desperation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. I'm willing to be flexible, but $8,500 is significantly below its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I've made a significant drop from $13,500 to $11,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate.
* **Midpoint:** By suggesting the midpoint, I'm aiming for a price that feels fairer to both parties. 
* **Value Assertion:** I reiterate the product's worth to counter his lower offer and avoid devaluing the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Favorable Offer:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is a significant improvement and is now very close to John's guaranteed offer. 
* **Negotiating Trend:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, suggesting he's motivated to buy. Pushing further might make him walk away.
* **Time Value & Risk:**  Accepting now secures a good price without the risk of further negotiation or Bob potentially changing his mind."
