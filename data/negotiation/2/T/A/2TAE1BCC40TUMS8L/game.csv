"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product looks great, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $875,000, which is a fair compromise and would allow us both to walk away satisfied. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $875,000 is a bit lower than my previous counteroffer, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm still not willing to go below $920,000. I'm counteroffering at $915,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",915000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $915,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm firm on $890,000.  This is a great price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we're both reasonable. Let's close this deal!",890000.0,Bob,6,
