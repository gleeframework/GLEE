"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. It's a one-time opportunity, and I'm confident you'll see the immense potential it holds. Let me know your thoughts!",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Would you consider reducing the price to $1200000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1200000 doesn't fully reflect the true value of this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This is a fair compromise that allows you to acquire a valuable asset while still giving me a reasonable return. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1100000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product.  I'm willing to make one final compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $1200000? This is my last offer, as I have another interested buyer ready to purchase at a slightly higher price.  Let me know if this works for you.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for considering my budget constraints. I would like to propose a final price of $1050000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given its value and my financial situation.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
