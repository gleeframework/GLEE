"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only go up to $850,000 right now.  This is a fair price considering the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential benefits to your business.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
