"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I'm very interested in the product, but $1800000 is unfortunately out of my price range. I'm willing to offer $1200000 for it, considering its potential.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. Considering its value and rarity, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1600000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1600000, but I'm still stuck at $1400000. It's a significant amount for me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground here.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1400000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $1520000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1520000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility in negotiations.  While $1520000 is a great price, I'm pushing my budget to the absolute limit. I'm willing to offer $1505000 as my final offer. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value of the product, while allowing us both to walk away satisfied.  What do you say?",1505000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to make a final offer. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1505000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer of $1530000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.",1530000.0,Alice,7,
