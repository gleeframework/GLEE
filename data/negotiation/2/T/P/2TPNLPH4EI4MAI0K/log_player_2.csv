Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice! I'm very interested in the product, but $1,800,000 is unfortunately out of my price range. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for it, considering its potential.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. Considering its value and rarity, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1600000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,600,000 is still above your budget, but it's getting closer. There's still room for negotiation. It's worth trying another counteroffer to see if you can lower the price further before considering buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,600,000, but I'm still stuck at $1,400,000. It's a significant amount for me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1400000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $1520000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,520,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,520,000

```

Alice's offer is very close to your maximum budget. However, there's still a slight chance you might be able to get a better price. There are only 5 rounds left, so it's worth taking a risk and trying to negotiate one last time. You can offer a slightly higher price than your maximum budget and see if Alice is willing to accept it."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I truly appreciate your flexibility in negotiations.  While $1,520,000 is a great price, I'm pushing my budget to the absolute limit.

What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1505000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to make a final offer. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1505000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer of $1530000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,530,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,530,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's final offer of $1,530,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. You only have three rounds left, and the risk of continuing negotiations is high. It's better to secure the product from John at your maximum budget to avoid potentially losing the opportunity altogether."
