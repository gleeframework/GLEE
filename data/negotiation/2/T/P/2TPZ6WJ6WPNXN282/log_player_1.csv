"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive Tone:** I use a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob's interest. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  Mentioning that the product is ""worth a lot to me"" suggests its value and potential for him as well. 

**Strategy:**

This approach balances maximizing potential profit while keeping the negotiation open. If Bob rejects, I'll have a clear understanding of his perceived value and can adjust my counteroffers accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value to you, but I believe I can offer a fair price of $9500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is close to my minimum value, I'm not ready to settle yet. I believe I can push for a higher price, especially since Bob is clearly interested.

**Strategy:**

Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going. I'll counteroffer at a price slightly lower than my initial offer, giving Bob room to accept while still getting closer to my desired profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my original asking price. How about $9,750?  Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but not by a huge amount. This demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product.
* **Emphasis on Agreement:** I'm using language that emphasizes finding a price that works for both of us.  This maintains a positive tone and encourages Bob to see the potential for a deal. 
* **Specific Price:**  Offering a concrete number shows that I've seriously considered Bob's counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is designed to test Bob's willingness to go higher. If he accepts, I'll be closer to my goal. If he rejects, I'll have a better idea of his upper limit and can adjust my next counteroffer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I would like to counter with an offer of $9600. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value ($8,000) and only $150 away from my last counteroffer.  Given that we're in round 4 and there are only 6 rounds left, it's worth accepting his offer to secure the deal. 

**Strategy:**

It's crucial to weigh the potential for further negotiation against the risk of losing the deal. While I might be able to push for a slightly higher price, the chance of rejection and further rounds is high. Accepting now ensures a sale within my minimum acceptable range."
