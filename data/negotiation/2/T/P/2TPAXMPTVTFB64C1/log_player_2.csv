"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth more than what others might be willing to pay. Considering its true worth, I propose we start our negotiation at $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate downwards and should aim to get closer to Alice's perceived value of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the product is valuable, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim Low:**  We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's starting price. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while staying well below our $15,000 maximum.
* **Justification:** By mentioning that the price is ""a bit steep,"" we subtly signal that we might be willing to budge a little, but not by much.
* **Target Value:**  Our goal is to land somewhere near Alice's value of $12,000.  Starting low increases our chances of achieving a more favorable outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your input. In light of our discussion, I am willing to consider a price closer to your suggestion. My counteroffer is $12,500 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming closer to her perceived value, but we can still try to negotiate a slightly better price. We are now in a good position to make smaller concessions and see if she'll meet us closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer.  How about we settle on $11,750? I think that's a fair price that acknowledges the value of your product."",
""product_price"": 11750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're incrementally increasing our offer from $11,000 to $11,750, demonstrating willingness to move but not too drastically.
* **Finding Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims to find a compromise between Alice's $12,500 and our previous $11,000. 
* **Positive Language:**  We continue using positive language (""fair price,"" ""acknowledges the value"") to maintain a good negotiating relationship."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you found my previous offer acceptable, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. My counteroffer is $12,250 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:**  Alice's counteroffer of $12,250 is only $250 above her perceived value and a very good price considering our $15,000 limit. 
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  Continuing to negotiate for a small potential gain could lead Alice to walk away or become less willing to compromise.
* **Time Factor:**  We are past the halfway point in the negotiation, and securing a good price now is preferable to potentially running out of rounds and having to buy from John at a higher price."
