"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $9,250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $9,000 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,125.  Let's see if we can finally strike a deal.",9125.0,Alice,5,
