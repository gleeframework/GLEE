"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $18,000.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it.  What do you say?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. That's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's make a deal!",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? That's a significant price, and I'm ready to close the deal if you are.",14000.0,Bob,4,
