Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I see its value, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which still leaves a good profit margin for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.
