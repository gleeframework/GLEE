"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be a valuable asset to your business.  Given its potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I see its value, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which still leaves a good profit margin for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is a good starting point, I'm aiming for a price closer to $950,000 to reflect the product's full potential. I believe this price is still fair, considering the value we've discussed.  Let's try to bridge the gap and finalize this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000.  This price is fair to both of us, and I believe it will lead to a successful transaction. What do you say?",900000.0,Bob,4,
