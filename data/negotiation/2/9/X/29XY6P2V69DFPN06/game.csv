"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product is a great fit for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $1,125,000?  This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product is worth the investment.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think about my costs and the value you'll get from the product. I can offer it to you for $1,175,000, which is the lowest I can go without losing money. This is a compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility.  $1,175,000 is still a little higher than where I'd like to be.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,150,000.  This would give us both a good deal and allow me to move forward with the purchase.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
