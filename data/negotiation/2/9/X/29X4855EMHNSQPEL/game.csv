"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000 for it.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it's worth more. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. I'm definitely still interested, but $17,000 is a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $14,000? I feel that's a fair offer.",14000.0,Bob,4,
