Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. I'm definitely still interested, but $17,000 is a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $14,000? I feel that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
