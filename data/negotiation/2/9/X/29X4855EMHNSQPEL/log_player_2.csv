"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is significantly above my maximum budget. I should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $12,000 for it.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price to leave room for negotiation.  This strategy aims to see how flexible she is and establish a lower point in the discussion.
* **Polite and Interested:** Maintaining a positive tone is essential for successful negotiation. I want Alice to know I'm serious about buying but need a price that works for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it's worth more. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice came down in price, $17,000 is still above my $15,000 maximum budget. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Her willingness to negotiate suggests there's potential to reach a more agreeable price. I'll continue counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. I'm definitely still interested, but $17,000 is a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $14,000? I feel that's a fair offer."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** I've increased my offer to $14,000, demonstrating movement and seriousness. This price is still within my budget and leaves a small margin for potential compromise.
* **Justification:** By mentioning my budget constraints and emphasizing the fairness of the offer, I'm hoping to appeal to Alice's sense of reason and encourage her to accept."
