"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,150,000, which is a compromise that still allows me to make a profit while accommodating your budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
