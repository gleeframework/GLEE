"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $12,000, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Focus on value:** I emphasize the product's value to Bob, hoping to make him more inclined to negotiate.
* **Positive tone:** I maintain a positive and friendly tone to encourage a collaborative negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm prepared to negotiate, but I'm not willing to sell below my minimum value of $15,000, as I have an alternative buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **I have a better option:** I can sell to John for $15,000, so accepting Bob's offer would be a major loss.
* **Negotiation potential:** While Bob's offer is too low, he's shown interest in the product, indicating potential for negotiation.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and try to reach a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This would give us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I use a positive tone to encourage continued negotiation and avoid seeming confrontational. 
* **Focus on fairness:** I emphasize that the counteroffer would be fair for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of equity. 
* **Still above minimum:**  $10,500 is still above my minimum acceptable value of $15,000, allowing for further negotiation while still ensuring I get a decent price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob's offer is slightly higher than before, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **Opportunity to improve the offer:** Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, indicating potential for him to increase his offer further.
* **Time on my side:** With 6 rounds remaining, I have time to continue negotiating and see if I can reach a more favorable price.  Selling to John now would mean missing out on potentially earning more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're still hesitant.  While $9,800 is closer, it's still not quite where I need to be.  Let's aim for $10,200.  It's a small step up from your offer, but it would get us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 10200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increment:** I'm increasing my offer by only $400, showing a willingness to compromise while still maintaining my position. 
* **Focus on progress:** I emphasize that this offer is a step closer to a deal, making it seem more appealing to Bob.
* **Emphasize compromise:**  I reiterate that I'm willing to compromise, encouraging Bob to do the same.
* **Still above minimum:**  $10,200 is still higher than my minimum acceptable value, ensuring I don't make a significant loss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $9,900 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** $9,900 is still considerably below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **Time is running out:** We're on round 6, and while Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, he hasn't reached a price close to my acceptable range.
* **Potential for a better offer:**  While selling to John would guarantee a good price, there's still a chance that Bob might increase his offer further, especially with only 4 rounds left.
* **Risk vs. reward:**  The risk of continuing the negotiation is that Bob may not increase his offer significantly, resulting in a lower price. However, the potential reward is that he may get closer to my desired price or even accept a counteroffer.

I'm choosing to continue negotiating, hoping that Bob might increase his offer in the remaining rounds."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're not quite there yet.  Let's try $10,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.  I'm confident this product will be worth it for you."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm again offering a price halfway between Bob's last offer and my previous offer, showing a consistent commitment to compromise.
* **Emphasize fairness:** I highlight that this offer is a fair compromise, appealing to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Positive reinforcement:** I express confidence in the product's value for Bob, hoping to further motivate him to reach an agreement.
* **Closing the gap:**  This offer is still above my minimum acceptable value, but it significantly narrows the gap between our positions, increasing the likelihood of a deal.
* **Time pressure:**  We're now at round 7, and I'm running out of time. This counteroffer reflects a willingness to negotiate but also indicates a need for a resolution soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to accepting, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We're now on round 8, with only two rounds left.
* **Insufficient progress:** Despite repeated negotiations, Bob hasn't shown a strong willingness to increase his offer. His last offer of $9,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John for $15,000 would guarantee a substantial profit and eliminate the risk of further negotiation with Bob, who might not be willing to meet my minimum price.

Therefore, given the time constraints and the lack of significant progress in negotiations with Bob, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $15,000. This ensures I secure a good price and avoid potentially losing money in the final rounds."
