"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point that reflects its significant worth.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price.  Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so how about $1,087,500? This is the highest price I'm willing to pay.",1087500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,087,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept a price that low. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so how about $1,062,500? This is the absolute highest price I'm willing to pay.",1062500.0,Bob,6,
