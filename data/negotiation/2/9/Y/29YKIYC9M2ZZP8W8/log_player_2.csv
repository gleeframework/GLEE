"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I believe it's a great deal, especially considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $140 is less than your maximum budget, there's a chance of getting a better price. By rejecting the offer, you prompt Alice to potentially offer a lower price, as she is motivated to sell."
