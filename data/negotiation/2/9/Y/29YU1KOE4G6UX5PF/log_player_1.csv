"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum. This is a bold move, but it gives me room to negotiate and allows me to see how interested Bob truly is. If he rejects, I can gauge his seriousness by his counteroffer and adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I believe I can still get more. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm going to lower my price slightly to $1,350,000. This shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm still holding firm on getting a price higher than my minimum. This should keep the negotiation moving and hopefully lead to a mutually agreeable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum.  I'm going to reject his offer and counteroffer again.  I'm still hopeful that we can reach a mutually agreeable price, but I'm starting to feel the pressure to sell to John if this negotiation doesn't move forward."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm going to lower my price again, but only slightly to $1,250,000.  This is still above my minimum and shows that I am flexible.  I'm hoping this is enough to sway Bob, but I'm also starting to think about John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is getting frustrating!  Bob is clearly not willing to meet me halfway.  I'm going to sell to John.  While I'd prefer to get more for the product, at least I'm guaranteed my minimum. I need to move on and avoid any further negotiation with Bob."
