Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since John is guaranteed to buy the product for $120, Alice's minimum acceptable price is $120. Offering it to Bob slightly below this at $119 maximizes the potential profit. 
* **First-Mover Advantage:**  By offering it to Bob first at a price he might find appealing, Alice leverages the potential of Bob valuing the deal more than the absolute difference in his perceived value ($80) and the offer price ($119). 
* **Simplicity:** A single price offer is clear and avoids unnecessary back-and-forth negotiation.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might try to negotiate or decline altogether. However, this strategy gives Alice the best chance of maximizing her profit."
