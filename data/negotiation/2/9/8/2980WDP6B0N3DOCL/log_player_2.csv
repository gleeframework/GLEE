Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll counteroffer at $10,750. This is my last offer, and I hope we can meet at this price.

Alice has signaled this is her final offer, and while not ideal, it's a reasonable price within your acceptable range.  Continuing to push risks her walking away, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price."
