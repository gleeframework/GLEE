Round 3

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $115 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, as I'd be getting a good product and you'd be getting a sale."", ""product_price"": 95}

Round 5

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
