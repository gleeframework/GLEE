"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth $150 to you, right?  I'm willing to let it go for $135. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a little high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $100 for the product."",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We start with a strong counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's starting price. This leaves room for negotiation while signaling we're serious buyers.  The goal is to get Alice to counter within a range closer to her known valuation of $120."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 just doesn't work for me. It's worth $150 to you, and I need to make a decent profit. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $125?  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming closer to her valuation, but we still have room to negotiate. We are aiming for a price closer to $110.  Rejecting her offer keeps the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you need to make a profit, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $115? That's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* We're inching closer to a price that works for us while still leaving Alice room to potentially make a small profit.
* By phrasing it as ""meeting in the middle,"" we're suggesting a sense of compromise and fairness."
