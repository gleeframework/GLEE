Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I've already discounted the price from $150 to $120, and now you're asking me to go even lower to $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $115.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than $115. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $112.50, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has lowered her price significantly, and it's likely that she won't go any lower.  You're getting a good deal at $112.50, which is still within your budget and saves you money compared to buying from John."
