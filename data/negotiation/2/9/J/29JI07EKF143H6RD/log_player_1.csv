"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at no less than $1,200,000 to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation at $1,800,000.  This price reflects the unique value and potential it holds. I'm confident this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to discussing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1800000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the value you mentioned earlier. I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,400,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price with some negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,400,000 doesn't quite reflect the value and potential I see in this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This offer still allows me to make a reasonable return on my investment, while hopefully still being attractive to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1500000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, while also being a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has come up to $1,500,000, which is only $100,000 less than my previous offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, accepting this offer is a good decision for a few reasons:

* **Time:** We're already four rounds in, and continuing to negotiate risks running out of time. 
* **Value:**  $1,500,000 is still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for Risk:** Continuing to negotiate could lead to Bob walking away, leaving me with only the $1,200,000 offer from John. 

It's better to secure a strong sale at $1,500,000 than risk losing a deal and getting a lower price."
