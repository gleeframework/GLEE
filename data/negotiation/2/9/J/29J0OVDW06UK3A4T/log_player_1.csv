Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential for you.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation and creates the impression of the product's high value.
* **Justification:** I'm not just throwing out a number; I'm framing it as an ""exclusive opportunity"" and highlighting the ""immense value"" to pique Bob's interest and justify the high price. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  The tone remains collaborative (""What are your thoughts?""). This invites Bob to counter-offer and engage in negotiation, giving me a chance to understand his perspective and potentially still close a deal above my minimum.

**Important Note:**  I know I have a guaranteed sale with John at $1,500,000. This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit. I'm willing to walk away from Bob's offer if it's too low, knowing I have a secure alternative."
