"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1800000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy accordingly.  I know I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000, so I have room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still holding firm on a significant profit. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this product and meet me somewhere in the middle.  I'm not desperate, but I also don't want to risk losing too much time if he's just going to keep making low offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is exactly what I would get from John.  It's a fair price and I don't want to risk losing more time with counteroffers.  I'll take the $1,200,000 and move on."
