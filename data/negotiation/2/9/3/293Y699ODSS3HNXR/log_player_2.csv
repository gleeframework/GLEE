"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,050,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth the investment. Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $1,000,000 and Alice is asking for $1,050,000, it's better to reject her offer. You can get the same product from John for your desired price."
