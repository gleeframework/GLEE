Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value to you, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 925000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Secure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down, a price above $850,000 represents a significant profit compared to selling to John. 

This strategy aims for a win-win: Bob gets the product he values, and I secure a price significantly higher than my minimum."
