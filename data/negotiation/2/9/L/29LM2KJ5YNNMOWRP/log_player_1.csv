{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're asking for more than your minimum of $8,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's attractive to Bob:**  It's below the value he places on the product, making it a potential bargain for him.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation without immediately putting you in a corner."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, you can likely do better. Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your initial offer, potentially securing a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is still a great deal for you, as you value the product at $10,000.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8200. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to John's offer of $8,000, it's still worth trying to negotiate a bit higher. There's a good chance Bob is willing to go up a little to secure the deal. Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer that might get you closer to your desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,200 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,600. This is still a good deal for you, and it's the best I can do right now.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8600}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I can do $8500, but that's as low as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,500 is only $500 less than your previous counteroffer of $8,600.  It's a reasonable price, and you're likely not going to get much more out of Bob.  Since this is close to your desired price, it makes more sense to accept rather than risk another rejection and potentially having to sell to John for less."
