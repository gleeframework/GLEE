"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. Let's start with a fair offer. Would you consider purchasing the product for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, you're aiming to save as much money as possible.  Since you have other options, it makes sense to reject the initial offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in your product, but I can only go as high as $105.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. To move forward, I would like to propose an offer of $115 for the product. This is higher than my initial offer, aiming for a mutual agreement that respects both our valuations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to your desired price, but $115 is still more than you're comfortable paying.  You have the option to buy from John for a lower price, so it makes sense to continue negotiating with Alice to see if you can get a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to go up to $110, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're able to accept."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to your desired price, you're still aiming to save as much as possible. It's worth trying to see if you can negotiate down to your target price of $105. You also have the option to buy from John for $100, so you're not under any significant pressure to accept this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  However, $112 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $108, but that's my final offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 108}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to $110, you are still aiming to save more.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $100, there's no urgency to accept this offer. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a price closer to your target."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer! I'm willing to go up to $107, but I really need to stay within that budget.  This is my final offer - let's see if we can strike a deal."", ""product_price"": 107}
```"

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I've carefully considered your proposal and am willing to accept $108 for the product. I believe this reflects a fair compromise given our respective valuations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a good deal for Bob. While he could buy from John for $100, Alice has come down to $108, which is very close to John's price.  Accepting this offer ensures a deal with Alice and avoids the risk of losing the product if John decides to raise his price."
