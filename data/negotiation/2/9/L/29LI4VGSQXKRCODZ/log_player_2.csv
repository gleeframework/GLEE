"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for a high-quality item. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get the product for even less. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in your product, but $11,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be very happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for the lowest possible price. While $10,750 is closer to his budget than Alice's first offer, he can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  He's already shown his willingness to compromise, and Alice has indicated flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $10,750 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,625.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to finalize the purchase."", ""product_price"": 10625}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm getting closer to your offer, but $10,625 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,687.50. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,687.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,687.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been steadily negotiating a lower price, but Alice's counteroffer of $10,687.50 is still above his maximum budget of $10,000. While there's a chance he could negotiate further, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice and running out of rounds is high.  It's more prudent to secure the product from John at his guaranteed price of $10,000."
