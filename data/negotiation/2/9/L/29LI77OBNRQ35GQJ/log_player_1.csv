"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a significant profit while leaving room for negotiation. This offer is still attractive to Bob, considering his valuation of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I could sell to John for $800,000, I want to see if I can secure a higher price with Bob.  I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $850,000. This price is still significantly profitable for me, but it's a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate. This offer is also closer to Bob's previous offer, suggesting a potential for agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While selling to John would be a guaranteed $800,000, I'm holding out for a better deal with Bob. There's still potential to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

This is my final offer to Bob. It's the minimum I'm willing to accept, as it's equal to what I could get from John.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and accept this offer."
