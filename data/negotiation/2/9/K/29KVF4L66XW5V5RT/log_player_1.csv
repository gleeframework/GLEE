Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is designed to:

* **Maximize profit:** A price of $12,000 is closer to my minimum value of $15,000, potentially netting me more profit than a lower price.
* **Appeal to Bob's value:** While the price is higher than Bob's estimated value, it's still lower than my minimum, giving him potential for a good deal.
* **Maintain John as a backup:** If Bob rejects, I can comfortably sell to John for my minimum value, ensuring I don't lose money."
