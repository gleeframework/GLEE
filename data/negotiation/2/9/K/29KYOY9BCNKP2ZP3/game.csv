"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth $15,000 to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $10,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the effort I've put into acquiring it.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not ready to accept $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $11,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11250.0,Alice,5,
