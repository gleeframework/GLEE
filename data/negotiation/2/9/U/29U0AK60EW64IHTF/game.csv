"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something more in the range of $700000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I would get from the product.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need something closer to my initial offer. How about $850000?  This still gives you a good deal, and it's a price I can accept.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down from your initial offer, but $850000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700000 and $850000. How about $775000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $775000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle one last time.  How about $800000? This is my final offer.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to move on to other options.",800000.0,Alice,5,
