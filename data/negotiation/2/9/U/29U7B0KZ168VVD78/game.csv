"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my minimum selling price and still leaves you a healthy profit margin. Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $1,000,000 for this purchase. Would it be possible for you to lower the price further?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000. This still allows me to make a profit while giving you a significant discount. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort. However, I'm still aiming to keep the cost under $1,000,000. Could you consider reducing the price to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
