"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $11,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to settle a bit lower. Would you be open to $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to squeeze a bit more out of the deal. I understand that you want to get a good price, but I'm not willing to go below $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm counteroffering at $11,250. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11250.0,Alice,5,
