Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy for $1,000,000, Bob values the product at $1,500,000.  We want to get as close to that $1,500,000 as possible.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $1,300,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly."
