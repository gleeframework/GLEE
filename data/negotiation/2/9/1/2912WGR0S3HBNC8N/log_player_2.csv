"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects that while still allowing me to get a good deal. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high. There's plenty of room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $7,000?  I believe that's a fair price that benefits us both."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to anchor the negotiation significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  While it's a bold move, it leaves room for negotiation while staying well below John's $10,000 backup option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to at least get $8,500 for it.  This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let's find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming closer to her actual value, but there's still room for negotiation before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand where you're coming from, Alice. Let's meet in the middle - how about $7,750? That's a significant step from my initial offer and shows I'm serious about finding a compromise."",
""product_price"": 7750
}
```

This counter-offer shows a willingness to negotiate upwards while still aiming for a price significantly lower than both Alice's current offer and John's alternative. It positions the negotiation towards a potential agreement."
