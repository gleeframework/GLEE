Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially worth $1,200,000. To make this a swift deal, I'm willing to offer it at $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to both Alice and Bob, starting with a price slightly below Bob's valuation ($1,150,000) aims to secure a significant profit for Alice.
* **Sense of urgency:**  The ""limited-time offer"" phrasing encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid missing out on a good deal.
* **Backup plan:**  Alice is secure knowing she has John as a guaranteed buyer at her minimum acceptable price, allowing her to confidently negotiate with Bob."
