"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I see the value in the product but $1,100,000 is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While I believe the product is valuable, my budget is pushing me closer to John's offer. Would you consider $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $1,020,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also acknowledging your budget concerns.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
