Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I value your offer,  $1400000 doesn't quite reflect the product's true worth.

Let's see if we can find common ground.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1520000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1580000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a profitable deal for both of us.  Let's aim to finalize this deal in the next round.
