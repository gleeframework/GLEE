"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it has the potential to be extremely valuable for your business. My initial offer is $1800000. I'm confident this is a fair price given the product's unique capabilities.  Let me know your thoughts!",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's potential value to my business.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I value your offer,  $1400000 doesn't quite reflect the product's true worth.  To demonstrate my willingness to work with you, I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while giving you a significant opportunity.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

Thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $1600000. I'm still not convinced that's the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1520000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to my business.,1520000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1520000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1580000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a profitable deal for both of us.  Let's aim to finalize this deal in the next round.",1580000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1580000, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again and offer $1540000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",1540000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but $1540000 is still not quite there for me. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1560000. This is a great price for you, and it also lets me achieve a reasonable outcome. I hope we can reach an agreement in this round.",1560000.0,Alice,7,
