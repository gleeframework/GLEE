Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's potential value to my business.

Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

I'm going to sell the product to John. We're running out of time and I don't think I can get Bob to go higher than $1,520,000. While this is less than my initial target, it's still more than what John is offering.  I'd rather have the guaranteed sale with John than risk losing both deals."
