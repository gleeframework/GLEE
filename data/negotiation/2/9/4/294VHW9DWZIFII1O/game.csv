"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's worth a significant amount to me, but I recognize its value to you as well. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I think the price is a bit too high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This still allows me to recoup a significant portion of the product's value to me, while giving you a good deal.  I'm confident we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
