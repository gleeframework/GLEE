"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth and allows us both to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $850,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet halfway? I'd be willing to accept $1,025,000.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,025,000 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to go up to $950,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  This gives us both some room to negotiate while still staying within a reasonable price range.",950000.0,Bob,4,
