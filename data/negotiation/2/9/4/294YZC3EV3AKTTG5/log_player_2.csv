"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $100. This is an excellent value considering its worth to you is $120. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still within my budget and I can potentially save more money by counter-offering.  I'll see if I can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value proposition, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $90? I'm confident this is still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about I offer the product for $95? It's a bit more than your offer, but still below its value to you. I believe this could be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $95 is a good compromise.  It's still below my maximum budget of $120 and a significant saving compared to John's price.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice rejecting my next counteroffer and pushing the price higher is a risk I'm not willing to take.  $95 is a good deal."
