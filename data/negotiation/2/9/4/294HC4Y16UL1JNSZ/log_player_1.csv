Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a suitable offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your value, also your fallback offer from John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000 
* **Potential Profit for Bob:** $200,000 (if he buys at your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to capture as much of that potential profit as possible without pushing Bob to reject the offer.  

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it can exceed the asking price of $1,150,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,150,000 leaves Bob with a $50,000 potential profit, which is still a strong incentive.
* **Confident Language:** Phrases like ""significant value"" and ""exceed the asking price"" reinforce the product's worth.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message invites Bob to respond and potentially negotiate further, allowing flexibility if needed.

**Important Considerations**

* **Relationship:** If a long-term relationship with Bob is important, you might consider a slightly lower price to ensure a positive experience.
* **Bob's Personality:** If you have insights into Bob's negotiating style (e.g., aggressive or more passive), you can adjust your approach accordingly."
