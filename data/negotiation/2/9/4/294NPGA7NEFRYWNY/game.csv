"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  I think that's fair considering the value of the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, $8,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,5,
