You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you're willing to pay a maximum of $15,000 for the product, and John is offering it for that price, there's no benefit in accepting Alice's offer. You can get the same product for the same price from John. You're trying to save money, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best option."
