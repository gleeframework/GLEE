"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value and unique features, I believe it would greatly benefit your business. Considering its worth to us, I propose a price of $12,000 for this opportunity.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product, given its value to me.  This price is still fair considering the benefits I expect to gain.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to negotiate further. Based on our discussion, I propose to lower the price to $11,500 for the product. This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit while making it more accessible for your budget.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, $11,500 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $11,000.  This would allow both of us to reach an agreement that's mutually beneficial.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually beneficial solution, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to accept $11,250 as the price for the product. This proposal aims to strike a balance between our interests and allows for a successful transaction.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $11,250 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit over my budget. I'm prepared to pay $11,000, which is a fair compromise and allows us to close this deal. Let's finalize this before we run out of time.",11000.0,Bob,6,
