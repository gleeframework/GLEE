"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value and unique features, I believe it would greatly benefit your business. Considering its worth to us, I propose a price of $12,000 for this opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore that space."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product, given its value to me.  This price is still fair considering the benefits I expect to gain."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to negotiate further.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's target price.  There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer keeps the possibility of a better deal open. Bob can counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, $11,500 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $11,000.  This would allow both of us to reach an agreement that's mutually beneficial."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually beneficial solution, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to accept $11,250 as the price for the product. This proposal aims to strike a balance between our interests and allows for a successful transaction.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price, but $11,250 is still above his budget. He can try to push for a lower price, especially since Alice has shown willingness to negotiate.  He might be able to secure a deal closer to his $10,000 goal with another counteroffer."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $11,250 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit over my budget. I'm prepared to pay $11,000, which is a fair compromise and allows us to close this deal. Let's finalize this before we run out of time."", ""product_price"": 11000}
