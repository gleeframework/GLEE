Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's estimated value but gives him room to negotiate. It also sets a clear price point and opens the door for a conversation. If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to counter or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range.  I want to see if I can push Bob a little further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand your position and would like to counter with a proposal of $1,125,000. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer of $1,125,000 is a good compromise. While it's still below my desired price, it's closer to my minimum acceptable value.  It's also likely that continued negotiation will only lead to further concessions on my part. Accepting his offer ensures a quick and relatively favorable sale, avoiding the risk of Bob walking away or me having to settle for John's offer, which is still significantly lower than my initial expectations."
