"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $150.
* Alice's offer is $140, which is a better deal than John's offer of $150.
* However, you can still potentially get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if she'll lower her price."
