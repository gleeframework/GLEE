Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $1,300,000 doesn't quite reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,400,000. How about we split the difference and agree on $1,350,000? This price is fair to both of us, and I'm confident it will be a mutually beneficial agreement.
