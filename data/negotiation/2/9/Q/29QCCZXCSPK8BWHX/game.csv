"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,300,000 for your product. I believe this price reflects its value while also allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $1,300,000 doesn't quite reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,400,000. How about we split the difference and agree on $1,350,000? This price is fair to both of us, and I'm confident it will be a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I've considered your proposal, Alice. While I'm willing to move closer to your original offer, I can't agree to $1,350,000. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,325,000 for your product. I believe this price still allows us to find a balance between the value of the product and what I am willing to pay.",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $1,325,000 is still a bit low, but I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll accept $1,340,000. This is my best offer, and it allows us to reach a fair agreement. If you're not comfortable with this price, I'll have to pursue other options.",1340000.0,Alice,5,

"I've carefully considered your last offer, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this. My final counteroffer is $1,332,500 for your product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the value of the product and what I am willing to pay.",1332500.0,Bob,6,
