Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential profit margin for both of you.
* **One-Shot Deal:** Bob has one chance to accept; this adds pressure on you not to overprice.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's:

* **Above your minimum:**  To maximize your profit.
* **Below Bob's valuation:** To make it attractive for him.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You highlight the product's value and exclusivity.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 leaves you with a $150,000 profit above your guarantee, while still giving Bob a $50,000 discount on his perceived value.
* **Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even if it's just John) creates a sense of urgency for Bob to act.

**Important Note:**  This is just one approach. You could test different price points and messaging depending on your risk tolerance and how you perceive Bob's negotiating style."
