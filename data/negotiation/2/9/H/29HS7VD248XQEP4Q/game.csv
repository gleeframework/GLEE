"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, allowing you to make a good profit while I still get a decent price. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $600,000. Would that work for you?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to at least get $900,000 for the product. This price still allows you to make a profit, and it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That's a fair offer considering my budget.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $750,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, let's go with $850,000. This price gives you a good deal while allowing me to get closer to my minimum. Let's finalize this deal, what do you say?",850000.0,Alice,5,
