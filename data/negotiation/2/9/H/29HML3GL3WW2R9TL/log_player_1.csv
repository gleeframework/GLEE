"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I believe this will encourage Bob to counteroffer and potentially lead to a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $13,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $14,000. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with a price of $13,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate.  I believe this is a fair price that is closer to my target while still being attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's above my minimum acceptable price, I still believe I can get a better deal.  I'm going to counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my desired $13,500.  I want to see if I can find a middle ground before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $13,000.  This is a final attempt to reach a price closer to my desired amount before seriously considering selling to John.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enticing enough for Bob to accept, as it's only $500 less than my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's only $250 less than my minimum acceptable price, and we're running out of rounds.  I'd rather close the deal with Bob at a slightly lower price than risk losing him and being forced to sell to John for an even lower price."
