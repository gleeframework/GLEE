"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $175 is a bit steep for me. How about $140?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand where you're coming from, but I was really hoping to get a bit more for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $160? It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $150? It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is your limit, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I've already given you a great deal by meeting you halfway at $160. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a decent profit. How about we try $155? It's still a good deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",155.0,Alice,5,
