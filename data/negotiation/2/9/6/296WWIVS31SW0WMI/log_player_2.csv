Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still a higher price than Bob would ideally like to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his ideal target of $12,000, but still leaving room for negotiation. Offering $13,000 is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob's serious intent to negotiate while remaining within a reasonable range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $13,800 is still higher than Bob's ideal target.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and gives Bob another opportunity to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground between Alice's offer and his own desired price. Offering $13,500 shows that Bob is serious about closing the deal, but he's still aiming for a price that saves him money.  This counteroffer is likely to be more appealing to Alice than the previous $13,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,700 is a significant step closer to Bob's ideal price.  While it's still higher than what Bob would ideally pay, it's a good compromise.  Continuing to reject offers might result in a lower price, but it could also risk losing the deal altogether.  Accepting this offer saves Bob money and secures the product."
