Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $9,500 is higher than $8,000, giving Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's below my minimum:**  This leaves me room to negotiate downwards if Bob doesn't accept the initial offer.
* **It's a reasonable compromise:** This price offers a potential win-win scenario for both of us.

I'm confident that Bob will either accept this offer or counteroffer, giving me the opportunity to negotiate further. If he rejects the offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or counter-offer again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay $9,000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm aiming for. I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate. By rejecting his offer, I can send a counteroffer and potentially bridge the gap between our desired prices. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price between $9,000 and my minimum of $10,000. This will demonstrate my willingness to negotiate while also maintaining my desired profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  $9,250 is the lowest I can go. This still gives you a great deal on a valuable product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise between Bob's offer and my desired price.  It shows I'm willing to meet him halfway while still maintaining a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer and I'm willing to pay $9,100 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,100 is only $100 away from my minimum acceptable price of $9,000. While it's not my ideal outcome, it's close enough to my goal and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether. 

**Next Steps:**

I will accept Bob's offer and finalize the transaction. This secures a sale close to my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I get a decent return for my product."
