"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000.  This is a strong opening offer that will hopefully get Bob thinking seriously about the value of the product.  I'm confident the product is worth more than $800,000 to me, so I have room to negotiate down if needed.  This also sets a high baseline for any potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $800,000, which is what John is offering.  I will counter with a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm countering with $900,000.  This is still a significant profit for me, and it's a more reasonable price than my initial offer, hopefully making it more appealing to Bob. I'm trying to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's closer to my minimum price, I'm not willing to sell for less than $800,000 at this point. I'm confident I can get a better price with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer to $850,000. This is getting closer to my minimum price, and I'm hoping it will be attractive enough for Bob to accept. We are now only $50,000 apart, and I believe this is a fair offer considering the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $700,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough.  I'm going to counter with a slightly higher offer in the next round. There's still a chance Bob will come up a little more, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $750,000.  This is a compromise,  I'm only $50,000 away from Bob's offer, and I'm hoping this will be enough to close the deal. I'm also considering that John is still waiting to purchase at $800,000, but I want to see if I can get a little more from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're down to the wire, and I'm not confident that I can convince Bob to go any higher.  While $725,000 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum. To avoid potentially losing more money, I'm going to sell to John for $800,000. This ensures I get my minimum price and avoid risking further negotiation."
