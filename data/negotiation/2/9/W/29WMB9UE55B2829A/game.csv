"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $8500 for it, which is a fair price considering my limit. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the value of the product and my budget, I'm offering $9000. This is a fair price and leaves room for us both to walk away satisfied.",9000.0,Bob,4,

Let's split the difference and go with $9150. This allows us to finalize the deal and avoid any further rounds of negotiation.",9150.0,Bob,6,
