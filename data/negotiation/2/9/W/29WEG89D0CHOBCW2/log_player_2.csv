{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $10,000 is above his budget, and he can get the product for less from John.  He should try to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}

Bob should start by making a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price significantly lower than his budget.  $7,000 is a good starting point, leaving room for potential negotiation."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $9,000 is closer to his budget, he still has the option to purchase from John for $8,000. He should continue to negotiate with Alice, aiming to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}

Bob should increase his counteroffer slightly, aiming for a middle ground. $7,500 represents a compromise between his initial offer and Alice's latest offer. This approach shows Alice he is willing to negotiate but remains committed to getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $8,500 is close to his budget, he can still get the product from John for $8,000.  He should continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}

Bob should now offer $8,000, which is his maximum budget and the same price John is selling the product for. This puts the pressure on Alice to either accept or reject, potentially leading to a further counteroffer from her side."
