Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $19,000 offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but also gives you space to potentially negotiate down if needed.
* **Confident Tone:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value without directly referencing Bob's potential lower valuation.

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob might reject this offer outright. However, it's a calculated risk to potentially gain an extra $4,000. If Bob rejects, you still have your fallback option with John."
