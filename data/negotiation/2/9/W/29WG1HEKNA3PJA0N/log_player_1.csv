This offer starts at a price higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. It's also important to be friendly and encouraging to make Bob feel like a valued customer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $6,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we go with $7500?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

$7,500 is still below my minimum, but I'm not ready to give up on Bob yet. I'll make one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a deal."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I respect that. But $7,500 is still below my minimum.  Let's be fair.  I'm willing to come down to $7,800. This is a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to sell the product without losing too much.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 7800}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go as low as $7200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200

While I'm tempted to continue negotiating with Bob, I've already made several concessions and am getting closer to my minimum price. At this point, I'm better off selling to John for $8,000. It's a guaranteed sale and I'll avoid the risk of Bob continuing to lowball me."
