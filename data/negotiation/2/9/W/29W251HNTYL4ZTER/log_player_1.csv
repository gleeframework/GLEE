"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 18000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my minimum. I'm also aiming for a quick sale, hoping Bob won't need too many rounds to come closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is better than nothing, I'm still aiming for more. It's only round 2, and I have 8 more rounds to negotiate. I'm confident I can get closer to my minimum of $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $16,000, still above Bob's offer but closer to his valuation. This demonstrates flexibility while still trying to get a price closer to my desired minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $13,500 is closer to my desired minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. It's only round 4, and I still have several rounds left to negotiate. I'm confident I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000} 
```

I'm finally offering my minimum price of $15,000. Bob has shown a willingness to pay more than his initial valuation, and with only 5 rounds left, I'm hoping this is a price he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although Bob is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still going to reject his offer. I have 4 rounds left and I'm hoping I can get a better deal by holding out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $14,500,  which is still slightly above Bob's offer, but shows I'm willing to negotiate. It's a compromise that acknowledges Bob's willingness to increase his offer. With only three rounds left, it's important to make concessions while trying to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's round 8, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum. While I could keep negotiating, the risk of not closing a deal is increasing.  With only two rounds left, I'm not confident that Bob will meet my price. It's time to sell to John and guarantee myself my minimum desired price."
