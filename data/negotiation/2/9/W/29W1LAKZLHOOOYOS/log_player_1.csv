Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

Here's why I chose this offer:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  A price of $1,000,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than my floor price of $800,000, meaning a larger profit for me.
* **Appealing to Bob:** While Bob values the product at $1,200,000, offering $1,000,000 is still a good deal for him. It's a $200,000 gain, and he likely won't find a better price elsewhere.
* **Mitigating Risk:** If Bob rejects the offer, I have a guaranteed backup buyer (John) at $800,000. This minimizes the risk of losing out on a sale completely. 

This offer balances my desire for a higher price with the need to make the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
