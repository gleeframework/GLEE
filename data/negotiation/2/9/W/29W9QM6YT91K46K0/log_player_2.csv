"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by its previous owners. Given its quality and the benefits it provides, I believe it's worth $100. Would you like to make this valuable addition to your collection? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message is persuasive, she's offering the product at her maximum value. There's no discount being offered.  Since you know John will sell it for the same price, there's no harm in rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if John might give you a better deal."
