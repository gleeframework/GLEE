"Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate it. However,  $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this moment. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its worth to me and your desired selling price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that our product is worth more to you than you're offering. Considering your willingness to pay $1,250,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $1,275,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.
