Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that our product is worth more to you than you're offering. Considering your willingness to pay $1,250,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $1,275,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think?

* Alice has moved closer to your desired price point, offering $1,275,000. 
* This price is still within your budget and only $25,000 higher than your last counteroffer.
* It's likely you can't negotiate much further and still secure a deal, and buying from John would cost significantly more.  
* Accepting the offer ensures you get the product while minimizing your overall cost."
