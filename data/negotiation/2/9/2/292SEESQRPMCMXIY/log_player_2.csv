Round 2

{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1010000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is taking a more subtle approach this round. He's incrementally increasing his offer, showing he's willing to budge a bit but still maintaining a firm stance. $1,010,000 is a small increase from his previous offer but still significantly lower than Alice's latest price. This demonstrates that Bob is committed to finding a mutually beneficial agreement."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While it's still above his target price, he's already been negotiating for several rounds and is getting closer to his target. He only has 3 rounds left, and continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better price, especially considering he can always buy from John. At this point, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice to secure the product while minimizing the risk of losing out on a good deal."
