"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $15000 is at the upper limit of my budget. I'd be interested in purchasing if you were willing to come down to $12000.  This would allow me to comfortably afford the product and would likely make the deal much faster.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13500. This is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13500.0,Alice,3,
