"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you.  I believe it holds significant value for your operations. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  This takes into account its unique advantages and potential for growth."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're aiming for the highest possible price. Starting significantly above both your minimum and Bob's perceived value creates negotiation space. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and potential, subtly justifying the high price without revealing your hand.
* **Leaving Room:**  This offer allows for substantial negotiation downwards while staying well above your $1,500,000 walk-away point.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree that the product has value, your asking price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to offer $600,000 to start the negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below your minimum acceptable price. While his counter-offer was expected, accepting $600,000 would be a substantial loss. We'll proceed to the next round and attempt to negotiate a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities. I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet in the middle. How about $1,900,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, But Still Strong:** We've made a substantial reduction from the initial offer to show flexibility. However, the new price is still significantly above both Bob's offer and your minimum.
* **Justification:** We haven't provided specific reasons for the high price, maintaining a sense of the product's premium value.
* **""Meeting in the Middle"":** This framing encourages Bob to make a more substantial move upward in the next round.

We are moving towards a more realistic price point while still aiming high. Let's see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget.  I can go up to $700,000.  I believe this is a fair offer, considering my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is slowly increasing, but it's still far below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It seems like Bob is trying to negotiate a bargain, and while we want to be flexible, we can't sell ourselves short.  We'll continue negotiating and see if we can bring him closer to a reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  To be completely transparent, I have a hard minimum of $1,500,000 for this product. Considering its true value, I believe this is more than fair.  Would you be willing to meet me at this price?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Transparency and Firmness:** It's time to be upfront about your minimum price. This shows Bob you're serious and limits further lowball offers.
* **Justification:** We're reiterating the product's value while framing your minimum as a fair compromise.
* **Direct Approach:**  We're directly asking Bob if he'll meet your price, making the next step clear.

By laying out your bottom line, we're putting the ball in Bob's court.  Let's see his response."
