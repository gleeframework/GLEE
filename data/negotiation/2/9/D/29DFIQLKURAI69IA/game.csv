"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you.  I believe it holds significant value for your operations. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  This takes into account its unique advantages and potential for growth.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree that the product has value, your asking price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to offer $600,000 to start the negotiation.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities. I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet in the middle. How about $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget.  I can go up to $700,000.  I believe this is a fair offer, considering my budget constraints.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  To be completely transparent, I have a hard minimum of $1,500,000 for this product. Considering its true value, I believe this is more than fair.  Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",1500000.0,Alice,5,
