"Hi Bob, I'm excited to present you with this opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,100,000. I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations, and I'm open to discussing the details further.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in this product,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This is my final offer, as I already have another buyer interested at a higher price.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,025,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go to $900,000, which reflects the value I see in the product.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
