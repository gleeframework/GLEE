"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this fantastic product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer of $140 is far too high. You know you can get the product for $80 from John, which is within your budget."
