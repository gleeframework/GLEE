"Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. This is a better deal than accepting Alice's offer of $850,000.  It's worth rejecting Alice's offer and trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  Starting with a counteroffer of $750,000 is a reasonable starting point. This is significantly lower than Alice's offer of $850,000, but still above Alice's minimum value of $800,000. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing Bob to potentially get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $825,000 is lower than John's price of $1,000,000.
* This is a good deal for Bob as it allows him to buy the product for a lower price than John. 
* While there's always the possibility of negotiating a lower price with Alice, it's not worth the risk of her rejecting a counteroffer and potentially driving the price up. 
* Accepting this offer is the most efficient way to secure the product for a reasonable price."
