"Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The goal is to save as much money as possible. While $500,000 is a good deal, it's still possible to get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore potentially lower prices."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a significant counteroffer, aiming to gauge Alice's true willingness to sell. A price of $300,000 is a substantial discount from her initial offer, and it's likely to either push her to accept or provide a better counteroffer closer to a reasonable midpoint."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer, but $400,000 is still a significant amount of money.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and trying to get a lower price. It's possible to push Alice further down, or at least determine her true lower limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's current offer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial goal.  $350,000 is a reasonable midpoint, and it increases the pressure on Alice to either accept or come back with a final offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my last offer, and $450,000 is a significant savings compared to the $1,000,000 price from John. While further negotiation might be possible, it's not guaranteed to yield a better result, and the risk of losing the deal with Alice entirely increases with each round. Accepting the current offer ensures I get the product at a good price."
