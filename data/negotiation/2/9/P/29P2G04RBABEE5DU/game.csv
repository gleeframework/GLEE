"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1100000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1250000?  This is still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but $1150000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000, which is the absolute minimum I can accept. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
