Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary while still aiming for a significantly higher profit than John's offer.  I'll be prepared to counter Bob's offers, keeping in mind my minimum value of $1,500,000 and trying to gauge Bob's interest and budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round.  I'll try to understand why he made such a low offer and counter with a more reasonable price that reflects the value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,750,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it still allows me to make a substantial profit.  This counter-offer shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I also want to make sure I'm not undervaluing the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price. While I would have preferred to earn more, accepting his offer ensures I get the best possible deal with Bob. There's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer in the future, and the risk of continuing to negotiate is not worth the potential loss of a sale."
