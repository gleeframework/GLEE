"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $115. This is a good starting point as it's a bit more than my minimum price of $100, but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a price closer to my ideal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is still above my minimum price of $100, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John.  It's also getting closer to my desired price, so I'm accepting his offer."
