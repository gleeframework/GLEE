"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $700,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $650,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $650,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $675,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let me know what you think.",675000.0,Alice,3,
