"Round 1

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not worth it to buy from Alice at $14,000 when you can get it from John for $12,000.  Let's see if we can get Alice to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm offering $11,000, which is still above my max budget but lower than Alice's initial offer.  Hopefully, this shows I'm serious about buying, but I'm also not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but it's still too high.  I'll keep trying to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm willing to compromise, but still well below her offer.  Hopefully, she'll meet me in the middle this time."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to my price, but I'm still going to try and negotiate a bit more.  I think there's room for her to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

This is my final offer. It's my maximum budget, and if she doesn't accept, I'll just buy from John."
