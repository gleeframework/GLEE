{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a significant investment, but I believe the value it holds for you justifies the price.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above my minimum of $800,000 but significantly lower than the $1,500,000 value to Bob. It leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows for a profitable deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I want to see if I can push him higher before accepting or resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $900,000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price reflects a significant discount for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
