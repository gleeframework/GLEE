"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $900,000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price reflects a significant discount for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
