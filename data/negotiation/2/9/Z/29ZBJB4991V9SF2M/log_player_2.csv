"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering the value it holds for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better deal than John's $15,000, Bob can potentially get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price to make a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $13,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $13,500. This is my final offer, as I'm also considering selling it to John for $12,000. Let me know what you decide. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $13,500.** This is better than John's price of $15,000.
* **Alice's final offer** means that she won't go lower, and Bob risks losing the deal entirely if he rejects.
* **Buying from John is more expensive.**  

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice to maximize savings."
