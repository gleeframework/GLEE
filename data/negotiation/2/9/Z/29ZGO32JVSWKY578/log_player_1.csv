Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to other potential buyers. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it at a price of $1,350,000."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000,  there's a chance to earn even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offered price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still offers a substantial discount compared to what John is willing to pay. 
* **""Exclusive Opportunity"" Framing:**  This creates a sense of urgency and potential loss for Bob if he doesn't act.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** I make a profit of $550,000 (significantly more than selling to John).
* **Bob Rejects:** I sell to John at my guaranteed price of $1,500,000.

This strategy aims to find a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a successful sale."
