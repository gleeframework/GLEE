"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $25,000 is well above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, given its value to me. This is my best offer, but I'm open to discussing a compromise.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to let it go for $20,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product.",20000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $20,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $15,000, which is my absolute maximum.  I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",15000.0,Bob,4,
