"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $25,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 25000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $25,000 is well above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, given its value to me. This is my best offer, but I'm open to discussing a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is quite low.  While it's tempting to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John, there's still room for negotiation with Bob.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to let it go for $20,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $20,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $15,000, which is my absolute maximum.  I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob has now met my baseline price. There's no point in continuing the negotiation.
