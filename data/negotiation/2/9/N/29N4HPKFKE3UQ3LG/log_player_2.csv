"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $25,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $25,000 is far above his budget, and he can get the product for less from John or potentially negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $25,000 is well above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, given its value to me. This is my best offer, but I'm open to discussing a compromise."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to let it go for $20,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $20,000 is closer to his budget, it's still above his ideal price. He can try to negotiate further with Alice or buy the product from John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $20,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $15,000, which is my absolute maximum.  I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 15000}
