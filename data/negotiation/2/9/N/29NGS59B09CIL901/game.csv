"Hi Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a competitive price. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your product, $12000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8000 for it.  This is my top offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price given the value I place on the product.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is your top offer, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10500. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking to my original offer of $8000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, Bob, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9500. This is a compromise that takes into account your original offer and my original price. I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. However, $9500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering my previous offer and your willingness to negotiate.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this point.",8500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're willing to pay $8500, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $9000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,7,
