"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000.  This price reflects the value I believe it holds for you as well. Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but my budget is limited. Would you consider lowering the price to $950,000? I believe this would still reflect the product's worth while allowing me to stay within my financial constraints.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still allows me to make a profit while acknowledging your budget constraints. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I appreciate the effort to meet somewhere in the middle. However, I'm still unable to commit to $1,050,000. Would you consider $1,025,000? I believe this might be a fair compromise that still leaves room for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
