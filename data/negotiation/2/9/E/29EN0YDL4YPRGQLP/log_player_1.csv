Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you bringing this product to my attention. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to offer $12,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our interests. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
