"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering the value it will bring you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good price, it's still higher than the product's value to Alice. There's room for negotiation to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you bringing this product to my attention. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to offer $12,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our interests. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective.  While I'm aiming for a higher price point, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This reflects the product's true value and represents a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to Bob's target:** $13,000 is significantly closer to Bob's maximum budget of $15,000 compared to Alice's previous offer of $14,000. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might walk away or counter with a higher price.
* **Time and effort:** Continuing to negotiate might take more time and effort without guaranteeing a significantly better price.

By accepting the offer, Bob secures the product for a price that is within his budget and represents a good deal, considering the product's value to Alice."
