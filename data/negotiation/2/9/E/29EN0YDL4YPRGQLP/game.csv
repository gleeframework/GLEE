"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you bringing this product to my attention. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to offer $12,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our interests. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective.  While I'm aiming for a higher price point, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This reflects the product's true value and represents a fair compromise for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,
