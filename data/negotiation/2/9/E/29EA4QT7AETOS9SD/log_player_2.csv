"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be really valuable to you. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a better price than John's $150, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get the product for closer to his desired price range by rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you consider $130? "", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $130 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $135?  It's still a good deal for you, considering the value you'll get from this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $135, which is within Bob's budget of $150 and is a better deal than buying from John.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might reject another counteroffer and he'd be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  It's best to accept the offer and secure the product for a reasonable price."
