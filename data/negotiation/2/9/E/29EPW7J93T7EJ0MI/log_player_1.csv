"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $12,000.  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my minimum of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $14,000 is closer to my minimum, I still have room to negotiate and potentially get a higher price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}

I'm offering $16,000. This is still above Bob's offer, but it's a significant step down from my initial offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is close to my minimum, I'm still going to reject Bob's offer.  I think I can still squeeze out a bit more in the next round. I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not desperate to close a deal with Bob at this point."

```

Although Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm going to reject it.  I'm hoping to get a slightly better price by continuing the negotiation.  I'm also aware that I can sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not feeling pressured to close a deal with Bob right now."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm dropping my price a bit more to $14,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm serious about making a deal. I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept or at least come closer to my offer.  However, I'm starting to feel the pressure, as I'm running out of rounds."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  I've reached a point where I'm not confident I can get a better price from Bob, and I'm running out of rounds.  John's offer of $15,000 is my minimum, and I'm happy to close the deal with him."
