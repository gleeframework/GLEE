# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product! After considering your interest, I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
