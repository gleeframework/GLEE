It's always good to try and negotiate a better price. You can likely get the product for lower than $7,500, and you have 9 more rounds to do so."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000.

Alice's offer is now the same as John's. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice, as you're unlikely to get a better price and you're wasting rounds.  It's time to secure the product from John."
