"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in something that will bring you a lot of value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $820,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",820000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $820,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would that be workable for you?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a good return on my investment. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $790,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",790000.0,Alice,5,
