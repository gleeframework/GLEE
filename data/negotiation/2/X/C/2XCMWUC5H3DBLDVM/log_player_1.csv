Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. I'm asking for $1,600,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

Here's why this approach is strategic:

* **Aiming High:** Starting with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($1,600,000 vs. $1,200,000) leaves room for negotiation and potential profit maximization.
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value without revealing your bottom line. This allows Bob to see the potential benefit while justifying the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is polite and invites Bob's input, implying a willingness to negotiate. 

Remember, you have a strong fallback position with John, so there's no harm in aiming high with Bob."
