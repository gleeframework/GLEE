"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's too low. I'm still willing to negotiate with him, but I need to make sure I get a price closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $8,500 to make this worthwhile.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $8,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get a bit more, Bob's offer of $8,000 is right on the line with what John is offering. Given that I have 10 rounds to close the deal, I don't want to risk losing out on both deals by continuing to negotiate with Bob. I'll accept John's offer and sell the product to him."
