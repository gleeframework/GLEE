"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe could be extremely valuable to your business.  While I can't disclose all the details right now, I can assure you it's worth at least $1200000 to me. I'm willing to let you have it for a price that I believe is fair for both of us. Would you be interested in discussing a potential sale at $1500000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum budget. You know you can get the same product from John for the same price. There's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. Rejecting and buying from John gives you the same product at the same price, which is the most financially advantageous option."
