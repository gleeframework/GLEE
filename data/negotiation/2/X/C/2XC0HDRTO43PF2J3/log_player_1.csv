"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its market value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than selling to John,  I can still potentially get closer to my target of $14,000. There's room to negotiate, and I'm confident I can get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $12,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $12,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm still close to my target price of $14,000 and I have a few rounds left. There's potential to get a better price, so I'll reject this offer and counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is still a bit too low. How about $13,500? It's a fair compromise and we can close the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not comfortable with $13,500, as it's still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $13,000. This is my final offer, so please let me know if you can accept it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is close to my target of $14,000 and is significantly better than selling to John for $10,000.  I have only four rounds left, and it's unlikely I'll get a significantly better offer from Bob. It's time to close the deal and secure a good price."
