Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $90. How about $100? It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $95? It's a compromise that still gives me a decent profit, and I think it's a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
