"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $12,750?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit.",12750.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to make a fair profit, but $12,750 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,250. Can you consider this compromise?",12250.0,Bob,4,
