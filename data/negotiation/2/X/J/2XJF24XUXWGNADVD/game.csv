"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from your initial price.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's a fair price for me, and I'm confident you'll still make a significant profit.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
