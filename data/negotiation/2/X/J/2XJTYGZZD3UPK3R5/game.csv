"Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you this incredible product! It's something truly special, and I know you'll appreciate its value.  I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This reflects the product's unique qualities and the potential it holds for you.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Can you consider this offer?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $800,000 just doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my initial price.  I'm offering you the product for $1,050,000.  This price still gives you a good deal and allows me to get closer to what I need.  Let's find a way to make this work for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value you're offering. Can you consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $900,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to compromise further. I'm offering you the product for $950,000.  This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this price.

"Bob,  I appreciate your persistence in trying to find a price that works for both of us. However,  $920,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again.
