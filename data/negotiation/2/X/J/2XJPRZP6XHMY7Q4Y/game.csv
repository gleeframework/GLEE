"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  I believe it's a fair offer considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to be closer to my value for this product. How about $1,250,000? This would give us both a fair deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,250,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more in the $1,100,000 range. Would you be open to that?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a better price, but $1,100,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be closer to $1,200,000.  How about $1,150,000? It's a compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
