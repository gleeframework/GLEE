"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $100. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $100.**  This is within your budget of $120.
* **Buying from John costs $120.** This is more expensive than Alice's offer.

It makes more sense to accept Alice's offer and save $20."
