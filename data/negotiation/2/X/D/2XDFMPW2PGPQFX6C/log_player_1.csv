"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000.  It's a unique opportunity with a lot of potential. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point for negotiation. It is above your minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.  It also signals that you believe the product is worth more than $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer meets your minimum value, it's important to remember your goal is to maximize your earnings. Accepting this offer would be the same as selling to John, and you want to see if you can get more from Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a higher price and potentially get closer to your desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective on the price, $1,200,000 is significantly below what it's worth to me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This reflects the product's true value and gives you a good price. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1250000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial offer and closer to your minimum value, it's still below what you believe the product is worth.  You have more rounds of negotiation left, so you can continue trying to get a better price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  I'm going to come down a bit more to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price for the product, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1300000. I'm willing to offer $1220000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Bob is showing interest in the product and continuing to negotiate, his offer is still below your minimum value. It's closer to what John would pay, but you're still aiming for a higher price.  You have a few rounds left to try and get closer to your desired value. Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiations open and allows you to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and it gives you a great deal. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1275000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to accepting, but I still think I can get a better deal. I'm willing to offer $1200000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is exactly the same as what John is offering.  You have only two rounds of negotiation left. Given Bob's persistence in staying at a lower price, it's unlikely you'll be able to reach a higher agreement within these remaining rounds. It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John rather than risk ending up with the same amount after more rounds of negotiation with Bob."
