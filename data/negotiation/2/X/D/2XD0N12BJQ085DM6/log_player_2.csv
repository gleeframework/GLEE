Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $75. I'll offer it to you for $95, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly unwilling to budge below $90, and her latest offer of $95 is still above your maximum budget and John's offer. It's unlikely she'll come down significantly in the remaining rounds. To ensure you get the product within your budget, it's time to cut your losses and go with John's guaranteed offer of $80."
