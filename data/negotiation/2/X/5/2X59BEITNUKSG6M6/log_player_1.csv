"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a real game-changer, and I think it would be a great asset for your business.  I'm asking $1,800,000 for it. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $1,800,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the product's potential benefits for Bob to make it more appealing. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  I express willingness to discuss the price, suggesting I'm open to finding a mutually agreeable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I believe I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation.  

I will proceed to the next round and counter Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  While $1,200,000 is tempting, it's still a bit below what I need to make this work.  How about we split the difference and meet at $1,500,000?  It's a fair price considering the product's value and your potential returns."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's offer:** I show respect by acknowledging his counteroffer and expressing appreciation for his interest.
* **Justify my counteroffer:** I explain that while I appreciate the offer, it's too low for my needs. I then propose a compromise at $1,500,000, highlighting its fairness.
* **Focus on value:** I emphasize the potential returns Bob can expect from the product to make my price more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000. How about we try $1,350,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 

I believe I can still push for a better deal, considering John is willing to pay my minimum.  I'll continue negotiating with Bob for now, as I'm still within my 10 round limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me.  This product is truly unique and offers exceptional value. To be honest, I'm also considering another offer at $1,500,000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we meet at $1,450,000? It's a fair compromise that respects both of our positions."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Increase pressure:** I subtly remind Bob of the alternative offer I have, adding pressure for him to negotiate.
* **Maintain flexibility:** I reiterate my desire to work with Bob but emphasize that I need a price that's closer to my desired value.
* **Final compromise:** I propose a final compromise at $1,450,000, showing willingness to meet halfway while still achieving a price I'm comfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,350,000 and $1,450,000. How about we try $1,400,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,400,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still hesitant to accept it.  I'm only two rounds away from selling to John for $1,500,000, and I'm not sure if I can convince Bob to go higher. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,400,000. It's just a little too low. I'm willing to give you one last offer.  If you're serious about this deal, we can meet in the middle at $1,425,000.  This is my final offer, and if we can't agree, I'll have to move forward with another buyer."", ""product_price"": 1425000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Finality:** I emphasize that this is my final offer, creating a sense of urgency and pushing Bob to make a decision.
* **Compromise:** I offer a slight compromise at $1,425,000, demonstrating flexibility while still staying above my minimum.
* **Consequence:** I clearly state that if the offer is not accepted, I will move forward with John. This creates a stronger incentive for Bob to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that this is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has not budged from his offer of $1,400,000, and I'm only two rounds away from having to sell to John.  While I'd prefer to work with Bob, I'm not willing to settle for a price below my minimum. John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, so it's the better option at this point.  I'll accept John's offer and move on."
