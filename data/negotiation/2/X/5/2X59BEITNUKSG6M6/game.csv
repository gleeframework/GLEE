"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  While $1,200,000 is tempting, it's still a bit below what I need to make this work.  How about we split the difference and meet at $1,500,000?  It's a fair price considering the product's value and your potential returns.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000. How about we try $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me.  This product is truly unique and offers exceptional value. To be honest, I'm also considering another offer at $1,500,000. However, I'd prefer to work with you if we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we meet at $1,450,000? It's a fair compromise that respects both of our positions.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,350,000 and $1,450,000. How about we try $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,400,000. It's just a little too low. I'm willing to give you one last offer.  If you're serious about this deal, we can meet in the middle at $1,425,000.  This is my final offer, and if we can't agree, I'll have to move forward with another buyer.",1425000.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I understand that this is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price?",1400000.0,Bob,8,
