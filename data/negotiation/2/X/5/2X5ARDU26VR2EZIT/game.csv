"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $2,000,000 is outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is still a good price considering its potential. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true market value. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the potential returns.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
