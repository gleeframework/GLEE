"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $9,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we split the difference again and settle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $9,750. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll sell the product to you for $10,250. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
