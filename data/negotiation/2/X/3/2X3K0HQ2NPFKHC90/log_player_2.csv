{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $11,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm willing to pay $10,500. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a moderate counteroffer.** This shows you're serious about buying but still want a good deal. 
* **Leave room for further negotiation.**  There are still 8 rounds left, so you can adjust your offer if needed.
* **Be polite and positive.** Maintaining a good relationship with Alice might be helpful if you need to make further concessions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,800. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $10,800 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go to $10,200.  This would allow me to make the purchase and it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product."", ""product_price"": 10200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increase your offer slightly.** You've shown Alice you're serious about buying, and this small increase demonstrates your willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on the value of the product.** By emphasizing the value both of you see, you appeal to Alice's sense of fairness and potentially make her more amenable to your offer.
* **Stay within your budget.** $10,200 is still within your maximum price point, but it leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $10,200 is a significant discount, but I still need to make a profit. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but only if you're willing to throw in some additional services that will enhance the product's functionality. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your budget.** While $10,500 is getting closer, you're aiming for $10,000 or less.
* **The added services are a potential dealbreaker.**  You haven't agreed to any extra services, and adding them could change the value proposition of the product for you.
* **You're still in a good negotiating position.** There are 5 rounds remaining, giving you enough time to see if you can get a better price without the added services.

By rejecting the offer, you signal to Alice that you're not willing to accept any additional costs. You can then try to negotiate a lower price without the extra services in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,500 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm not interested in any additional services at this time. I'm confident I can maximize the product's functionality on my own. To make this deal work, I'm willing to go up to $10,300 for the product as is.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 10300} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmly decline the additional services.** You've stated your preference and show you're not willing to budge on this point.
* **Raise your offer slightly.**  A small increase shows commitment while leaving room for a potential compromise.
* **Declare it your final offer.** This puts pressure on Alice to make a decision and encourages her to accept.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $10,300, but I'm still not convinced that's enough. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to know that you're serious about this deal. I'll offer you the product for $10,400, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's final offer is still above your budget.** While it's a good deal, you're aiming for $10,000 or less. 
* **You're running out of time.** With only 3 rounds remaining, there's a high chance you won't be able to negotiate a lower price. 
* **You have a guaranteed option.** Buying from John guarantees you the product at your desired price.

Since you have a reliable alternative, it's better to secure the product at your target price rather than risk continuing negotiations and potentially losing out on the deal altogether."
