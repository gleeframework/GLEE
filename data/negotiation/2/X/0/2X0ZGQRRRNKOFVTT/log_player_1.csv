Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $150. I believe it will be highly valuable for you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** While not essential, hinting at the product's value can make the price more palatable.  
* **Leaving the Door Open:** By asking ""What do you think?"", we invite Bob to engage in the conversation, potentially leading to a sale.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Value:** We know the product is worth $120 to Bob. Offering it at $150 gives him an incentive to negotiate but might also lead to an immediate rejection. 
* **John as Backup:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John, acting as a safety net. This knowledge allows us to be a bit bolder with our initial offer to Bob."
