{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $100. It's not worth accepting. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

You're starting at your maximum budget of $100. This is a clear indication that you're serious about buying the product but are only willing to pay what it's worth to you. It's a bold opening move, and it will give Alice some room to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above your budget. While you could continue negotiating, it's clear that Alice is unwilling to go lower than $150. Since you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $100, it's the most sensible choice to avoid further negotiation and secure the product at your desired price."
