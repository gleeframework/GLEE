"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a decent starting point, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $11,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $10,500. Would that be possible?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get as close to your target as possible. However, I'm still not willing to go below $12,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I can offer the product to you for $12,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",12200.0,Alice,5,
