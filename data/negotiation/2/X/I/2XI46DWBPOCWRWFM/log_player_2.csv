# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll be interested. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $950,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm now offering the product to you for $875000. This is my final compromise for this round. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum. There's room to negotiate further, and rejecting this offer gives you another chance to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $825,000, which is a significant step closer to your previous offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $825000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $850000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $800,000. Although it's tempting to accept since it's getting closer, you have the option to buy from John for a lower price.  Rejecting this offer allows you to make a final counteroffer and see if you can reach a deal that works for both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay my absolute maximum of $800,000 for this product. If you can accept this price, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll unfortunately have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you've reached your maximum budget, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I've already considered selling the product to another interested buyer, John, for $800000. I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet my target. I'll offer it to you for $825000, but this is my absolute final offer. If you can meet me at this price, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's final offer is still above your maximum budget of $800,000. You know that John is willing to sell the product for $800,000, which is the best price you can get. Therefore, it makes sense to buy the product from John and avoid further negotiation."
