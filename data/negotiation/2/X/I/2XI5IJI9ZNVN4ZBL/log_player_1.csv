"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm thinking closer to $700,000 would be more reasonable.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  While $875,000 is closer, I'm still a little ways off. How about we settle at $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob is still significantly undervaluing the product. It's worth holding out for a better offer as we're still above John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to see some movement on your end as well. How about $825,000?"", ""product_price"": 825000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm prepared to offer $780,000 to reach a final agreement.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000.

While Bob is getting closer to our minimum, we're only $20,000 away from John's offer. With 4 rounds left, we still have room to negotiate and aim higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, your offer is getting closer to what I had in mind. To be fair, I'm willing to accept $810,000 as my final offer. This is a very competitive price for a product of this value."", ""product_price"": 810000} 
``` 

We're pushing a little closer to Bob's offer, but still aiming for a price that's a good amount above John's offer. This creates a sense of urgency and positions this as a final offer, encouraging Bob to accept."
