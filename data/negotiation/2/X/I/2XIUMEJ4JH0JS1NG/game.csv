"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested in the product,  $1,000,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I can't go as low as $850,000. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $950,000. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $900,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, and $900,000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $975,000. Let me know if that's a price you're willing to pay.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $975,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm going to make one final offer. I'm willing to pay $925,000 for the product.  This is the absolute highest I can go.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to go with another option.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty and willingness to make a final offer. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $975,000 and $925,000, which would be $950,000. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. If you're still interested, let's finalize the deal at $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,7,
