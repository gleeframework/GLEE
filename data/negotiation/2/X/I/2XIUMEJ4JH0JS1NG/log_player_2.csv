# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to accept Alice's offer. The product is worth $1,200,000 to her, and she's offering it for $1,000,000.  There's room for negotiation to bring the price down closer to my $800,000 limit."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I can't go as low as $850,000. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $950,000. Let me know if that's more to your liking.

Alice is coming down, but I'm still not ready to accept. I need to keep pushing for a lower price.  I'm going to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $900,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, and $900,000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $975,000. Let me know if that's a price you're willing to pay. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to get as much as possible, and $975,000 is still above my budget. I'm going to make one more counteroffer.  If she rejects it, I'll buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $975,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm going to make one final offer. I'm willing to pay $925,000 for the product.  This is the absolute highest I can go.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to go with another option."", ""product_price"": 925000}

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty and willingness to make a final offer. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $925,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $975,000 and $925,000, which would be $950,000. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. If you're still interested, let's finalize the deal at $950,000.
