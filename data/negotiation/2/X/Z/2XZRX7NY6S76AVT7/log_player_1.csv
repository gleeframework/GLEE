"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 15000}

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I want to see if I can push him a bit higher before considering selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}

I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still above Bob's offer. I'm aiming to meet halfway, hoping to close the deal without risking too much by going too low."

I'm counteroffering at $12,500. I'm trying to meet Bob halfway again. This is a  fair price considering we are both getting closer to our desired price points. It's a good opportunity to close the deal before risking losing to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum, but I'm running out of time. With only two rounds left, I'm not confident that I can push him any higher.  To avoid risking ending up with a lower price or no sale at all, I'm going to accept John's offer of $10,000.  It's not my ideal price, but it guarantees a sale and secures my minimum desired value."
