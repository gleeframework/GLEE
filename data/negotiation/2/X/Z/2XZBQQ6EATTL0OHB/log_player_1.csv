{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value of the product, giving him some room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a profit.  If Bob rejects, I can then make a counteroffer or simply sell to John for the guaranteed $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $15,500 for the product. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $500 more than what I can get from John. I'm going to try to squeeze a little more out of Bob before I accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,500.  This is a good price for both of us, and I think it's fair considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 16500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $16,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is only $1,000 less than my initial offer and $1,000 more than what I can get from John.  I'm going to accept this offer and avoid any further negotiation."
