Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum of $15,000.
* **It's reasonable:** The price is not outrageous, considering the product is worth $15,000 to Bob.  
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can adjust the price if Bob makes a counteroffer.

Remember, you have John as a backup buyer, so you're not pressured to accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $17,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14,500. This is a fair price considering I'm willing to buy it from you and the value it holds for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below your minimum, and while you could accept it and make a small profit, you can potentially do better. By rejecting his offer, you can:

* **Set a firmer price:** Show Bob that you're not willing to settle for his low price.
* **Explore higher offers:** You might be able to get closer to your desired price by making a counteroffer.
* **Maintain leverage:** You have John as a backup buyer, giving you the power to walk away if negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find a price we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $15,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $15,500 is above your minimum of $15,000 and it's a fair compromise considering you initially asked for $17,000.  It's a good time to accept the offer and finalize the deal.  While you might be able to get a slightly higher price with further negotiation, there's a risk that Bob could walk away, and you'd only be left with John's offer of $15,000."
