Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too rich for me. I'm thinking closer to $60.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is too low for me. This product is really high-quality and I'm confident it's worth more. How about we meet in the middle at $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a good product Alice, but I have a strict budget. Could you do $75? That's a fair offer.

You have three options:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $75.  This product is worth a lot to me. Would you be willing to consider $100? That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 100}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. I can go up to $80, but that's absolutely my limit. It's a good deal for that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to meet a price that's significantly better than what John is offering.  Cutting your losses and taking the guaranteed $150 is the smarter move."
