"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer of $10,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.
* There are still 9 rounds left, providing opportunities to negotiate a lower price.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting the offer, Bob can initiate a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob wants to save as much money as possible.
*  A counteroffer of $9,000 is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still potentially profitable for her. 
* This allows for further negotiation and the possibility of finding a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $9,500 is within Bob's budget of $12,000 and represents a significant saving compared to John's price of $12,000.
* While further negotiation is possible, the risk of Alice rejecting subsequent offers increases, and there's no guarantee that a better price will be achieved. 
* Accepting the offer secures a product for Bob at a good price and avoids potential delays or the need to buy from John."
