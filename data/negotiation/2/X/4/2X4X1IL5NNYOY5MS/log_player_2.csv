"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $11,500. I think it's a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a decent deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm confident this product is worth more than that. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his ideal price point. He has 7 rounds remaining, so it's worth continuing to negotiate and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit above my budget at $11,000.  Let's try $10,750.  This feels like a fair compromise that's closer to both of our positions."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest, $10,750 is cutting it pretty close, and I might be better off exploring other options.  However, I value our conversation, so I'm willing to come down slightly to $10,900. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still within his budget at $10,900, but he has 5 rounds left and can potentially get a better deal. He's demonstrated his willingness to negotiate, and Alice has indicated she might be flexible. It's worth exploring if he can get a price closer to his target."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a price close to your value.  I'm still determined to get this product, and I believe $10,800 is a fair compromise. It's a good price for both of us, and hopefully, we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10800}
