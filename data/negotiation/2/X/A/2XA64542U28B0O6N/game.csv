"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us. I'm asking for $1,400,000. This price allows for a substantial profit for both of us. What do you say?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
