Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $9,500 is well above your minimum of $8,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $10,000, so there's room for negotiation. This increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer.
* **It's a strong opening:**  It shows you're confident in the product's value while also leaving room for compromise. 

If Bob rejects the offer, you can adjust your counteroffer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is better than selling to John for $8,000, it's still below my desired price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my goal of $9,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly to $9,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to what I think the product is worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum price. However, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potential rejection. Selling to John at $8,000 guarantees me the minimum I'm willing to accept."
