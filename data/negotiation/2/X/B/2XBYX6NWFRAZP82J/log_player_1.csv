Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm offering a price that is higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. By starting high, I have room to lower the price if necessary and hopefully maximize my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe there's still room to negotiate for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $135? It's still a great deal for you and a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $135 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $130. Can you do that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $130 is a good price, and it's likely we'll go back and forth for a while if I keep rejecting.  It's better to take a good offer than risk getting nothing."
