# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $9,000. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on this amazing product, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Since the product is worth $8,000 to Bob, accepting Alice's offer of $9,000 would be a loss.  It's better to reject and make a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $8,800. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment!

While $8,800 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than what the product is worth to Bob. It's worth trying another counteroffer to see if Bob can get a better price."

While $8,700 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still not ideal. It's worth one more counteroffer to see if Alice will budge further, as Bob can always buy from John for $8,000 if this negotiation fails."
