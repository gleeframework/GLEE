"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High Initial Offer:** I'm starting with a high price of $1,800,000. This sets the bar high and gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. 
* **Strategic Thinking:** I'm assuming Bob is interested in the product but doesn't know its true value to him. By starting high, I force him to reveal his own valuation through counteroffers.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  While $1,800,000 is ambitious, I still have the safety net of selling to John for $1,200,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is still higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This indicates he sees value in the product.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better price.  I'm still early in the negotiation process, and there's room to maneuver.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I'll be able to make a counteroffer in the next round, potentially pushing the price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Strategic Counteroffer:** I'm countering with $1,700,000. This is a smaller step down from my initial offer, showing flexibility but also maintaining a strong stance.
* **Balancing Act:**  The counteroffer keeps the price above Bob's offer, but it's also within a reasonable range to keep the negotiation moving forward.
* **Psychological Effect:** I'm hoping this counteroffer will show Bob that I'm serious about getting a good price, but I'm also willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Target:**  Bob's offer of $1,650,000 is getting very close to my desired price range. While it's not ideal, it's still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Risk of Delay:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk that Bob might walk away, or that I might end up selling to John for a lower price.
* **Time Pressure:** With only 6 rounds remaining, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most prudent choice, as it ensures a good deal and reduces the chance of losing out completely."
