Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $8,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $10,000 creates a win-win scenario:
    * Bob gets a $2,000 discount from his perceived value.
    * You make a $2,000 profit above your minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:** While you have John as a backup, getting a higher price from Bob is preferable.

By starting with a strong but fair offer, you increase the chances of Bob accepting and avoid leaving money on the table."
