"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $850000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a good price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further.  There's a potential for a better deal, and rejecting the offer allows for that negotiation to occur."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer! I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $850,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This price reflects my current needs and aligns with my maximum budget. I'm confident this is a fair offer for both of us."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $700000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $775000. This is a great compromise that still allows me to make a good profit while also being fair to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price.  $775,000 is a good compromise and still saves me a significant amount compared to buying from John.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of losing the deal altogether or Alice becoming unwilling to negotiate further.  Accepting this offer is the best choice in this situation."
