"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being flexible. I'm really interested in the product but $130 is a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $125?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concern, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price. How about we meet in the middle at $135? I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal.",135.0,Alice,3,
