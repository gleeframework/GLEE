"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. It's a significant discount from your initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $700,000 is significantly below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to secure a price closer to the product's worth."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $700,000 is simply too low. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This still gives you a significant discount and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $775,000. This is a fair price that I believe reflects the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $775,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I need to be closer to $800,000 to make this worthwhile."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I need to ensure a fair return on my product.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 meets my minimum requirement, and while I'd prefer to get more, it's in my best interest to secure the deal now. I risk losing the sale entirely if I keep negotiating."
