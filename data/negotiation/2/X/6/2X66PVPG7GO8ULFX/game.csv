"Alice, I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but $135 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $125. Let's see if we can make this work.",125.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you've made a final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $128. I'm willing to meet you at $129, but that's as low as I can go.",129.0,Alice,7,
