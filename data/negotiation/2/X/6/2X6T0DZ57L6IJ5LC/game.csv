"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price still allows you to make a profit and is a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $1,025,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
