"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase my product for $1,250,000. This is a great price considering the product's value to you, and it's well below what I could get from another buyer. Let me know your decision, and we can move forward from there. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is below her product's value to her, it's still more than what you're willing to pay and more importantly, more than what John offers. By rejecting this offer, you can proceed to buy from John at your desired price of $1,000,000."
