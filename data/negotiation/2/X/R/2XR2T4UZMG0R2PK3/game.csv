"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a compromise. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not quite there.  $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $900,000? It's a good price for you, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're still holding out for a higher price, but I'm not willing to go above $850,000. I'm willing to make a small concession and meet you at $875,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm still not quite there yet.  While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $875,000 is still a bit below my target.  Let's meet in the middle at $900,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product and our continued negotiations.",900000.0,Alice,5,
