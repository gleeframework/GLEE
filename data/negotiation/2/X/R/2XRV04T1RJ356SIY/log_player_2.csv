"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $180. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $150 to Alice, and she's offering it for $180, which is more than your maximum budget of $120.  You need to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $180 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $120 at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $165. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $165 is closer to your budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your maximum of $120. You should counteroffer again to try to get a price you're comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $165 is still a bit out of my range. I'm firm on my offer of $120. It's a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're firm on $120, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to go slightly lower than my previous offer, but I need to get at least $155. Can we meet at $155? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is still above your maximum budget of $120. You've already made two counteroffers, and it seems like she's not willing to go lower. At this point, it's better to take the guaranteed deal with John for $120 to ensure you get the product within your budget."
