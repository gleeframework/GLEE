"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $180 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $120 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $165. Is that something you'd be interested in?",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $165 is still a bit out of my range. I'm firm on my offer of $120. It's a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",120.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're firm on $120, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to go slightly lower than my previous offer, but I need to get at least $155. Can we meet at $155?",155.0,Alice,5,
