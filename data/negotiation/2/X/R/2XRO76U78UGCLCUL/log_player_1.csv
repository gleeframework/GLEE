{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $130 is higher than your minimum of $100, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $130 is lower than Bob's value of $150, giving him an incentive to buy.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can still adjust the price if Bob makes a counteroffer. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending under $120. Would you be willing to lower the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is a decent offer, I believe I can get a higher price. I'll reject Bob's counteroffer and try to push him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $125? This price still gives you a great value and allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 125}
