"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that being said, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, which is a significant investment for me and a fair price considering the value to you. Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a significant investment for you, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value the product holds for you and the price I'm willing to accept.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000 for the product. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value the product holds for you and the price I'm willing to accept.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me. While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm still unable to go that high. I'm prepared to pay $975,000, which is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's fair considering the value you place on the product.  This is my final offer, I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm flattered that you're willing to invest so heavily in this product. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $975,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
