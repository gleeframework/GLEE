"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product's potential, $22,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is still a fair price considering my budget.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks again for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $12,000.  It's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal at that point.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,4,
