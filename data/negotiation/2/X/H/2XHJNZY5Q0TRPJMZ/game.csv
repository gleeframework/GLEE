,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $120 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $140? It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $140 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $130, but that's the highest I can go. Can you consider that?",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're sticking to your budget.  I'm willing to come down a little more to $135. This is a good compromise for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, but I still need to save a bit more. Can you consider $128? That's the lowest I can go, but I really want this product.",128.0,Bob,6,
