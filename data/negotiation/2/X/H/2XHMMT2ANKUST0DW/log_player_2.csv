Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a very aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a 50% discount from Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal and it leaves room for negotiation.  It's likely Alice will reject this, but it sets the stage for further bargaining."
