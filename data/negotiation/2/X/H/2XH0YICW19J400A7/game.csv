"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $1,600,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $1,400,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1,200,000. I'm confident this product offers tremendous value.  How about we meet at $1,450,000?  This reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,450,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
