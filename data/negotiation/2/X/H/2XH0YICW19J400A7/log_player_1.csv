"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Gauge Interest:**  The message is designed to be open-ended, encouraging Bob to respond and reveal his initial thoughts on the price.
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for my minimum acceptable price, giving me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $1,600,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $1,400,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. He increased his offer significantly from his initial perceived value, suggesting he might be willing to go higher. I'll counter with a price closer to my starting point to test the waters."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1,200,000. I'm confident this product offers tremendous value.  How about we meet at $1,450,000?  This reflects the true worth of what I'm offering."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a significant concession from my initial offer but remained above Bob's offer and my minimum. This shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price point and potentially sway Bob's perception. 
* **Seeking Middle Ground:**  The $1,450,000 offer is a strong signal that I'm seeking a mutually beneficial deal but not willing to settle for the absolute minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,450,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is a significant increase from his previous offer and a reasonable compromise. 
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** While he claims it's his final offer, there's no guarantee he won't negotiate further. However, it signals strong interest and suggests he's nearing his limit.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of losing Bob as a buyer. Accepting this offer secures a substantial profit above my minimum ($1,200,000) and avoids potentially lengthy negotiations."
