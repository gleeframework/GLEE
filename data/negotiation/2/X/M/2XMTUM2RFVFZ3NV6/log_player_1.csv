{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, but I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'd be willing to make a deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to settle for a price that's too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and it's a price I'm confident we can both live with."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still not enough.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  I'd rather have a sure sale than risk negotiating further and potentially ending up with less."
