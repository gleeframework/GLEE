"I'm really interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'd be willing to make a deal at that price.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and it's a price I'm confident we can both live with.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
