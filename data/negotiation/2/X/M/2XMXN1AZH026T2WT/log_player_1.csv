Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd make:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your backup offer from John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,500,000 
* **Potential Profit:** $500,000 (the difference between Bob's value and your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob finds the deal acceptable. Offering a price slightly below his maximum value makes it a good deal for him while still netting you a significant gain.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Why This Offer Makes Sense**

* **Profitable:** You secure a $400,000 profit, significantly more than John's offer.
* **Attractive to Bob:** He saves $100,000 compared to his perceived value.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong starting point, there's a slight buffer for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
