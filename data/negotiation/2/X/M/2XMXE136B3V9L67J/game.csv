"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  It's worth significantly more than that, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $1,350,000?  This would still leave you with a good profit margin and allow me to reach a reasonable price.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
