Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  It's a unique opportunity with a lot of potential.  My price is $1,400,000.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still below my absolute minimum ($1,500,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm hinting at the product's value, hoping to make Bob more receptive to a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** Great! I've achieved a good price.
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll carefully consider Bob's counteroffer, keeping in mind my absolute minimum and John's offer of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** While Bob is showing interest, I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a more favorable price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range. I'll consider John's offer of $1,500,000 as a benchmark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I value your interest, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Sort of):** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($1,400,000) and Bob's offer ($900,000).  This demonstrates flexibility while still staying within my desired range.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Win-Win Frame:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation where both parties get something they want.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** I've secured a good price. 
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll carefully consider his next counteroffer, keeping John's offer in mind. I'll need to decide if I'm willing to keep negotiating or if I'm better off taking John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1150000 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. Can we meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:**  $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, and significantly less than my desired range. 
* **John's Offer is Attractive:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $1,500,000, making the risk of further negotiation with Bob unnecessary. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter Offer (Potentially):**  While I'm not obligated to, I could consider making a counteroffer to Bob to see if he's willing to budge, but I will likely keep my counteroffer close to $1,150,000. 
* **Sell to John:**  I'm leaning towards selling to John, as it guarantees me my minimum desired price and removes the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not able to come down to $950,000.  To make this work, I'm willing to go as low as $1,050,000.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This offer is my final attempt to secure a deal with Bob,  while still staying above my absolute minimum price. 
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** I'm framing my offer as a significant concession to emphasize my willingness to meet halfway.
* **Hopeful Tone:** Maintaining a hopeful tone encourages Bob to consider accepting the offer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1050000 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $975000. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:**  While Bob is demonstrating persistence, $975,000 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **John's Offer is Guaranteed:**  I have a sure thing with John's offer of $1,500,000, and I've already made significant concessions with Bob. Continuing to negotiate with him would be risky and time-consuming.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept John's Offer:** I'll finalize the sale with John, as it guarantees me the best possible price and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
