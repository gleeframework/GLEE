Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** This leaves room for potential counteroffers and allows you to potentially earn more.
* **It's a fair starting point:** This creates a basis for a potential mutually beneficial agreement.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes that Bob is motivated to buy the product. If he's not, it might be better to go with John's offer right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $9,000 is significantly less than my minimum of $15,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation:** I can likely get a higher price by making a counteroffer.
* **John's offer is a backup:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for $15,000, ensuring I get my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $9,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this work.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to move forward with the sale. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This shows willingness to negotiate and encourages him to reciprocate.
* **Still above my minimum:**  This offer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Justification:** I provide a reason for the counteroffer, emphasizing the value Bob will get at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $9,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $9,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum of $15,000.
* **Further negotiation might be time-consuming:**  There's a chance that Bob won't budge further, and further negotiation might just waste time.
* **John's offer is secure:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $15,000, which ensures I get my desired profit. 

It's better to take the guaranteed deal with John than to risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially end up with a lower price."
