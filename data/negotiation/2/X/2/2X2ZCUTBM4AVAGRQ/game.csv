"Alice,  $13,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product.  This is my best offer, but I'm open to discussing it further. ",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $12,500?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my target price.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get closer to your target price, but $12,500 is still a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  Let's meet in the middle. I'll offer you $12,000.  This is my final offer, and it's the most I can afford. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to move on to another seller.",12000.0,Bob,4,
