Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $130.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a decent price, it's still above my maximum budget of $150. I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $110 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate you're interested.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $110 is still a little low for me.  How about $120?  I think that's fair considering the value this product brings. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $120 is still within my budget of $150, and it's a good deal for me compared to buying from John for $150. I'm willing to accept this offer."
