"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and yield a significant return on your investment."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):** By starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value and even my own minimum, I aim to set a high anchor. This might make subsequent offers seem more reasonable in comparison.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The high initial price leaves ample room for negotiation and potential counteroffers. 
* **Confidence and Value Emphasis:** The message emphasizes the product's value and potential, aiming to justify the high initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is above his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate, but I believe there's room to reach a better outcome. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed option, but I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with a few more rounds of negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the value. However, the price you proposed doesn't reflect the true potential and worth of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we consider $1,100,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility, but Hold Ground:** By coming down to $1,100,000, I demonstrate willingness to negotiate but remain firm above my $1,000,000 minimum.  
* **Meeting Halfway (Concession):** Suggesting to ""meet halfway"" frames the counteroffer as a fair compromise, even though it's closer to my initial price than Bob's. 
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's untapped potential, subtly pushing back against his lower valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value to me and is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is increasing slowly, and he seems anchored to a price point significantly below my minimum. It's unlikely I can bridge the gap between his valuation and mine in the remaining rounds. Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees I meet my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of further drawn-out negotiations with an uncertain outcome."
