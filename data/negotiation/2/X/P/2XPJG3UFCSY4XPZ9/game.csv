"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I'm glad you like it. However, I'm afraid I won't be able to meet you at $1050000. I'm willing to consider a price of $1150000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $1075000, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my original offer. How about $1080000? This is my final concession, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",1080000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to feel like we're stuck in a loop, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm going to make one final offer. How about we meet right in the middle at $1075000? If you're still not willing to meet me there, I'm going to have to consider other options.",1075000.0,Alice,9,
