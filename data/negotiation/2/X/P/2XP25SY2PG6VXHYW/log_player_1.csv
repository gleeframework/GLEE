"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 
 
This offer is a starting point. It's lower than my minimum acceptable price, but it gives Bob a good reason to negotiate. I believe it's a fair price, given that the product is worth $800,000 to him. 

I'll be ready to counteroffer if he rejects it, but I'm also keeping John in mind as a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but it's still below my desired price.  I want to see if I can push him a little further. I'll reject his offer and counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price is still a great value for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price than $920,000. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer!  I'm willing to drop my price to $940,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 940000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $940,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $910,000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but not quite there. I'm also getting closer to the end of the negotiation rounds. To secure a sale and avoid the risk of Bob continuing to offer lower prices, I'm choosing to sell to John. He offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than what I'm currently getting from Bob."
