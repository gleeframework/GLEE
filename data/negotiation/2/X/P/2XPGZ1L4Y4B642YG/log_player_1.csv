Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe will greatly benefit your needs.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the introductory discount, $200 is outside my budget. Given my maximum value for this product is $100, I'm willing to offer you $80 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
