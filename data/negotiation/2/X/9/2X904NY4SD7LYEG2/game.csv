"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $18000 is a bit steep for me.  Considering my budget, I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $14000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14000 is still a bit out of my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12000? This feels like a fair price considering the back-and-forth we've had.",12000.0,Bob,4,
