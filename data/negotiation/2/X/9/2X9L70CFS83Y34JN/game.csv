"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is too steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a bit of a budget. How about $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $90? It's still a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with $75. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $85? It's getting close to the value I have in mind, and I think it's a fair compromise.",85.0,Alice,5,
