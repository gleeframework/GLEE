"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget and it seems like she's not willing to go lower than $11,250.  It's better to secure the product for $10,000 from John than to risk further negotiation with Alice."
