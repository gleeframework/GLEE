,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the value the product brings and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome.  Let's close this deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $900,000 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $875,000.  Let's find a middle ground and finalize this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $875,000 just doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $887,500. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's seal the deal.",887500.0,Alice,5,
