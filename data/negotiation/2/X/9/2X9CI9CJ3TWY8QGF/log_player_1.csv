{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) but still lower than Bob's estimated value ($1,000,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This allows for room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, and increases the chances of reaching a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Framing It Positively:**  I'm framing the offer as ""fair"" and emphasizing the value to Bob's business to encourage him to consider it. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm clearly indicating my willingness to negotiate, which is essential for a successful outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:** While it's a significant improvement from his previous rejection, $850,000 is still below my minimum of $800,000. 
* **I have leverage:** I can counteroffer and potentially get closer to my target price. 
* **John's offer is a backup:** If the negotiations with Bob don't lead to a better outcome, I can always sell to John. 

**Next Steps:**  I will counteroffer Bob with a price that is closer to my target of $950,000."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the value the product brings and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm starting with a counteroffer that is halfway between my previous offer of $950,000 and Bob's offer of $850,000. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value the product brings to his business to emphasize that a slightly higher price is justified.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and assertive tone to express my confidence in the value of the product and my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Show Flexibility:**  While I'm not accepting Bob's offer, I'm demonstrating my willingness to compromise, which can help to keep the negotiations moving forward."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $900,000 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $875,000.  Let's find a middle ground and finalize this deal.
