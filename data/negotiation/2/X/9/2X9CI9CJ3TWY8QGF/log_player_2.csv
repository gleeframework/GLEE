"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is better than $1,000,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the value the product brings and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible. While $900,000 is closer to his desired price, there's still a gap.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to potentially secure a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $875,000 just doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $887,500. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's seal the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Saving Money:** Accepting the offer at $887,500 saves Bob $112,500 compared to buying from John.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to further counteroffers and potentially more time spent. At this point, the potential savings are minimal.
* **Reasonable Compromise:**  Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and $887,500 represents a reasonable compromise.

While Bob might be able to squeeze out a bit more, the risk of losing the deal altogether by continuing to negotiate outweighs the potential benefit."
