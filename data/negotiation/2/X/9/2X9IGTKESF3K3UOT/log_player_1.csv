Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $200. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and enthusiastic tone to create a good impression.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm hinting at the product's value without revealing too much.

This strategy aims to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get him to counteroffer, allowing me to adjust my price if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  While Bob is interested, I believe there's room for negotiation. 
* **John as a safety net:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me the flexibility to hold out for a better price from Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $175.  This still allows me to make a fair profit, and I believe it's a competitive price for the value you'll get."", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $200, but not by much.
* **Value Emphasis:** I reiterate the product's value and emphasize the ""fair profit"" I'd still receive. 
* **Clear Price:** I've given a specific price point to make it easy for Bob to respond.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground that is both fair to me and potentially appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to pay $150, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum:** Bob's offer of $150 meets my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No Further Gain:**  I'm unlikely to get a better price from Bob, as he's already stated his maximum.
* **Equal Value:**  Selling to John would give me the same price.

Since I'm not guaranteed to get a higher offer from Bob, and John offers the same price, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice. It guarantees the sale and avoids further negotiation."
