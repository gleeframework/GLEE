Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This offer stands for 24 hours."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and a potentially quicker sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offered price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still represents a substantial discount from John's offer.
* **Time Pressure:** The 24-hour limit creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision.

This approach balances your desire for maximum profit with the understanding that a slightly lower price to Bob might be more appealing if it means a faster and less complicated sale."
