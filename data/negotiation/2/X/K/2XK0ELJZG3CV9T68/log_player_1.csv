{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  $100 is more than $80, so Bob has incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $100 is less than your minimum of $120, so you still have room to negotiate. 
* **It's a fair starting point:** It's a reasonable price that allows for a back-and-forth negotiation. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $85 is closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to accept just yet.  Here's why:

* **Room for negotiation:** I can still potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer:**  I have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John, so I'm not in a rush to settle for less.
* **Testing the waters:** Rejecting this offer lets Bob know I'm serious about a higher price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can gauge his interest and potentially push him a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $85 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $95? That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not willing to settle for too low of a price.
* **Fairness:**  $95 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's lower than his initial valuation of $80. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By refusing to drop below my minimum price, I'm showing Bob that I'm not desperate to sell and I have other options.

Let's see if this counteroffer convinces Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to pay $80, but that's the maximum I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying it from John for $80 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, selling to John for $120 is the best option at this point. Here's why:

* **Minimum met:**  John's offer guarantees me my minimum price, which is crucial.
* **Negotiation stalled:** Bob is unwilling to budge from $80, and further negotiation might lead to a stalemate.
* **Time is money:**  I don't want to risk wasting more time with Bob only to potentially end up with a lower price than John's offer. 

By selling to John, I secure a good deal and avoid any further negotiation hassles."
