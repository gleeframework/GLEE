"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be of significant value to your business. I understand its worth to you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My asking price is $1,400,000. This allows for a healthy profit for you while ensuring I get a fair return on my investment. Let's discuss this further and see if we can come to terms. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $1,400,000, while John wants $1,500,000.
* **The offer is within your budget:**  The product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, and she's asking $1,400,000. This is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best course of action, as it saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John."
