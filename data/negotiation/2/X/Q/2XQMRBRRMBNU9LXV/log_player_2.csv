"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects the significant return on investment you'll see. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is far above your maximum budget of $800,000. It's not even worth considering accepting.  You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer of $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can't justify that price.  I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $2,000,000 represents the high end of the product's value, I understand your position. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,600,000. I believe this price point reflects the true worth of the product and offers you a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,600,000 is still significantly higher than your budget of $800,000. While it's a slight improvement from her initial offer, it's still not within your range. You should reject her offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,600,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to pay $900,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my financial constraints. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about acquiring this product, and I respect your budget limitations. Let's meet in the middle. I propose a final offer of $1,250,000. This represents a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to see this deal through.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $1,250,000 is still too high for Bob.  While it's a substantial decrease, it's still more than Bob's budget. At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $800,000.  This ensures he gets the product while staying within his financial limits."
