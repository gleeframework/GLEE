"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it's worth a great deal to you, considering its potential. How about we start at $14,000?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good price, it's still higher than Alice's value of $8,000. There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the potential you see in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is taking a more aggressive approach, trying to get a lower price quickly. He offers $11,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation. This counteroffer aims to demonstrate Bob's willingness to negotiate but also his desire for a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we settle at $12,500? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's desired price. Bob is trying to get the best possible deal, and he should continue negotiating to see if he can get a price closer to his target. Rejecting Alice's offer allows him to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit outside my budget. Let's aim for a more agreeable price point. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This would be a win-win situation for both of us, as it's a fair price that allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is demonstrating his commitment to a fair deal by increasing his offer. He's strategically chosen a price that's halfway between his previous offer and Alice's current offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still negotiating for a better price. This counteroffer aims to encourage Alice to accept while leaving a small margin for further negotiation if needed."
