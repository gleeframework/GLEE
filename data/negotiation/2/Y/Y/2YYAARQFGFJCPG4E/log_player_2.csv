Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $1,000,000? That's still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's find a middle ground.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $700,000 simply won't work for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $850,000?  This gives you a great price for the product while still allowing me to make a decent profit.  Let's finalize this deal.
