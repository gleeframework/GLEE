"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $20,000 is far above his budget, and he can get the product for $8,000 from John.  He should counteroffer Alice and see if he can get a better price before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go above $8,000.  That's my absolute maximum. "", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $14,000 is closer to his budget, it's still too high. He can get the product for significantly less from John. He should counteroffer again to see if he can get Alice closer to his price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant discount. How about we settle at $12,000? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. While Alice has come down in price, she's still above Bob's budget.  John is offering the product at his maximum price, and it's time to stop negotiating with Alice and finalize the deal with John."
