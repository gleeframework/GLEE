"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go above $8,000.  That's my absolute maximum. ",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant discount. How about we settle at $12,000? That's my final offer.",12000.0,Alice,5,
