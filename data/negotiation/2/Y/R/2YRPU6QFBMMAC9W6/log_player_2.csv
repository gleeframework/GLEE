"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob can save $3,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and attempting to negotiate a lower price.  While buying from John is always an option, it's more advantageous to try and get a better deal from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering a price of $7,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $9,000, but still higher than Alice's minimum of $8,000. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still being a good deal for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is higher than her original offer. This means she's willing to negotiate but may be holding firm to a higher price point. While buying from John for $12,000 is still an option, it's worth exploring further negotiation with Alice, as there's a potential for a better price.  Rejecting this offer and sending another counteroffer allows Bob to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $8,500. This is a compromise between his previous offer of $7,000 and Alice's latest offer of $9,500.  It's still a decent price for Bob, while being closer to Alice's minimum acceptable price. This increases the likelihood of Alice accepting the offer and closing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's latest counteroffer of $9,750 is very close to her initial offer of $9,000. It seems like she's not budging much. At this point, Bob is running the risk of going back and forth for a long time with no guarantee of a lower price. Buying from John for $12,000 is now the more sensible option. Although it's not the best deal, it guarantees a purchase at a known price and avoids further negotiation that might not lead to a better outcome."
