"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a little high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $800,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1,000,000. This is my best and final offer for now.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $900,000? This seems like a fair compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm trying to get a fair deal.  $950,000 is my final offer. I think this is a reasonable compromise.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,100,000, which is $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
