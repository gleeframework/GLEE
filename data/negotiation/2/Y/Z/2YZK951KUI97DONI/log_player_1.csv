"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This sets a strong initial baseline and allows room for negotiation.  I want to see how Bob reacts to this initial offer and gauge his potential interest.  I'm also aware that I can always walk away and sell to John for $800,000 if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but also demonstrates that I still value the product at a higher price. Hopefully, this will lead to a quicker resolution in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, $920,000 is a good compromise. We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely. This is a good outcome, especially considering my minimum desired price was $800,000."
