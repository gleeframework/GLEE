"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, considering its worth to me is significantly higher. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. I would like to counteroffer at $10,500.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I've considered your latest offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I would like to propose a price of $10,800. This seems to be a fair compromise given the value you place on the product.",10800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,800 is still a bit too far below what I need to make this deal work. How about $11,200?  This is a fair compromise, as it's closer to your last offer, and it allows me to recover a good portion of the product's value to me. ",11200.0,Alice,5,
