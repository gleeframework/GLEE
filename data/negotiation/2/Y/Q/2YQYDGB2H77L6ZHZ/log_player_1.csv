Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Bob the product for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. 

Here's the logic behind this offer:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** By asking for more, I increase the potential profit I could earn.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,200,000 gives me a baseline. If Bob rejects my offer, I'm still guaranteed a decent sale.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Bob may be willing to pay a price closer to my asking price, especially if he values the product highly. 

This strategy balances the risk of losing the sale to Bob with the possibility of getting a higher price."
