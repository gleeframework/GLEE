"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. My initial offer is $1000000.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of this product, $1000000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product while remaining within my financial constraints. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet closer to my initial price. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to come down to $950000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's worth while still being a good deal for you.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950000 is closer to what I can afford, I'm still hoping to land a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $900000, which is a fair compromise and a significant step towards finalizing this sale.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, which is $925000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",925000.0,Alice,5,
