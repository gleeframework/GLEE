"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your desired price point of $8,000.  There's room for negotiation, and you should aim for a lower price.  You can use the fact that you have a fallback option (buying from John) to your advantage."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to my minimum value of $15,000. How about we meet in the middle at $11,750? This would still be a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and it would be a fair compromise for me. What do you think?

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,750 is still above my desired price point of $8,000.  While it's a compromise, I can still try to negotiate a lower price.  I have the option of buying from John for $8,000, so I'm not pressured to accept Alice's offer.  I'll make another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my budget."

# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle again. However, I'm still not comfortable with $10,625. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum value. How about we meet at $12,000? This would still be a good deal for you, and it would be a fair compromise for me.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still too high for me. While she has made concessions, we seem to be at an impasse.  I'm not willing to go any higher than $8,000.  It's better to buy from John, who is offering a guaranteed price that fits my budget."
