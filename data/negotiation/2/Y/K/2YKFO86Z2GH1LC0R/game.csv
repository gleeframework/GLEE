"Thank you for your response, Bob. After careful consideration, I must respectfully decline your offer. My current proposal stands at $14000 for the product, reflecting its value to you and the market conditions. I understand your perspective, but I hope you'll see that my offer remains fair and reasonable. If you're still interested, I'd be glad to continue our discussion.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to sell the product for $14000, Alice. However, I'm still looking to save some money. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $12500 for the product. This is a compromise between our previous discussions, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. What are your thoughts?",12500.0,Bob,4,
