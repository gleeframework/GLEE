"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $600,000 undervalues the product's potential. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet in the middle from there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we have a guaranteed offer from John for $800,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob has a risk of ending up with a lower final price, especially since he's explicitly stated his budget limit. It's better to take the sure thing with John at this point."
