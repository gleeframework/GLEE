"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $600,000 undervalues the product's potential. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet in the middle from there?",750000.0,Bob,4,
