"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its value to you, I propose an initial price of $12,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a better price than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get an even better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value to me and your asking price."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. In light of this, I am willing to consider your offer. However, I must respectfully decline it. My final offer for the product is $10,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $10,500 is less than Bob's maximum price of $15,000.
* **It's a good deal compared to John:**  $10,500 is significantly lower than buying from John.
* **Further negotiation is risky:**  There's no guarantee that Alice will accept a lower counteroffer, and time spent negotiating could be wasted.

By accepting Alice's offer, Bob secures the product for a good price within his budget and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
