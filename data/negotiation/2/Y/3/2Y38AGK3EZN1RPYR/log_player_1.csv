**Reasoning:**

While we're still above our minimum, Bob is steadily increasing his offer, and we're getting into diminishing returns territory. Accepting $1,750,000 ensures a significant profit without risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with John's offer or a worse offer from Bob."
