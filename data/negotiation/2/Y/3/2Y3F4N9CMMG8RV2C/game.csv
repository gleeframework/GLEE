"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  This product would be very valuable to me at a lower price point. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $16,000. It's a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  To be honest, $16,000 is still a stretch for me.  How about we try $13,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $13,000 is still a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise further. I'll offer it to you for $14,500. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to compromise. While $14,500 is closer, it's still a tough pill for me to swallow.  Would you consider $13,750?  I'm trying to meet you in the middle.",13750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $14,000. I've already compromised a lot, and this is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at $14,000, I'll consider it. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",14000.0,Alice,7,
