"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $12,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I would like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $8,000 to her, so I'm sure she's willing to sell it for less than that. I'd like to try to negotiate a lower price. I'll reject her offer and see if I can find a better deal.
