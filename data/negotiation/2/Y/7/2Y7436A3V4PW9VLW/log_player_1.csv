Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I open it up to other buyers. I believe its value far exceeds your initial assessment, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John offers the safety net of $1,200,000, aiming higher with Bob could yield a better return.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offered price of $1,100,000 is:
    * Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), giving room for negotiation.
    *  Lower than John's offer, making it potentially attractive to Bob.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The ""limited-time offer"" and mention of ""other buyers"" are designed to encourage Bob to act quickly."
