"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  It's valued at $1,200,000 to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in this product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This would be a great deal for both of us, and I think it's a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal!",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I think we can get even closer to a deal. How about $920,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer.",920000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $920,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $935,000.  That's a fair compromise that takes into account both of our needs. It's closer to your offer, but still allows me to get a decent return.  Let's get this deal done.",935000.0,Alice,5,
