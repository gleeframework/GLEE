{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000.  I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by leaving some room for potential compromise while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price.  It also sets a positive tone by suggesting a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $17,000 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $14,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below your minimum price of $15,000.  While you want to sell the product, you don't want to lose money on it.  It's best to counter his offer and try to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is below my minimum price.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,500?  This would still be a good value for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15,000. This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $15,000 meets your minimum price requirement.  It's a fair price for both of you, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation and the potential of selling to John for the same price."
