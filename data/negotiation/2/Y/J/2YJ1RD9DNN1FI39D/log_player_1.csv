"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it has great potential for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm opening with a high price to leave room for negotiation and potentially maximize my profit. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm framing the offer as an ""incredible opportunity"" and highlighting the potential benefits for Bob.
* **Openness:** I'm inviting Bob to share his thoughts, encouraging a dialogue. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy is designed to gauge Bob's interest and understand his potential valuation of the product. By starting high, I can potentially secure a better price, even if we need to negotiate down. However, I'm also prepared to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low, as I have a guaranteed backup buyer in John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price, but I believe there's a possibility he might be willing to pay more, especially as he expressed initial interest.
* **Maintaining Negotiation Power:**  By rejecting his offer, I maintain leverage and signal that I'm not desperate for a sale. This could encourage Bob to increase his offer.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 10 rounds, it's important to try and maximize my potential earnings.

**Next Step:**

I'll counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer. This will test his seriousness and see if he's willing to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. While I'm open to negotiation, $800,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me at this time. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, considering your interest and the product's potential value to you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer is a smaller step down from my initial offer, testing Bob's willingness to compromise without giving away too much.
* **Framing the Compromise:** I'm emphasizing ""finding a middle ground"" to make the counteroffer feel more collaborative and less like a hard stance.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** While I'm showing flexibility, I'm still above Bob's offer, reminding him that I have options.

**Strategy:**

This approach aims to gauge Bob's commitment and explore whether there's a price point where we can both agree. If he's willing to go slightly higher, I've gained some ground. If he rejects again, I'll have to evaluate if his counteroffer is worth accepting or if it's time to move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $900000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  Bob's offer is now closer to my ideal price point, but I still believe there's room for negotiation. 
* **Leverage Remaining:**  I'm not yet desperate to close the deal, and rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open. 
* **Limited Rounds:** While we're approaching the middle rounds, I still have enough time to continue negotiating with Bob.

**Next Step:**

I'll counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, aiming to find a compromise that benefits both of us. This will test Bob's seriousness and see if he's willing to budge further. I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $850,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I still need to be a bit higher.  How about $875,000? That's a fair compromise that allows us both to make a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:** I'm increasing the offer by a smaller amount this time ($25,000) to show I'm willing to be flexible but still maintain a price that's beneficial to me. 
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  I'm framing this as a ""fair compromise"" to encourage Bob to see the offer as mutually advantageous.
* **Testing Commitment:**  This counteroffer will reveal if Bob is truly committed to acquiring the product or if he's simply trying to get a better deal.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to create a sense of urgency and potentially encourage Bob to make a final offer. If he rejects this offer, I'll need to assess if his next counteroffer is acceptable or if it's time to move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but $875000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $850001, but no more. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,001
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  Bob's offer is only $1 more than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Limited Rounds:**  We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. There's a risk of further negotiation pushing us to the final round with no guarantee of a better offer.
* **Minimizing Loss:**  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting this offer ensures I won't be left with John's $800,000 offer, which is my absolute floor.

**Strategy:**

This decision balances the desire for a higher price with the reality of a dwindling number of negotiation rounds. While it's not ideal to accept a price this close to my minimum, it's a pragmatic choice to secure a deal and avoid a potential loss."
