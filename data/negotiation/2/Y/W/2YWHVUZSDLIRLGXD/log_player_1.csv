Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm asking for $14,000."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a strong opening offer significantly above both your minimum price and Bob's perceived value sets a good starting point for negotiation. This leaves room for you to potentially negotiate down while still securing a price significantly higher than your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good profit, there's still room for negotiation. Bob's counteroffer suggests he's willing to pay above his perceived value of $10,000. By rejecting his offer and proposing a slightly lower price, we can potentially meet in the middle and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $13,000?"",
""product_price"": 13000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate and moves closer to Bob's price, aiming for a compromise. 
* **Maintaining a strong position:** By decreasing the price by a smaller increment ($1,000 instead of $2,000), we signal that we're confident in the product's value. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** There's still a $1,000 difference between our offer and Bob's last counteroffer, leaving space for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $11,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is the maximum I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's latest offer of $11,500 is a solid profit, exceeding our minimum price by $1,500.  While we could potentially push for a bit more, his message suggests he's reaching his upper limit. Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids the risk of him walking away, potentially leaving us with John's offer of $10,000."
