"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product, valued at over a million dollars to me, for $1200000. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still above your maximum budget. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $200,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying but also sets a strong negotiation point. It's possible she might reject it, but it's a good starting point to see how flexible she is."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1000000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $1100000 to make this deal work. It's still a great value considering the product's true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but it's still too high for my budget. I want to see if I can get her closer to my initial counteroffer.  I'll make another counteroffer and see how she responds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  This is my final offer, let me know if you're willing to accept it."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but it's still below Alice's latest price.  I'm trying to find a middle ground while also indicating that I'm getting closer to my limit. I've also added a statement that this is my final offer to put a bit of pressure on Alice to make a decision."
