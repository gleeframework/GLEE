Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really like. I'm asking $90 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $90, which is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum price of $80 but also gives Bob some room to negotiate.  I'm also making the offer friendly and inviting to encourage Bob to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think $90 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is close to my minimum price of $80, and I don't want to risk losing the sale and having to sell to John for a lower price.  I'm happy to accept Bob's offer."
