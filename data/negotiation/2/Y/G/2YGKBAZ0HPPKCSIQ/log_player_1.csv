{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product.  While I value it at over $1,200,000, I'm offering it to you for a limited time at $1,150,000. I believe in win-win scenarios, and this price allows me to recoup a fair value while offering you a significant discount compared to what I would receive elsewhere."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit, but Stay Realistic:**  Offering the product just above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) is unlikely to work. Aiming for the highest possible price while still giving Bob a reason to buy is key.
* **Highlight Value:**  Emphasize the product's worth to both you (over $1,200,000) and Bob.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** The phrase ""limited time"" subtly implies that Bob might miss out if he hesitates, making John's guaranteed purchase a powerful motivator.
* **""Win-Win"" Framing:** By presenting the offer as beneficial to both parties, you increase the likelihood of Bob accepting. 

**Why this price?**

* $1,150,000 is closer to your walk-away price ($1,200,000 from John).
* It still offers Bob a $50,000 ""discount"" compared to your stated value. 

**Important Note:**  This assumes you have no way of knowing Bob's absolute maximum willingness to pay. In a real negotiation, gathering more information about Bob's needs and budget would be crucial."
