"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special introductory price of $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $12,000 is still too high for Bob, as he's willing to pay up to $15,000.  There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the special price, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down a bit?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to pay closer to $10,000, Bob, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's target of $10,000. There's room to negotiate further, and Bob is willing to risk losing the deal to John rather than settle for a price that's not ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm closer to your offer now, I'm still looking for a price closer to $11,000.  If we can find a compromise at that level, I'm ready to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to meeting your target, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make at least $12,000 to justify the sale. I'm counteroffering at $11,500 is too low, so I'm going to try to meet you in the middle again. I'm offering the product to you for $11,250. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can seal the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Alice's offer of $11,250 is still above Bob's target of $10,000, but it's getting closer.
* **Risk:**  Bob has already rejected a few offers, and he has limited rounds left. If he rejects this offer, there's a risk that Alice might become less flexible, or Bob might need to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Potential for More Negotiation:**  While Bob is willing to accept the offer, it doesn't mean he's completely satisfied.  He might still try to negotiate a lower price in the future rounds, if possible.

Therefore, accepting the offer seems like the most logical choice at this point, considering the balance between value and risk."
