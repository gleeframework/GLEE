"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below 130. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down from her original price of $120 to $130. This is still a good deal for you, as you can get the product for less than your maximum budget of $150 and still save some money. It's likely that further negotiation won't get you a significantly lower price, so accepting Alice's offer is the best choice in this situation."
