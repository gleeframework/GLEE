Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than my minimum price of $1,200,000.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1250000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but it's getting closer.  I'm willing to take the $1,250,000, as it's a significant profit and avoids further negotiation."
