"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!",17000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your time, but $17000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle at $14500?",14500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $14500 is simply too low for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $16000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you say?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $14250. Can we meet in the middle?",14250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, but $14250 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15500, which is a fair compromise.  This is a great deal for both of us. Let's reach an agreement and close this deal.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $15500 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $14750 for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",14750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $14750 just isn't enough for me. I'm going to have to stick to my previous offer of $15500. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this round.",15500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're sticking to your price, but I'm still not comfortable with $15500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $14875. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",14875.0,Bob,8,
