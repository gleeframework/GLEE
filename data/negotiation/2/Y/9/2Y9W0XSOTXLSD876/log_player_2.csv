"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you based on its value of $15,000 to you. I am offering this exceptional item at a special introductory price of $12,000. This is an opportunity to acquire a high-quality product at a significant discount compared to its true worth. Please let me know if you are interested in discussing further details or proceeding with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice is clearly inflating the value of the product. While $12,000 is less than your $15,000 maximum, you can likely get a better deal. By rejecting her offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice or resort to buying from John at your maximum budget."
