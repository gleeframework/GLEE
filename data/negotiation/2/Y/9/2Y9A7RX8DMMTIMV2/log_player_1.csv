Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, Bob's offers are still below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not confident I can get him to budge enough in the remaining time. It's becoming increasingly likely that I won't be able to close a deal with Bob at a satisfactory price.  Therefore, I'll take the guaranteed offer from John to ensure I don't lose out on a substantial amount of money."
