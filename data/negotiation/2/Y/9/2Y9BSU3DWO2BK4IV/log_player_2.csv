"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price. To start, I propose a price of $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You can save money by negotiating further.  It's also worth noting that you can buy the product from John for $1,200,000, so you have a safety net. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to get a better price."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? I believe that's a fair reflection of the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than you'd like to pay.  You can likely still negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to get closer to your target price.  Remember, you have the option to buy from John for $1,200,000 if you can't reach a deal with Alice."
