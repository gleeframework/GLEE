"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for $2,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering the value it brings. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Starting at $2,000,000 sets a strong initial expectation and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Focus on value:**  Highlighting the value to Bob reinforces the potential benefit of the deal. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message leaves the door open for discussion and allows Bob to counteroffer. 
* **Protecting my interests:**  This price is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, ensuring I don't settle for less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2,000,000 is way above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $850,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and even below the value Bob himself places on the product ($800,000). 
* **Room for negotiation:** I have 9 rounds remaining, and there's potential to get a better deal. 
* **Avoiding a bad deal:** Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss for me.

I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $850,000 is far too low for this product. It's worth significantly more, and I'm confident it will bring you great value. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to lower my price to $1,600,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable offer:** This counteroffer is significantly higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Focus on value:** I reiterate the product's value to Bob, reminding him of its potential benefits. 
* **Compromise language:**  Using phrases like ""meet in the middle"" and ""fair compromise"" fosters a collaborative tone and encourages Bob to reconsider his position. 
* **Room for further negotiation:** There's still room to negotiate if Bob is unwilling to accept this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,600,000 is still out of my reach.  Let's try $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I can bring to this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Time is on my side:** I have 6 rounds remaining, and there's still potential to get a better deal.
* **Avoiding a bad deal:** Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss for me.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $950,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. While I'm willing to be flexible, I can't go any lower than $1,300,000. This price still represents a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the potential benefits you'll realize from this product."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair stance:**  I'm sticking to a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price but still lower than my initial offer. 
* **Emphasis on value:** I reiterate the product's worth to Bob, reminding him of its benefits. 
* **Closing the gap:**  My counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate but also communicates that I won't settle for a price that's significantly below my minimum.
* **Building towards a deal:**  By demonstrating flexibility while remaining firm, I'm hoping to nudge Bob closer to accepting a price that's favorable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $1,050,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Time is running out:** I have only 4 rounds remaining. 
* **Hoping for a better offer:** While I could sell to John for $1,500,000, I'm still holding out for a better deal with Bob. I believe there's still potential to get closer to my desired price.

I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a price that's more favorable to me."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a solution that works for both of us. I appreciate your willingness to go higher, but $1,050,000 is still below the value of this product.  Considering the significant benefits it offers, I'm willing to drop my price further to $1,200,000. This is a final offer, and I believe it's the best we can do to reach a mutually agreeable agreement.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer approach:** I'm aiming to create a sense of urgency by presenting this as a final offer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close.  $1,200,000 is still a bit too much for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,100,000.  I'm confident this product will be very valuable for me, and this price feels fair. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate a better deal with Bob.
* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $1,100,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Guarantee a good outcome:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of a worse deal with Bob. 

While I'd prefer to get a higher price, it's more prudent to secure a guaranteed profit by selling to John."
