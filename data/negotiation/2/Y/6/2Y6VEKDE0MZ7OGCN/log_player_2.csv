{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You're willing to pay up to $150, but Alice is asking for $120.  This means you have room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal.
* **More rounds available:** You have 10 rounds, so there's time to negotiate and try to lower the price.

**Next Steps:**

You'll now make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to your $150 limit."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Lowering the price:** The counteroffer drops the price by $10, showing Alice you're serious about negotiating.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** The counteroffer is a compromise between Alice's previous offer ($125) and your last offer ($110). This shows you're willing to meet halfway.
