"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always a good idea to try and negotiate before resorting to the backup option.  $6,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for improvement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by 25%. This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal and also leaves room for negotiation.  If Alice rejects, I can adjust my offer in subsequent rounds based on her response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my initial counteroffer, but I'm still not satisfied. There's still room for negotiation. I'll counter again to try and push the price lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to split the difference between my last offer and Alice's current offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still trying to get a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I could keep negotiating, Alice's offer of $5,200 is now significantly lower than John's price of $10,000. This is a good deal for me, and it's likely that further negotiation won't yield a much better price. It's time to secure the purchase."
