Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is better than his first, it's still below my minimum. I'll reject it and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $11,000 to make this work. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that. How about we meet at $10,800? I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,800 is closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. I'll reject the offer and try to get closer to my minimum in the next round.  I'm hoping that Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to pay more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to be reasonable, and I appreciate that. However, I can't go any lower than $11,200. This is a fair price considering the product's worth.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 11200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to get a fair price, but $11,200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,800 and $11,200, which is $11,000. Can we do that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum.  Accepting this offer will secure a sale and avoid the risk of losing the deal altogether, especially with only a few rounds remaining."
