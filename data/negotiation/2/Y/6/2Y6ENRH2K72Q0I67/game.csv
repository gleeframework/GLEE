,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $11,000 to make this work. Let's meet in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that. How about we meet at $10,800? I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget.",10800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to be reasonable, and I appreciate that. However, I can't go any lower than $11,200. This is a fair price considering the product's worth.  Let's finalize this deal.",11200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a fair price, but $11,200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,800 and $11,200, which is $11,000. Can we do that?",11000.0,Bob,6,
