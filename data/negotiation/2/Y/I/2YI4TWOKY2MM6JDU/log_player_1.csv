Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($80).
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming for a price closer to his maximum valuation increases your potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $120 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer while still ensuring a significant profit margin for you.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a fallback option with John at $80, so you're not desperate and can afford to aim higher with Bob."
