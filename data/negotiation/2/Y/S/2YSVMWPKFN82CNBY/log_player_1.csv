Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth while also offering you a significant return on your investment. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible, but she needs to offer Bob an incentive to buy.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping Alice well above her minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price and make it more appealing to Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** Bob would ideally want to pay $1,000,000 or less. Alice's offer is significantly higher, but the message attempts to frame it as a worthwhile investment.
* **Negotiation:** This is just the opening offer. Bob might counter-offer, and Alice will need to decide if she's willing to go lower. 
* **John as a Guarantee:**  Alice has a safety net with John. If Bob rejects the offer, she's not losing money. This knowledge gives Alice more leverage in the negotiation."
