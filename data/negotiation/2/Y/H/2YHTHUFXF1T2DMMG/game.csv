"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your position, but $10,000 is quite a bit below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $13,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you be open to $11,000? I think that's a fair offer.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, it seems we are getting closer. I can go as low as $12,500. This is my final offer.",12500.0,Alice,5,
