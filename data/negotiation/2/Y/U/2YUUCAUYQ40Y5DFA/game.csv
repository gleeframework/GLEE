"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1000000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your value for the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer of $850000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $875000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your needs and my minimum requirements.
