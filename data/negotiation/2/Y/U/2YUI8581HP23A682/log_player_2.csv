The product is worth $150 to me, and Alice is offering it for $200. This is a bad deal, so I will reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $200 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $160 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 160}
