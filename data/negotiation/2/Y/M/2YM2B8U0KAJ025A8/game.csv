,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $14000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16000 to make this deal work.  Let's meet in the middle.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $16000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13500. Can you consider it?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $13500 is a good offer, I'm still at my limit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $15000.  This would ensure a good deal for both of us.  What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,5,
