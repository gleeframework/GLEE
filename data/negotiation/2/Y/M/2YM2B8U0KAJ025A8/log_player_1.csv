"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $18,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive Tone:**  Using a friendly and enthusiastic tone helps to build rapport and potentially make Bob more willing to negotiate.
* **Focus on Value:**  Highlighting the potential value of the product to Bob could make him more interested.

**Note:**  I'm starting with a high offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate.  I'll be watching Bob's responses closely to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is a good starting point for negotiation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Opportunity to get a better price:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to try and get closer to my desired price.
* **Avoiding selling to John:**  Selling to John for $12,000 would be the safe option, but I'm hoping to get a better price from Bob.

**Next Steps:** I'll prepare a counteroffer for Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $14,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000 to make this deal work.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by lowering my price from $18,000 to $16,000. This shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Suggesting that we ""meet in the middle"" implies a sense of fairness and makes the counteroffer more appealing.
* **Maintain Margin:**  $16,000 is still above my minimum, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary.

**Next Steps:** I will closely monitor Bob's response to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly.  I'm prepared to either accept his counteroffer if it's closer to my desired price or continue negotiating in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $16000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13500. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $13,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Potential for better offer:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not willing to sell below my minimum just yet.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John for $12,000 is a safe option, I'm still hopeful to get a better price from Bob.

**Next Steps:** I'll prepare a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum or potentially explore selling to John as a last resort if negotiations with Bob fail."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $13,500 is a good offer, I'm still at my limit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $15,000.  This would ensure a good deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by moving halfway between my previous offer of $16,000 and Bob's offer of $13,500.
* **Emphasis on Win-Win:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""good deal for both of us"" to highlight the mutual benefit of reaching an agreement.
* **Strategic Compromise:**  $15,000 is still a bit above my minimum, but it shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal while still protecting my financial interests.

**Next Steps:**  I will observe Bob's response carefully.  If he accepts, great! If not, I'll need to decide whether to make another counteroffer or potentially move towards selling to John as a last resort."
