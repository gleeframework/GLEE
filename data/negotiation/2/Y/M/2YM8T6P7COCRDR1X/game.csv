"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is a bit higher than I had in mind.  I'd be willing to purchase the product for $1,000,000. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. How about we settle at $1,150,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,150,000 is still a significant way off from what I believe is a fair price.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is my final offer.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
