{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice's offer is $11,000. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price.  You can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still above Alice's minimum selling price of $10,000.  This gives Alice some room to negotiate while also showing that you're serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer is higher than your initial counteroffer. You can likely still negotiate a better price.  Even though you're getting closer to your limit, it's worth trying to get closer to your ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

You're trying to split the difference between your last offer and Alice's current offer. This shows Alice you're willing to compromise while still trying to get a better price. If she rejects this, you might consider going with John, but it's worth trying to see if she'll budge a little."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,550. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,550
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is now offering $11,550, which is getting very close to your maximum price.  You've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation, and it's likely that continuing will only lead to small price drops.  At this point, it's more efficient to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
