"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $8,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the price down as much as possible. He knows the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so offering $8,500 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying but wants a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $9,000, which is a good deal for Bob.  While he could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and potentially raising the price again.  

Accepting the offer at $9,000 saves Bob $1,000 compared to buying from John, which aligns with his goal of saving money."
