"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a unique product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $8000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $10000.  It's a great opportunity to own something truly special. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum budget, so there's no immediate advantage to accepting. Since you can get the same product from John for the same price, rejecting Alice's offer allows for potential negotiation with her or exploration of other options."
