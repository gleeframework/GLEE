# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I know you'll find valuable, for $130. I think it's a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

Alice's offer is too high. You can try to get a better price by rejecting it, hoping she will come down. You're willing to pay up to $150 from John, so you have some room to negotiate."
