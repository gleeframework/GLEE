"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $12,000 is a good starting point, but Bob can likely do better.  He has 10 rounds and the option to buy from John as a safety net, so it makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer, aiming to get closer to Alice's value of $10,000.  This shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but wants to pay a fair price. The offer is still within Bob's budget and gives Alice room to negotiate if she wants to."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is a good compromise. It's still within Bob's budget, and it's likely a fair price considering Alice's minimum value.  Bob is likely to save money by buying from Alice rather than John.  There is potential for more negotiation, but the risk of losing the deal to another seller (or Alice being unwilling to budge further) makes accepting the offer the best decision at this point."
