Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that our product is worth more than $1,050,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,100,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to reach a deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer is $1,125,000, which is still above your target price of $1,000,000. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John for $1,000,000 and save yourself $125,000. While you might be able to negotiate further with Alice, the risk of her rejecting your offer and ending the negotiations is high. It's more prudent to secure the product at a guaranteed price from John."
