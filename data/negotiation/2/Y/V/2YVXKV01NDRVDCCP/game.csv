"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a price below its worth to you, and I get a fair price for my investment. Let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of a price more around $1,100,000. I'm willing to make a compromise to get this deal done, but I need to make sure it's worth my while. Can you meet me at that price?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about we settle at $1,125,000?  This would ensure a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know what you think.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down a bit more, but $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,125,000, so I'm offering $1,112,500. Can you consider this price?",1112500.0,Bob,4,
