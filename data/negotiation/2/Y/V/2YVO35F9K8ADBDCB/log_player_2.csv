{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are nearing the end of the negotiation process.  Alice is only willing to go down to $915,000, which is still higher than my target price. With only one round remaining, the chances of getting a lower price are slim. I'm not willing to risk it, and I'm also concerned that if we reach the 10th round, Alice might increase the price again. Since I have a backup option with John, I'll buy the product from him for $1,200,000. Even though it's not the ideal price, it's still within my budget and I can avoid further negotiation."
