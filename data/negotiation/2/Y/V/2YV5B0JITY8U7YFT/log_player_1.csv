Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am currently working within a budget of $800,000 for this purchase. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. While $1,200,000 is better than his initial offer, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price.  I have 10 rounds, and I believe I can get closer to my goal."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  We've reached a point where my previous counteroffers have been rejected, and while I'd prefer to get closer to $1,500,000, accepting Bob's offer at $1,300,000 is still a good outcome.  It's above my minimum acceptable price, and I'm happy to close the deal rather than risk further negotiations."
