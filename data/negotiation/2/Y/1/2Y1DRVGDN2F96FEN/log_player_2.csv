"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $15,000, but $12,000 is still a significant markup from the product's value to Alice ($8,000). 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You have 10 rounds and the ability to counteroffer, so you can try to get a better price.
* **Buying from John is a last resort.**  While it's an option, it's not the best choice at this point. You want to try to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint offer:** This offer splits the difference between Alice's asking price ($12,000) and your maximum price ($15,000), offering a significant discount for Alice while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer helps gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and provides a starting point for further bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above your desired price range.  
* **Further negotiation is possible.** You have 7 rounds left, and you've already demonstrated your willingness to negotiate.  
* **Buying from John is still not the best option.**  You're getting closer to your goal price with each round of negotiation.

**Next Steps:**  You should try to counteroffer with a price that is still lower than Alice's offer but higher than your initial offer.  This will show Alice that you're serious about negotiating but also that you're willing to walk away if the price doesn't meet your needs."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer is a compromise between Alice's last offer ($13,000) and your previous offer ($9,500). It shows a willingness to meet halfway, but also suggests you're not willing to go much higher. 
* **Moving closer to the goal:** This price is still within your acceptable range and closer to your desired price point.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  You're still leaving room for negotiation, as Alice has shown a willingness to lower her price.

**Strategy:** This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and create a sense of urgency for Alice to accept. You're showing flexibility, but also holding firm on your price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's slightly lower than her previous offer, it's still above your desired price range and closer to John's price.
* **Further negotiation is still possible.** You have 5 rounds left, and you've shown a willingness to negotiate, so Alice may be open to lowering her price further.
* **Buying from John is becoming more tempting.** The gap between Alice's offer and John's price is closing, and you have fewer rounds to negotiate.

**Next Steps:** You should counteroffer with a price that is still lower than Alice's offer but closer to your desired price point. This will show Alice that you're serious about negotiating, but you're also willing to consider alternative options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** This offer is a compromise between Alice's current offer ($13,500) and your previous offer ($11,000). It shows that you are willing to negotiate further but are approaching your upper limit.
* **Urgency:** With only 4 rounds remaining, this counteroffer puts pressure on Alice to come to an agreement.
* **Balancing risk:** While buying from John is becoming more appealing, this counteroffer allows you to continue exploring a potential deal with Alice while minimizing the risk of missing out on a better price. 

**Strategy:** By offering a price closer to Alice's last offer, you are demonstrating a willingness to reach a compromise while still pushing for a lower price. This should encourage Alice to respond with a final offer closer to your desired price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** The price is very close to John's, leaving little room for further negotiation.
* **Limited time:** You only have 3 rounds remaining, making it unlikely to get a better offer from Alice.
* **Minimizing risk:** Buying from John guarantees you the product for a price within your budget. 

**Strategy:**  While it's not ideal, buying from John at this point minimizes the risk of not getting the product and losing valuable time in negotiations. You've tried your best to negotiate a lower price, but Alice's unwillingness to budge makes it more sensible to secure the product from a reliable alternative."
