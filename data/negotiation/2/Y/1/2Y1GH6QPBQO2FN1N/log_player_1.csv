"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value, but still leaving some room for negotiation. This maximizes my potential profit.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  A $500 gap leaves space for Bob to make a counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. 
* **Protecting my minimum:**  This offer is well above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer is a starting point. I'll observe Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly, keeping in mind my goal of maximizing profit while also considering the risk of losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's above my absolute minimum of $8,000, it's still significantly lower than my desired price point. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe I can still get closer to my target price of $9,500. 
* **No urgency to sell:**  I haven't reached the 10th round, and I have a backup option in John, who is willing to pay $8,000.

**Strategy:**

I will counter with a price that is closer to my initial offer, but still shows flexibility.  I want to see if I can push Bob a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer splits the difference between my initial offer of $9,500 and Bob's offer of $8,500. 
* **Showing flexibility:** This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also remaining firm on my desired price.
* **Leaving room for one more counteroffer:**  There's still some room for Bob to make a counteroffer without having to accept my price immediately. This keeps the negotiation moving.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to secure the deal. If Bob rejects, I'll have to consider if I want to make another counteroffer, or if it's more advantageous to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below target:** While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous offer, it's still significantly lower than my target price of $9,000.
* **Limited room for improvement:**  There's not much room for Bob to increase his offer further without reaching a point where it's no longer beneficial for him.
* **Time is running out:** We are already in Round 4, and the closer we get to the 10th round, the greater the risk of losing the deal entirely.

**Strategy:**

I will counter with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, aiming to close the gap and reach a mutually acceptable price.  I'll carefully consider the risk of losing the deal if Bob continues to reject my offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8900}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer is a compromise between my last offer of $9,000 and Bob's current offer of $8,700. It shows a willingness to meet him halfway while still protecting my profit margin.
* **Closing the gap:** This offer significantly reduces the price difference and creates a greater chance of a deal being struck. 
* **Limited room for negotiation:** There is less space for further negotiation, and I'm willing to consider accepting Bob's offer if he rejects this one.

**Strategy:**

I'm pushing for a deal in this round.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to accept his offer in the next round, as I'm concerned about running out of time and potentially losing the deal to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the gap:** Bob's offer is only $100 less than my last counteroffer of $8,900.  This is a small difference and demonstrates his willingness to compromise.
* **Time is running out:**  We are in Round 6, and the risk of losing the deal to John is increasing with each round.
* **Minimizing potential loss:** Accepting Bob's offer will result in a profit of $800, which is better than selling to John for $8,000. 

**Strategy:**

While I would prefer to secure a higher price, it's more important at this point to close the deal and avoid further risk. I believe this offer represents a good balance between maximizing profit and minimizing potential loss."
