"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal for both of us! What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is higher than what John is offering. I should try negotiating a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While closer to a reasonable price, $105 is still more than I want to pay. I'll counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate further."

""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we split the difference and settle at $97.50?"",
