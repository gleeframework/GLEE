Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to let it go for $110. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially get closer to Bob's maximum value ($120).
* **Gauging Interest:** The message aims to gauge Bob's interest while also establishing the product's value in his eyes. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By offering it at $110, we leave room for either Bob to accept, or counter-offer, giving us more information to work with. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** How Bob responds will be crucial in determining the next step. If he immediately accepts, we know we could have potentially gone higher. If he counter-offers, we can adjust our strategy accordingly.
* **John's Offer:**  We always have the safety net of John's $80 offer. This means we should never accept anything less from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a decent profit, we have room to negotiate further. Bob's counter-offer suggests he's interested but trying to get a better deal.  We started high, so we expected some back and forth.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and lets us guide him closer to a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This classic negotiation tactic often feels fair to both parties.  It shows we're willing to compromise but also holds firm on a price above our minimum.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** By countering with $100, we are still significantly above John's offer, giving us leverage in the negotiation.
* **Encouraging a Quick Close:**  By proposing a price close to the middle ground, we might encourage Bob to accept quickly, avoiding further back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short on budget, but I'm willing to go up to $95. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $95 is a good profit, exceeding our minimum price by $15. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While we could potentially squeeze a few more dollars out of Bob, it's unlikely he'll go much higher.  Further negotiation risks him walking away.
* **Time Value:**  Each round of negotiation takes time. Accepting now secures the profit and allows us to move on to other potential deals."
