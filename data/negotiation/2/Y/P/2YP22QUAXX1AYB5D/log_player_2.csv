"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1100000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows for both of us to make a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $1050000. Considering the value of the product to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1075000. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's goal, it's still higher than what he'd like to pay. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should aim to get the price even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to pay. I'm willing to offer $1,025,000 for the product. I believe this offer is fair and reflects the value to both of us. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $1025000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1070000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,070,000 is still higher than Bob's target price of $1,000,000.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating,  Alice has indicated this is her ""final offer."" This means further negotiation might be fruitless.  

At this point, buying from John for $1,000,000 is the most financially sound decision, as it guarantees Bob achieves his goal of getting the product for under $1,000,000.  There's no guarantee that Alice will budge further, and continuing to negotiate carries the risk of running out of rounds with no deal."
