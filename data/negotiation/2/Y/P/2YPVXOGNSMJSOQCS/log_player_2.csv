Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price for it. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $1,450,000. I'm thinking of a price of $1,525,000. This is a compromise that should work for both of us.
