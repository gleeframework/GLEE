Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. While I see its potential,  $1,600,000 is unfortunately beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,450,000 for it. This reflects its value to me while remaining within my financial constraints. Let me know what you think.
