(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$500,000 is a very good price, but I can likely get it for even less. I want to see if I can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a low counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  $300,000 is significantly lower than her initial offer, but it's still within a reasonable range for a potential deal. If she rejects this, I'll adjust my counteroffer based on her reaction."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $400,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, I'm still hopeful to get it for less. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, so I'll increase my counteroffer slightly to $350,000. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but am still trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is steadily increasing her offers, indicating she's serious about selling. While $450,000 is still above my ideal price, it's a significant improvement from her initial offer, and I'm running out of time. Accepting now gives me a good deal without risking further negotiation and potentially losing the opportunity to buy at this price."
