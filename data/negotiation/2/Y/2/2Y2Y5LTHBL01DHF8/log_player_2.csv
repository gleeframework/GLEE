"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $15000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since your maximum budget is $15,000, and Alice is offering the product at that price, there's no immediate benefit to accepting her offer. You can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'd be happy to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $14000, which is a significant discount from the original price. Is that something you'd be comfortable with? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered the price to $14,000, which is within your budget. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might not budge further, or you might end up buying from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible choice in this situation."
