"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs. I'm asking for $16,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $16,000 is too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's asking price. This gives me room to negotiate upward and still potentially get a price well below my $8,000 limit.
* **Polite and Interested:** My message is polite and expresses continued interest in the product. This helps maintain a positive tone for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice came down from her initial offer, $14,000 is still significantly more than my $8,000 limit and the $8,000 I could spend buying from John.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still room for negotiation. Alice seems willing to move on price, so I'll continue to counter-offer in hopes of getting closer to my target range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $14,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,000. That's a significant jump from my previous offer, and I hope it demonstrates my seriousness about buying the product."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** I'm increasing my offer, but only to $7,000. This keeps me well below my $8,000 limit and John's price.
* **Show Willingness:** The larger increase ($1,000) shows Alice I'm willing to move towards a deal, but I'm not budging too much, too quickly.
* **Justification:** I'm justifying the increase to keep the negotiation focused on value and finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the price you're offering is still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $12,500. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated that $12,500 is her final offer. This means further negotiation with her is unlikely to result in a price I'm willing to pay.
* **Over Budget:** Even with her final offer, the price is still significantly higher than my $8,000 limit.
* **John's Price is Better:**  I have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $8,000. It makes no sense to pay more when I can get the product for my target price elsewhere."
