Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $14,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Fairness and appeal:** The message emphasizes fairness and encourages Bob to consider the deal. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message leaves the door open for Bob to make a counteroffer. 
* **John as leverage:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me the power to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I really like the product, but I have a budget to stick to. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $12,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation opportunity:**  I believe I can still get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer. 
* **John's offer as leverage:**  Having John's offer as a fallback ensures that I won't be forced to accept an unfavorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,500 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $13,250? This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still being fair to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Appeal to reason:** The message highlights the compromise and emphasizes the fairness of the offer.
* **Positive tone:** The message remains friendly and positive, encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation. 
* **John's offer as leverage:** I still have John's offer as a fallback in case Bob rejects this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $13,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $13,000 is only $2,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a chance that Bob will walk away, or we could get stuck in a prolonged negotiation.
* **Time is valuable:** It's been a few rounds of negotiation already, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.

**Conclusion:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $13,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's a decent profit for me and allows me to avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation."
