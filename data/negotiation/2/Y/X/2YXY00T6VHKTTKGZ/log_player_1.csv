Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  Offering $100 allows for some bargaining without dropping below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Positive tone:**  Using a friendly and encouraging message can help build rapport and make Bob more likely to negotiate. 
* **Not going to John immediately:** I'm still willing to negotiate with Bob, but I have the option to go to John if the deal falls through. This gives me leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  I have the option to counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **John is a backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me the confidence to reject Bob's offer and try for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand you're looking for a lower price, $85 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95?  I think it's a fair price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but not completely shutting down the negotiation. 
* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a compromise price that's closer to my desired price but still acknowledging Bob's perspective.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and professional tone to encourage Bob to continue negotiating. 
* **Still above my minimum:** $95 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $95 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $90 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Bob's final offer:** Bob has stated this is his final offer, so there's a good chance further negotiation won't yield a better price.
* **Risk of losing the sale:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk he might walk away, and I might end up selling to John for $120, which is only slightly better.
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing the negotiation could take more time and effort, and $90 is a reasonable price considering the circumstances."
