"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob can get the product for $12,000 from John.  Since Alice's offer is $11,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting and counter-offering. There's a chance he can get the product for even less than $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. He knows the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, so he's offering a price slightly above that, hoping Alice will accept. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,200 is only $200 more than Bob's counteroffer of $10,500.  It's a good deal for Bob compared to buying from John for $12,000.  There's a good chance that continuing to negotiate won't get Bob a significantly better price, and he risks Alice walking away from the deal entirely."
