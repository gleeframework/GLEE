"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's in great condition and worth a lot more than that. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $140? That's a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference and settle on $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $125 is still a bit low for me.  I'm happy to keep negotiating, but let's try $135.  This feels like a good compromise.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price.  How about we meet in the middle at $130? That's my final offer.",130.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, but $130 still isn't quite right for me. Let's try $132.50. This is a very fair compromise, and we can close this deal.",132.5,Alice,7,
