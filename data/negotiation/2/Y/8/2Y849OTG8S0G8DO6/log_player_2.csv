"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me, and I think it would be valuable to you as well. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below your maximum price ($150), there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested, $140 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $130.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $130 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $135?  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $140 to $135, which is closer to my target price.  While I could potentially continue negotiating, there's a risk that she'll become less willing to compromise or that I'll end up paying more with John.  Accepting the offer at $135 is a reasonable compromise that saves me $15 compared to buying from John."
