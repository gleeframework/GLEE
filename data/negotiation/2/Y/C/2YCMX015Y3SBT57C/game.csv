"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $9,500 to make this worthwhile. How about $9,750? It's a fair price that still allows you to get a great product.",9750.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
