Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's better to try and negotiate with Alice or buy from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $175 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can sell the product to you for $137.50. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

While $137.50 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice or simply going with John for a guaranteed lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're serious about getting the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you at $125. It's a good compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125.

Alice is still asking for more than I'm willing to pay. While $125 is a better price than her previous offers, it's still above my limit. At this point, it's more worthwhile to go with John's offer and secure the product for $100."
