"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.  Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm trying to be mindful of my budget, and I'm not sure if I can stretch to $14,000. Can you consider meeting me in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $12,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $13,500? This would still allow me to make a decent profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know if you're interested.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, Alice. However, $13,500 is still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, which would be $12,750. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. Can you consider this offer?",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $12,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. Let's meet in the middle again, at $13,250. I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to get what we want. What do you say?",13250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,250 is still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $12,500. I think this is a fair price that balances both our interests. Can you accept this offer?",12500.0,Bob,6,
