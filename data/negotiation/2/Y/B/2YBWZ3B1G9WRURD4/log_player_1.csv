"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation and still gives me a healthy profit. I'm confident that Bob will be willing to negotiate, as the product is worth $1,500,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}

I'm going to counteroffer at $1,700,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a profitable price for me. I believe this is a fair offer that Bob will be likely to accept."
