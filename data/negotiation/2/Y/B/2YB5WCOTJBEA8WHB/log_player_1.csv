Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Reasonable Starting Point:**  Offering it at $150 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. It also significantly increases your potential profit if he accepts. 
* **Leaving John as Backup:** If Bob rejects the offer, you're not losing anything because you can still sell it to John for your minimum acceptable price."
