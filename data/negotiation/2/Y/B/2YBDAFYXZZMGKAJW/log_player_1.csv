Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $175 is still too much for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $100. It's fair for both of us, and I'm ready to buy it right now.

Bob is clearly anchored at $100 and unlikely to budge. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
