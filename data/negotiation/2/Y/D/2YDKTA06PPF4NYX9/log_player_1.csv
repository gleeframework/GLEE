Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  At $1,100,000, it's still a good deal for Bob, as he values it at $1,000,000.
* **It's below your minimum:** It's above your minimum of $1,200,000, giving you some room to negotiate if needed.
* **It shows you're willing to compromise:** This demonstrates that you're open to negotiation, making Bob more likely to engage.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000 for your product. I believe this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price. I'm going to see if I can get a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000. This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to where I need to be. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1080000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to consider $1,070,000 as a counteroffer for your product. This is the highest I can go while still staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $1,070,000 is a decent offer, it's still below what I want to get.  I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potential for more rejected offers. John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, so I'm going to go with him."
