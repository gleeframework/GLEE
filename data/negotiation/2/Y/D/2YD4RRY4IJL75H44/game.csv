"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. Considering the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000. This price is a fair compromise that allows us both to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, $1,200,000 is still a bit below my desired value for this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,300,000. This offer is fair and allows us both to benefit from this deal.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
