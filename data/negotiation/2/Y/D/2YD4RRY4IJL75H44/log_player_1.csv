Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. Considering the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000. This price is a fair compromise that allows us both to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $1,200,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll try to negotiate a bit higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, $1,200,000 is still a bit below my desired value for this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,300,000. This offer is fair and allows us both to benefit from this deal.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
