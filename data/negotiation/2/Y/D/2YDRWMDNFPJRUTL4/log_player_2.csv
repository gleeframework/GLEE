* There is no guarantee that Alice will accept Bob's counteroffer in the final round, and the risk of losing the deal is high.
* Buying from John for $1,200,000 is a guaranteed purchase, ensuring that Bob gets the product, even though it's at a higher price.
* This decision is a calculated risk, weighing the potential savings from further negotiation with the certainty of securing the product."
