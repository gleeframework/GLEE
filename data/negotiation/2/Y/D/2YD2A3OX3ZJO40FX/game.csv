"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm afraid I can't quite meet you at $90. I'm willing to come down to $110, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $110 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100. Can you consider that?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob! I'm willing to compromise, but I think $100 is still a bit low for the product's value. I can do $105, but that's as low as I'm willing to go.",105.0,Alice,5,
