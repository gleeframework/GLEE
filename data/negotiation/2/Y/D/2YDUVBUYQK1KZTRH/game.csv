"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product.  However,  $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $975,000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, allowing you to make a good profit while giving me a price I'm comfortable with.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but $975,000 is cutting it too close. This product is truly one-of-a-kind, and its value is reflected in my pricing.  How about we settle at $1,000,000 even? That's my final offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,000,000 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial solution.  Let's try $985,000. This price represents a significant saving for me while still allowing you a respectable profit.",985000.0,Bob,6,
