"I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $145. Would you be willing to go up to that price?",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to go up to $135, but no higher. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",135.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $135, Bob, but I'm not quite there yet. I can do $142, which is the closest I can get to my target price without going too far below it. What do you think?",142.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm still not comfortable going above $135. Would you be willing to meet me halfway between $135 and $142, which would be $138.50?",138.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I like the way you think, Bob! Meeting us halfway between $135 and $142 is a fair compromise. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $138.50. How about $139.50? It's a small step up from your offer, but it's still a good compromise for both of us.",139.5,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $135. Would you be willing to meet me at $136.50? It's just a small step up from my original offer, and I think it's a fair compromise for both of us.",136.5,Bob,10,
,,Alice,10,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, Bob! However, I still need to make a bit more profit. How about $140? It's a small step up from your last offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",140.0,Alice,11,
