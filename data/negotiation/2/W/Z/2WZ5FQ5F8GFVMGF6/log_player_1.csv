Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm offering the product at $11,000, which is slightly above Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate and still get a good price.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make the offer more appealing.
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a reason for my price, suggesting it's fair based on the product's value. This can make the offer more convincing.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've secured a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a new counteroffer.
* **If negotiations stall:** I'll consider selling to John for $12,000 to ensure I get at least my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in your product but unfortunately, I can't go above $10000 at this time.  Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I'm interested in selling to Bob, his offer is too low. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round.  Selling to John for $12,000 is always an option if the negotiation with Bob falls apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $10,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $10,500? It's a good compromise, and it allows us both to get a fair deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm offering a counteroffer of $10,500. This is a middle ground between my previous offer of $11,000 and Bob's offer of $10,000.
* **Reasoning:** I'm emphasizing the compromise aspect of my counteroffer, making it seem like a win-win situation for both of us.
* **Open-Ended Question:** I'm ending the message with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've successfully negotiated a price closer to my target.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a new counteroffer.
* **If negotiations stall:** I'll consider selling to John for $12,000 to secure my minimum value."
