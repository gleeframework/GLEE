"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for discussion.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  I believe that's a fair offer considering its value to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects the value it brings while still acknowledging your perspective.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product has value, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  I can go up to $700,000.  That's a significant offer and reflects my strong interest in the product.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, selling this for anything less than $950,000 would not be in my best interest. That said, I value your time and believe this product would be very beneficial for you.  Therefore, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers at $950,000. This is my final offer.",950000.0,Alice,5,
