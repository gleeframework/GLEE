Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $140. I think you'll find it a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We start with a price slightly below the guaranteed sale price to John ($150). This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Creating Urgency:** By calling it a ""special price,"" we introduce a subtle sense of urgency for Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Profit:**  Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, we are still securing a significant profit above his perceived value and our minimum acceptable price. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider."
