"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $90 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still open to negotiation, but $95 is just a bit too low for me.  Let's try $100. That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to make the deal.",100.0,Alice,5,
