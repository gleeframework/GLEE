{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you!  I'm asking $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is above Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but below my minimum of $12,000, giving him room to negotiate. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message positive and highlight the potential value of the product for Bob. This makes him more likely to consider the offer and engage in the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to start with a higher price, but still leave room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially secure a higher price, while also allowing Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal. If Bob rejects the offer, I can adjust my counteroffer based on his counter-proposal. Ultimately, I can always fall back on John's offer of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my desired price point. I'm going to reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my $10,000 asking price. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I don't want to settle for a price significantly lower than my initial offer. 
* **John's Offer:**  I have a safety net with John's offer of $12,000, so I can afford to be more aggressive with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you making a counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which reflects the value I know this product will bring you. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've lowered my price by $500 to $9,500.  This is still above Bob's offer and closer to my desired price point.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and stating my willingness to compromise while maintaining the value proposition of the product. This shows that I'm open to negotiation and keeps the conversation friendly.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a compromise that is both acceptable to Bob and keeps my earnings above my minimum.  This counteroffer shows flexibility while still maintaining a position of strength."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,250. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,250 is still below my initial asking price of $10,000, it's significantly closer to my minimum of $12,000 and is a decent compromise.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject this offer, I risk losing Bob as a buyer entirely.  He might decide to walk away and I'll be left with only John's offer.
* **Time Factor:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag out the process, and I might not get a better offer from Bob.
* **Solid Price:** $9,250 is a reasonable price that allows me to secure a sale and avoid potential risks."
