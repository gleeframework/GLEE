"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit stuck. I'm willing to make one final offer, and that's $990000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling to John for $1200000.",990000.0,Alice,7,
