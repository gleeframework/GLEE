{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $12,000 is higher than the $10,000 Bob is willing to pay, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:**  This gives you some wiggle room if Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** This price shows you're serious about selling to Bob, but you're not desperate.

Keep in mind that this is just the first step in the negotiation. You'll need to be prepared to respond to Bob's counteroffers and potentially make concessions to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't accept such a low offer at this point.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a good deal for both of us, and it reflects the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $11,000. I'd like to meet you in the middle, but at $10,500. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, I'm still not willing to sell for that price.  It's still significantly below the value I place on the product.  I'm going to counter with one last offer, and if Bob rejects it, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to be fair, but $10,500 is still too low for me. This is my final offer: $11,500. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for me. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll be moving on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a reasonable profit, but I'm really not willing to go above $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has made it clear he won't go higher than $10,500.  I'm not willing to compromise further, as that price is too low for me.  It's time to move on to John and secure the $15,000 price."
