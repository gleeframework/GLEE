"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $9,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can save at least $500 by rejecting Alice's offer and counter-offering.  You have room to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $9,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm looking for a bit more than that.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $9,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $9,250 is a good deal for you. It's lower than John's price of $10,000, and you've already established a willingness to pay $9,000, so accepting this offer saves you $750."
