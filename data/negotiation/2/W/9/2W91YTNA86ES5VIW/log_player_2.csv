"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than her product's value. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but it's important to start low to give room for negotiation. 
* **Aiming below Value:** My goal is to purchase the product for less than its worth to me ($12,000). Ideally, I want to be closer to Alice's valuation ($8,000) to get a great deal.

This counteroffer gives Alice a chance to respond and sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,500? That's still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you.  Let's find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to her product's value, but $8,500 is still above her valuation. I'm willing to negotiate a bit further before accepting. I believe I can get the price lower without risking losing the deal to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to move up a bit, how about $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting at Alice's Value:**  I'm proposing a price that matches Alice's valuation of the product. This gives her a fair deal while still saving me a significant amount compared to John's offer or Alice's previous offers.
* **Final Offer (for now):** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm signaling that this is a strong offer, and I'm not willing to go much higher. If Alice rejects this, I'll need to seriously consider whether it's worth continuing the negotiation or going with John's offer."
