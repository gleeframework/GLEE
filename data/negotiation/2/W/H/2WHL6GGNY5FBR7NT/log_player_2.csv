"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you at a price of $11,500.  It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since the product is worth $12,000 to Bob,  $11,500 is a decent price, but not the best. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500. I understand it's a great product, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $11,000 to make this worthwhile.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money.  While $11,000 is better than $11,500, it's still more than Bob is ideally looking to pay.  He can try to negotiate further, as he still has several rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground, but $10,750 still doesn't quite work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,875? It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money.  $10,875 is closer to his ideal price, but he's only a few hundred dollars away from his target.  He can try to negotiate further, as he still has several rounds remaining.  It's possible that Alice might be willing to come down a bit more to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to stay within my budget. How about we settle on $10,800? It's a good deal for both of us, and we can avoid further negotiation. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10800}
