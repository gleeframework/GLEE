"Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you at a price of $11,500.  It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny.",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500. I understand it's a great product, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $11,000 to make this worthwhile.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground, but $10,750 still doesn't quite work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,875? It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.",10875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to stay within my budget. How about we settle on $10,800? It's a good deal for both of us, and we can avoid further negotiation. Let's close this deal.",10800.0,Bob,6,
