"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can find something similar within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $95 for the product.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $110. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. I would like to counter with a price of $100 for the product.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're getting close to the price I'm willing to sell it for, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $100 yet. I can offer it to you for $115. This is my best price, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value.",115.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've been considering your proposal, and I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. I would like to counter with a price of $110 for the product.",110.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're getting closer to my price, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go below $115. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'll meet you at $112.50. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise.",112.5,Alice,7,

"Thank you for your last offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $110 for the product.",110.0,Bob,8,

"I'm starting to feel like we're stuck in a loop, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $110, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. I'll throw in a small concession: I'll include a free accessory with the product if you agree to buy it at $110. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",110.0,Alice,9,
