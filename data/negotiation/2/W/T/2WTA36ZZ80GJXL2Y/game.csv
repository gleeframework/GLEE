"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm hoping to keep my spending within $10,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm happy to come down to $11,000. This is still a great value for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $10,500 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up in your offer. However,  $10,500 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,750.  This would give you a great deal on the product while also allowing me to get closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can make this work!",10750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm willing to consider $10,600 as a fair price for the product. I hope this helps us reach an agreement.",10600.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating. I'm going to need to come up a bit higher than $10,600.  $10,800 is the best I can do at this point.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my target. Let's make this happen!",10800.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm willing to agree on $10,700 as a final price for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise for both of us.",10700.0,Bob,8,
