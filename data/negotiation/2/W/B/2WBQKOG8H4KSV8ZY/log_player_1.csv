Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $100.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product for $100. This is a price that is higher than what Bob values the product at, but lower than what John would pay. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob. It also creates a sense of urgency by implying that this is a good deal.

This strategy balances the desire to maximize profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. By offering a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, I increase the chances of him accepting while still getting a good deal. If Bob rejects, I can always sell to John for a higher price."
