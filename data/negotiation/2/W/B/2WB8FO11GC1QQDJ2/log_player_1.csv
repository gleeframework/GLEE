Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it offers significant value, and this is a competitive price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $10,000 as possible. Offering it slightly below my minimum acceptable price creates room for negotiation. 
* **Balance Risk and Reward:** There's a risk Bob will reject the offer, and I'll have to sell to John for $10,000. However, there's also a chance Bob values the product more than $8,000 and is willing to pay a premium.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  By starting at $9,500, I leave myself some wiggle room to potentially lower the price slightly if Bob negotiates. This increases the chances of a successful sale while still aiming for a high profit."
