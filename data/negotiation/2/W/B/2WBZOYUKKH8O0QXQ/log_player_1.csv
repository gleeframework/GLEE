Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident it can make a real difference in your operations. I'm asking for $1,190,000, a price that reflects the true worth of this product.  What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 1190000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since John is guaranteed to buy the product for $1,200,000, Alice's minimum acceptable price is essentially that. However, aiming for the highest possible profit means trying to get a price closer to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** Offering a price of $1,190,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a substantial profit for Alice. This price point creates the impression that Alice is willing to negotiate but also values the product highly.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob and frames the price as a reflection of its worth, not an arbitrary number."
