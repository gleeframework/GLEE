"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I believe it's a game-changer. I'm willing to let it go for $1,500,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,500,000 is a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial proposal, it's still above your budget and the price offered by John. It's worth continuing negotiations to try and get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence and willingness to invest in this product, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,100,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing some flexibility, her offer of $1,200,000 is still higher than John's price of $1,000,000.  It's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice when a guaranteed lower price is available from John."
