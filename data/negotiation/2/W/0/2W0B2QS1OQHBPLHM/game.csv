"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I believe it's a game-changer. I'm willing to let it go for $1,500,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"While I appreciate your enthusiasm and see the potential in this product, $1,500,000 is unfortunately out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it, which is a substantial sum and reflects the value I see in it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,500,000 is a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000. This is a significant investment for me and demonstrates my commitment to acquiring this product. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence and willingness to invest in this product, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,100,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
