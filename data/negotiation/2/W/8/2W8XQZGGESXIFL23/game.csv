"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $150. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you. However, I still think the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $135. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Can you consider that?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $125 is still a bit above your target, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $130. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that?",125.0,Bob,6,

"I've already offered you $130, Bob, and I'm not willing to go any lower than that. However, I'm willing to throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium service package that's worth $10. This will bring the total value to $140. I think this is a fair price for the product and the added service. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the added value you're offering, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product, and I'm willing to forgo the premium service package. Can you consider that?",125.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've already offered you a premium service package worth $10, Bob, and I'm not willing to give that up. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway on the price. I'll offer you the product for $127.50. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for the product and the added value. What do you think?",127.5,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product, and I'm willing to forgo the premium service package. If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $80. I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a better deal.",125.0,Bob,10,
