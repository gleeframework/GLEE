Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm aiming to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go.  I'll adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to take the $12,000, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him closer to my desired price range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm countering with $17,000. This is a compromise,  moving closer to Bob's offer but still leaving room for negotiation. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to be flexible while also maintaining a price point that's closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I would have preferred to get more, I'm happy to accept this offer. There's a risk that he might reject my counteroffer in the next round, and I might have to settle for selling to John at the same price. It's more advantageous to close the deal now and secure the $15,000."
