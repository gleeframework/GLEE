"Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $7,500.  He has a clear alternative with John at $8,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer gives Bob the chance to counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  He knows the product is worth $8,000 to Alice and $8,000 to him.  A counteroffer of $7,000 is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for negotiation and still potentially saving Bob money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $7,200, which is closer to Bob's ideal price.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice might increase the price or even refuse to negotiate further. Accepting the offer guarantees Bob the product for a price lower than John's, which is the best outcome in this situation."
