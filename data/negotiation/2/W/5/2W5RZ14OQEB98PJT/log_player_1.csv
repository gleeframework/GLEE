Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm going to start with my minimum price, as I know I can sell it to John for that amount. It's unlikely Bob will accept this immediately, but it sets the starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum.  I'll reject it and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum price."
