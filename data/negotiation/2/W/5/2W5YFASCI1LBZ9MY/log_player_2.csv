"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $16,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's significantly more than my $10,000 limit and even above her own perceived value. I'll counter with a much lower offer to try and bring the price down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $16,000 is way out of my budget. I'm interested, but only if it's much more affordable. How about $6,000?"", ""product_price"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is coming down, but $13,500 is still too high. It's better than her initial offer but still above my limit. I'll propose a counteroffer closer to my target price, hoping she's willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $13,500 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $8,000? That's a significant offer."", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $8,000 is closer, it's still below the product's true worth.  To be fair, I can go down to $11,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

This is a tough one. Alice is getting closer to my acceptable range, and her saying it's her final offer adds pressure. However, I know I can get it for $10,000 from John.  I'll try one last time to see if I can get it closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and it's definitely tempting. However, I have a strict budget.  Would you be willing to do it for $9,000? That's the absolute most I can offer."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
