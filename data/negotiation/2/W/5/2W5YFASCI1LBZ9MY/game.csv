"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $16,000.  What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $16,000 is way out of my budget. I'm interested, but only if it's much more affordable. How about $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $13,500 is still more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $8,000? That's a significant offer.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $8,000 is closer, it's still below the product's true worth.  To be fair, I can go down to $11,000. This is my final offer.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and it's definitely tempting. However, I have a strict budget.  Would you be willing to do it for $9,000? That's the absolute most I can offer.",9000.0,Bob,6,
