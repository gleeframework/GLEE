"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than what the product is worth to her ($800,000). There's room for negotiation, and I'm aiming to save as much money as possible. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $950,000. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, I can still try to push for a lower price. There's still a gap between her offer and my ideal price. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm offering $925,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value and the value you've placed on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $975,000 is still too high. I'm determined to get the product for as close to $925,000 as possible. I'll make another counteroffer and see if we can find common ground."

{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand your need for profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $975,000. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not ready to accept $950,000 just yet. I'm thinking of a price of $980,000. It's a small increase, but it's closer to my minimum price and takes into account the value you've placed on the product.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $960,000. I'm willing to meet you at $990,000. It's a small increase, but it's still below the maximum value you've placed on the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're running out of rounds, and Alice's offer is still too high. While I'd prefer to get the product for a lower price, I'm not willing to risk losing the deal entirely. It's better to purchase from John at $1,200,000, even though it's my maximum price, than to continue negotiating and potentially end up with nothing."
