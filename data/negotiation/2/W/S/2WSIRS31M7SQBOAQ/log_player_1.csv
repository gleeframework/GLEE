Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. This is a unique asset, and I believe this offer represents a fair starting point for both of us. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is quite limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
We're still significantly above John's offer and have room to negotiate. Bob's offer is quite low, indicating there's potential for a much better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

We're aiming for a compromise here. We came down by $150,000, showing flexibility, while still staying firm above the $1 million mark, which is a significant psychological threshold in this negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I still believe we can find a better middle ground. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,000,000. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're considering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has now hit the $1,000,000 mark, which is a strong offer. While we could potentially push for a bit more, accepting now guarantees a significant profit above our minimum and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
