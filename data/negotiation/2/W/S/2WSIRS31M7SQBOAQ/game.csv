"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is quite limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
