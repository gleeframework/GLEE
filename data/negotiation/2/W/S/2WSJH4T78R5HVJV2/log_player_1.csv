Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since John is guaranteed to buy the product for $1,500,000, Alice wants to see if she can get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below John's price ($1,450,000) creates a strong incentive for Bob. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By mentioning other interested parties, Alice adds a time pressure element that might push Bob towards a decision. 

This strategy aims to balance getting the best possible price from Bob while still having the security of John's offer."
