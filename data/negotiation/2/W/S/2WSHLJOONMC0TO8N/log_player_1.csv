"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* This allows for room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters. 
*  I believe it's important to start high and see how much Bob is willing to pay. 
*  I am also keeping in mind the potential sale to John for $1,000,000 as a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to sell at this price immediately. 

* Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer, and I believe there's still potential to negotiate a higher price.
* I'm going to reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find a middle ground. 
* I'm also considering the value of the product to me, and I'm confident that I can get a better deal than this."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm lowering my price from $1,500,000 to $1,250,000. This is a significant compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* This counteroffer is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it's a more realistic price considering Bob's initial offer. 
* I'm hoping to reach a middle ground with this offer. I'm confident that Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to pay a price closer to this offer.
* I'm also aware that I have 7 rounds left, so I can continue to negotiate if this offer is rejected."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* While $1,100,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied with it. 
* I'm choosing to reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my previous offer. 
* I believe there's still some room for negotiation, and I'm confident that I can get a better price.
* I have 6 rounds remaining, so I'm not under immediate pressure to accept a low offer.
* Selling to John for $1,000,000 is still an option, but I'm hoping to get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm lowering my price again, but only by $50,000. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer. 
* I'm hoping that Bob will see the value of the product and realize that he's getting a good deal at this price.
*  I still have 5 rounds left to reach a deal, so I can afford to be patient and continue to negotiate. 
*  If Bob rejects this offer, I will need to seriously consider selling to John at the $1,000,000 price to avoid risking losing out on a deal altogether."
