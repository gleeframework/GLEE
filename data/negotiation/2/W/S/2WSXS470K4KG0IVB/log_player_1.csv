Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you have a guaranteed buyer at $150, it's always better to aim higher initially.  
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting at $140 leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob if he tries to haggle. 
* **Attractive but Realistic:** The price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but the ""limited time"" and ""special price"" framing might make him reconsider.

This strategy balances the risk of losing Bob with the potential for a higher profit than selling to John directly."
