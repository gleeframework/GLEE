"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see it closer to $10,000 for it to make sense for me. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, however, the price you're offering is unfortunately too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go, I'm willing to increase my offer to $11,000.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about my bottom line.  Would you be willing to do $12,500?  I think that's a fair compromise.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, we're getting closer! I can tell you're serious about finding a fair deal. I'm willing to stretch to $11,500. That's really the best I can do. What do you say?",11500.0,Bob,6,
