It's time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **We've reached a good price:** $515,000 is a significant savings compared to John's $800,000 price. 
* **Limited time:** We're running out of rounds, and Alice is clearly trying to meet us in the middle. 
* **Risk of pushing too far:** If we reject this offer, we risk Alice becoming less willing to negotiate, potentially losing out on a good deal."
