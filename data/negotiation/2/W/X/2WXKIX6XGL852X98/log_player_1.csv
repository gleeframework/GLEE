Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant returns you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since John acts as a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, Alice should aim to get as close to that amount from Bob as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,450,000 leaves room for potential negotiation.  Bob might counter-offer, but Alice knows she has a secure offer from John if Bob refuses.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value and potential, justifying the high price and making it more appealing to Bob."
