""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen.  I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. This offer stands only for a limited time, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower ($1,100,000) with Bob increases the chance of a quicker sale. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing a deal quickly often outweighs waiting for the guaranteed sale. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  The $1,100,000 price leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate upwards, bringing me closer to my ideal selling point. 
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, prompting Bob to make a decision faster."
