# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $600000. What do you think?

You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's value to her ($600,000 vs. $800,000).  It's a good starting point for negotiation, but you can likely get a better price.  There's no need to rush into buying from John yet."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While I'm interested in the product, $600,000 is a bit lower than I'm willing to pay at this point. I'm willing to offer $700,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** My counteroffer is closer to the product's value to Alice, giving her a chance to make a profit.

```
