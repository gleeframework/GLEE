Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and quality.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is a good price for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $10,800. This is still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the extra $800.

Alice is clearly holding firm on her price, and $10,800 is a reasonable compromise.  It's a good deal compared to John's offer, so I'll accept."
