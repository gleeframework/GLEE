"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we bring it down to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to negotiate, but I have to make a profit on this deal. I can see you're willing to pay $800,000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  $950,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. Would you be willing to settle at $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've got to be careful with my pricing. I can meet you at $900,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
