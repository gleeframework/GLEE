Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This is a starting point. I'm offering a price that is less than Bob's perceived value, but still higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, but also allows me to secure a good deal if he accepts. 

I'll be watching closely to see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept and close the deal, I'm aiming for a higher price.  I believe I can still get closer to my desired value by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round to show flexibility and encourage Bob to meet me halfway. This counteroffer is still higher than Bob's current offer but closer to his perceived value. I'm hoping this will lead to a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my target, but it's getting closer.  I've gone through a few rounds of negotiation already, and while I'm not thrilled with the price, it's still a good profit. It's also possible that continued negotiation could lead to a stalemate or me ending up selling to John for less. So, I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the deal."
