"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $10,000 to you, and I believe it's an incredible opportunity. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. This is a special offer considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the deal, but I'm looking to pay closer to my maximum budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I need to maintain a reasonable margin for myself. I am counteroffering at $9,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now within Bob's budget:** $9,000 is less than Bob's maximum of $10,000.
* **Negotiation is likely to continue:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's possible that Alice won't budge much lower, and continuing the negotiation could risk losing the deal. 
* **The risk of going with John:**  Buying from John is a guaranteed price, but it's the highest price option. 

By accepting the offer, Bob gets a good deal while minimizing the risk of losing the opportunity."
