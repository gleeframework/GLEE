"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to work with you, but $1,300,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm happy to buy it for $1,250,000. This is a fair price that's still within my budget, and I believe it reflects the value of the product to me. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,275,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true value, and I believe it's a fair price considering our previous discussions. What do you think?",1275000.0,Alice,3,
