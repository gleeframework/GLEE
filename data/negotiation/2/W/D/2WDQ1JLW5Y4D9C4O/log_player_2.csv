"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  While the offer is within his budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay. There's room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to work with you, but $1,300,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm happy to buy it for $1,250,000. This is a fair price that's still within my budget, and I believe it reflects the value of the product to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,275,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true value, and I believe it's a fair price considering our previous discussions. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he can still try to negotiate further, the price is now within his budget and closer to his desired price.  He's not guaranteed to get a better offer, and there's a risk of the negotiations dragging on and Alice walking away."
