"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product.  It's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business.  I'm willing to let it go for $850,000, a price that reflects its value while leaving room for negotiation.  What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $775,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",775000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $775,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This price still allows me to make a profit while offering you a significant value.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $825,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $800,500. I'm getting close to my target price, and I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle.",800500.0,Bob,4,
