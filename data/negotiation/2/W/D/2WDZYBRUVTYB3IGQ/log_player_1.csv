Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a competitive offer considering its worth in the current market."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob's maximum valuation is $800,000, we don't want to start there.  Beginning with a higher offer leaves room for negotiation and potentially secures a better deal.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's wider market value, implying Bob could be getting a good deal even at this price.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This offer positions us closer to our guaranteed sale price with John ($1,500,000). If Bob rejects this offer, we haven't lost much and can confidently sell to John. 

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. We are prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters."
