"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for the product. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $15,000. Would you consider $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,5,
