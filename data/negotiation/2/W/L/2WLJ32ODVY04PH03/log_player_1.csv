Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential in this product,  $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in purchasing, but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. To be fair to both of us,  how about we settle on $950,000? This is a good middle ground and allows us both to make a good deal. Let me know what you think.
