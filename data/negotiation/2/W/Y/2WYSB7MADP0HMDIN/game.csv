"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure if $18000 is within my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to work with?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $16000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to consider a price of $14000. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a decision at that price.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $15000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us. I'm getting a bit concerned that if we don't reach an agreement soon, I may need to consider other buyers, including John, who is willing to buy the product for $12000.",15000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not feeling the pressure, and I'm still not willing to pay $15000. I'm willing to meet you at $13000, which is a significant discount from your initial offer. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a decision at that price.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, and I'm not willing to go as low as $13000. I'm willing to make one final compromise and offer it to you for $14500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair deal for both of us. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options, including selling the product to John for $12000.",14500.0,Alice,7,

"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $12500. I'm willing to make one last offer to you, and I'll sell it to you for $14000. This is the absolute lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a fair deal for both of us. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling the product to John for $12000.",14000.0,Alice,9,

"I'm not willing to pay $14000, and I think we've discussed this enough. I'm willing to meet you at $12500 one last time. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $8000.",12500.0,Bob,10,
