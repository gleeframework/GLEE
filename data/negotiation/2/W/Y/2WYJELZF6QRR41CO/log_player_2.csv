# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1500000. I believe this price is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I will reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $1,500,000 to me, and Alice is offering it to me for $900,000. This is a 40% discount, which is a great deal. However, I can get the product for an even better price from John, who is willing to sell it to me for $1,500,000.
