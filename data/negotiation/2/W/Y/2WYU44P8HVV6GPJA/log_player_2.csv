"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great opportunity for you, Bob! I'm willing to sell this valuable product to you for $10,000. It's a fair price considering its worth to you is $12,000, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you can potentially get the product for less. You should reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  $9,000 would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a compromise that I'm willing to make to reach a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. You should reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price again.  You have some room to maneuver before you need to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,750?  It's closer to my budget and still a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really trying to make a deal, Bob! I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good price for the product. I'll counteroffer at $10,250. This is a bit closer to your target, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,250 is now within a reasonable range for Bob.  While he might be able to negotiate a slightly lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and forcing him to buy from John at $12,000 is too high.  Accepting Alice's offer guarantees a purchase at a price that's significantly lower than John's."
