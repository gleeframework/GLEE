"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still gives you a significant savings compared to its true value. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference and meet at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $950,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering its worth to you.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
