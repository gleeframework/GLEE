Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $120 to me, I'll offer it to him for $110. This is a reasonable price, considering it's still above its value to him.

{""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Since Bob's offer of $95 is below my minimum price of $110, I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round. I'll make a counteroffer to try to get closer to my desired price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, trying to get closer to my desired price of $110. Since Bob was willing to pay $95, I'll increase the price by $5, making it $100.
