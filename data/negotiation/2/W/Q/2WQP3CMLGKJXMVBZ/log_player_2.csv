You can do better than $110.  You're willing to pay up to $100, so there's room to negotiate.  Let's see if you can get Alice down to your price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}

Let's start with a price of $95. This is a good starting point for negotiation and leaves some room for a compromise."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to your maximum price. There's no point in continuing to negotiate, as you're unlikely to get a better deal.  Accepting her offer is the best choice."
