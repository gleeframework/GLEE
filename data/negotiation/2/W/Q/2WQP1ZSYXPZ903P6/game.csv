"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm interested in the product but I'd be comfortable paying $130. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me. How about $170? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for.",170.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $170 is still a little more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $150, which is my absolute limit. If that works for you, we have a deal.",150.0,Bob,4,
