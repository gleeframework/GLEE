"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $9,500 is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  Would that work for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $7,500?",7500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $7,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you be open to $6,800?",6800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're close, Bob. $6,800 is still a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle again at $7,300?",7300.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we both want to make this deal work. How about we settle at $7,000? That's a fair compromise between our positions.",7000.0,Bob,6,
