"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob! I can do $105, but that's as low as I can go. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this amazing product.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $102.50 was my previous best, but I can do $101.50. That's as low as I can go without losing money on the deal.",101.5,Alice,7,
