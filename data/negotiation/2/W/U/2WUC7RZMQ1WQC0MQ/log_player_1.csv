Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone to build rapport and encourage a deal.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts: Great! I've secured a good deal.
* If Bob rejects: I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counteroffer of my own.
* If the negotiations stall:  I have the option to sell to John for my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I really like the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.**  
* **While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't sell at such a steep discount.**
* **I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $1,400,000.**

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming to find a middle ground that satisfies both of us. 
* If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I will reassess the situation and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget. While I value your interest, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's meet halfway â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's a price I can reasonably accept. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between Bob's offer and my previous offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still staying within a range that's acceptable to me.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value the product holds for him to encourage him to consider my counteroffer.
* **Positive and Open Tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and open to encourage continued negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts: Great! We have a deal.
* If Bob rejects: I'll have to decide whether to make a further counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,250,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make it work within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.**
* **We've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to yield a price that meets my needs.**

**Next Steps:**

* I will contact John and finalize the sale at $1,500,000."
