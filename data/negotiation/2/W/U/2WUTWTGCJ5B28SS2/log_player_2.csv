"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable asset, and I believe it will be a great fit for your needs.  My initial offer is $1,450,000.  This reflects the value I see in the product and also allows for room for negotiation. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $1,200,000.  There's room for negotiation, so I'll reject the offer and try to get a lower price."

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,350,000, but this is still over my budget of $1,200,000.  While it's closer, I'm going to reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  I'm hoping to get closer to my maximum budget with a counteroffer."
