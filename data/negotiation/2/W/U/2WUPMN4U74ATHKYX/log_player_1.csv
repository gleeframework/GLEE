Bob is clearly trying to lowball me and isn't moving significantly towards a price I find acceptable.  It's too risky to continue negotiating, as he might not go much higher than his current offer. Accepting his offer of $1,050,000 would mean losing out on a potential $50,000 profit. Selling to John guarantees my minimum acceptable profit."
