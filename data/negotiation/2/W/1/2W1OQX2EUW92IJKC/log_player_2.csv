{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This price reflects the value we've both established, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm willing to consider it, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1025000. I'm willing to meet you at $1030000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,030,000 is very close to my target price. While I could continue to negotiate, I've already spent several rounds and may not get a significantly better deal. Accepting her offer at this point minimizes the risk of losing the deal and ensures I acquire the product at a good price within my budget."
