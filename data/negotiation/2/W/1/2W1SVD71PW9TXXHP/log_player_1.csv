Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's fair considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $13,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** This price allows for potential counteroffers from Bob without immediately pushing him away. 
* **Setting a Standard:** A clear offer establishes a starting point and demonstrates my seriousness.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message includes an invitation for discussion, encouraging Bob to engage. 

This approach aims to balance maximizing profit with the likelihood of reaching a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value you place on it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired price point.
* **Potential for Higher Counteroffer:**  I believe there's room for a higher counteroffer from me that could potentially land us closer to a mutually agreeable price.
* **Avoiding Settling:**  Selling to Bob for $11,000 would leave me feeling like I settled for less than I could potentially get. 

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer to see if I can secure a better price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  I'm confident this price is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer Strategy:**  By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counter-offer, I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while also showing that I won't settle for a price that is too far below my desired range.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** The offer of $12,000 represents a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer of $13,000 and Bob's offer of $11,000. This strategy shows good faith and encourages Bob to seriously consider my offer.
* **Reiterating Value:**  The message highlights the value of the product, reminding Bob that $12,000 is still a good deal for him, even though it's higher than his initial offer.
* **Openness to Discussion:**  The ending phrase ""Let me know your thoughts"" keeps the negotiation open and invites Bob to continue the conversation."
