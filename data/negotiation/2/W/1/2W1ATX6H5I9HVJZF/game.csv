"I'm interested in the product, but $250 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $180.",180.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $250 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $220. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for this unique product.",220.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $220 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $190. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",190.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $190 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for this product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal.",200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering $190, just like in my previous counteroffer. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",190.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to meet me in the middle, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $210. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $205. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for this product.",205.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, but $205 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $200, which is the same price I offered in round 5. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",200.0,Bob,8,
