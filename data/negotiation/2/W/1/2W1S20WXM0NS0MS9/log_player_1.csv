I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is higher than Bob's estimated value of $15,000, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth at least $15,000 to me.  I'm hoping to negotiate a price somewhere between my minimum and Bob's maximum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $16,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering at $17,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

```

Bob's offer of $16,500 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer, and  it's close enough to my desired price that I'm willing to accept it."
