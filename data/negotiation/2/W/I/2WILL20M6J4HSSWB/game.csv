"I understand that $70 is a good offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $82. It's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",82.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $77.50. Can you consider that?",77.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still willing to work with you, Bob. However, I think $77.50 is a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $82 and $77.50. How about $79.75?",79.75,Alice,5,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $78.63. Can you consider that?",78.63,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob. However, I think $78.63 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to give you a small concession. How about $79.20?",79.2,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, but I'm still comfortable with $78.63. Can you meet me there?",78.63,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit frustrated, Bob. I've already given you a few concessions, and I'm starting to think that $78.63 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to make one more offer. How about $79.40?",79.4,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand you're willing to make one more offer, but I'm still not willing to go above $78.63. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet on this price. Can you meet me at $78.63?",78.63,Bob,10,
