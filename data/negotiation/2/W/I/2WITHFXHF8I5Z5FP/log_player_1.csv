{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking for $110 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Pricing:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum desired value of $100. This allows room for negotiation.  
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer positively, emphasizing the value of the product to Bob and using a friendly tone. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming to get as close to my ideal price as possible while still leaving room for negotiation. 
* This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a better sense of his price point. 
* If Bob rejects my offer, I can then adjust my price or choose to sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $65 is significantly lower than my minimum desired value of $100.  While I want to sell the product, accepting such a low price would be a significant loss.  

**Strategy:**

* Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired value. 
* I'm confident that I can secure a higher price through further negotiation. 
* Selling to John for $100 is still a viable option if I'm unable to reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $65 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a great deal for this fantastic product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm proposing $90, which is still a good deal for Bob, but significantly higher than his initial offer and closer to my desired price.
* **Message:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone while firmly stating my position. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to remind Bob of its worth.

**Strategy:**

* This counteroffer is a compromise that shows flexibility while still protecting my interests.
* I'm hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price within a few rounds of negotiation. 
* If Bob still refuses, I'm prepared to either make a further counteroffer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $75 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $100.  Accepting it would mean taking a loss on the product, which I'm not willing to do.

**Strategy:**

* I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum desired value. I'm confident I can get a better deal through continued negotiation.
* Selling to John for $100 remains a viable option if I can't secure a satisfactory price from Bob."
