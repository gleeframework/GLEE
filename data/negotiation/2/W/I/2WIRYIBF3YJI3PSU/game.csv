"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm looking for.  This product offers a lot of value, and I'm confident it's worth a price closer to my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I see the value in the product, but $14,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $10,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. This product is truly top-notch and I'm confident you'd be very happy with it.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,5,
