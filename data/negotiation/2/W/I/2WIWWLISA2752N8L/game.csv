"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $100. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I can offer you a compromise at $180, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $180 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $140. If you're serious about selling, I think this is a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I can offer you a slightly higher compromise at $160. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $160 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about we split the difference and go with $150?  It's a good price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",150.0,Bob,6,
