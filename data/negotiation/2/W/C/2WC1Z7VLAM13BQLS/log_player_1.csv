{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $12,000 gives me a decent starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Value Proposition:** I highlight the value to Bob to make the offer more appealing. 
* **Flexibility:** This offer allows me to either negotiate with Bob or move on to John if Bob isn't willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,500 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Potential for better deal:**  I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob, or at least a price closer to my minimum. 
* **John is a safety net:** If I can't get a better deal with Bob, I can always sell to John for $15,000."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is just too low. It doesn't reflect the value of this product. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $11,000. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  By offering $11,000, I'm showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Maintaining Value:** $11,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but closer to a price he might be willing to pay, considering his perceived value.
* **Positive Language:**  I use positive language (""Let's make this deal happen"") to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,200 for the product. That's the highest I can go. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob's offer is higher than before, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Potential for higher offer:** I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer, and I might be able to squeeze out a little more.
* **John is the safety net:**  If I can't get a better deal with Bob, selling to John for $15,000 ensures I get my minimum desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up on the price.  However, $10,200 is still a bit too far off from where I need to be.  How about $10,750? This is a good compromise that gets us closer to an agreement.  Let's try to make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** By offering $10,750, I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still staying relatively close to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive Language:** I use phrases like ""good compromise"" and ""make this happen"" to maintain a positive and collaborative tone.
* **Focus on Agreement:** I reiterate the goal of reaching an agreement to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
