,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is just too low. It doesn't reflect the value of this product. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $11,000. Let's make this deal happen.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,200 for the product. That's the highest I can go. Can you meet me in the middle?",10200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up on the price.  However, $10,200 is still a bit too far off from where I need to be.  How about $10,750? This is a good compromise that gets us closer to an agreement.  Let's try to make this happen!",10750.0,Alice,5,
