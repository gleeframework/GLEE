Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget.

Bob's offer is too low.  I need to try to get closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $11,500 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $12,750. This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we can both walk away happy. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, but that's as high as I can go. I really need to save some money on this purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my minimum price. I'm accepting his offer as it's the best I can get from him at this moment. It's still better than selling to John and getting $15,000 as I will get $12,000 from Bob."
