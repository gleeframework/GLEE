"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $11,500 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $12,750. This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we can both walk away happy. Let me know what you think.",12750.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, but that's as high as I can go. I really need to save some money on this purchase.",12000.0,Bob,4,
