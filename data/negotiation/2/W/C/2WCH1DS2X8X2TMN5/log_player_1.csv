{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $120. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($80) but significantly below my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives me room to negotiate while still maximizing my potential profit.
* **Positive tone:** I'm being friendly and highlighting the potential benefit for Bob. This might encourage him to negotiate rather than immediately rejecting. 
* **Leaving room for counter-offers:** By not starting at my absolute minimum, I can potentially gain a higher price through negotiation. 

**Next steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've successfully sold the product.
* **If Bob rejects:** I will analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counter-offer myself.
* **If the negotiations stall:** I will revert to selling the product to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price ($150).** While it's closer to my starting point, it's still not profitable enough for me. 
* **I have a better alternative.** Selling to John for $150 guarantees me a better outcome.
* **Negotiating further with Bob might be risky.** There's no guarantee he will budge further, and I might end up with a lower price or wasting time.

**Next steps:**

* I will proceed to make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to secure a price closer to my desired range.
* If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I will sell the product to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $100 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $115? That's still a good price for you and leaves me some room to make a profit."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's offer.  
* **Reasoning:** I'm justifying my counteroffer by highlighting the potential value for Bob. 
* **Profit margin:**  $115 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I make a profit.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  I've successfully negotiated a reasonable price and will sell the product to Bob.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll have to decide whether to make another counteroffer or sell to John. 
* **If negotiations stall:** I'll sell the product to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'll consider $115 but I'm still looking to stay within my budget of $100. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer of $105 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point of $150. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's a risk that further negotiation with Bob will lead to a lower price or waste time without a guaranteed outcome. 
* **Guaranteed profit with John:** Selling to John for $150 guarantees me a significantly higher profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation.

**Next steps:**

* I will reject Bob's offer and immediately sell the product to John for $150."
