"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $20,000 is above his maximum budget, and he has a better alternative with John.  He should counteroffer Alice to see if he can get a better price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'd be willing to pay $15,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $15000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not quite ready to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $18000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to walk away with if I don't find a better offer. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $18,000 is closer to his budget, it's still above his maximum. He can get the product for $15,000 from John, making John the better option at this point.  Bob should try to counteroffer Alice again, but he should be prepared to walk away and buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $18,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm really serious about getting this product, and I'm ready to pay $16,000.  This is a fair price, and it's the absolute maximum I can offer. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to go with another seller."", ""product_price"": 16000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're serious about getting the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not ready to sell it to you at $16000. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $17500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $15,000.  He has already rejected Alice's offer of $17,500, and he's reached his limit.  Going back and forth with Alice is unlikely to get the price down to his desired amount, and he's guaranteed a better deal from John."
