Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, as I know it would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $12,000.  Let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $8,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $12,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit. Bob might try to haggle the price down, and you can potentially meet somewhere in the middle. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while keeping the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
