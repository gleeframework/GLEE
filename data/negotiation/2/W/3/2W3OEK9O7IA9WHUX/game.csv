"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in your product, but I'd be happy to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we settle on $120? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $120 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $95. If that's not acceptable, I'm afraid I'll have to go with John's offer.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference and go with $107.50. This gives us both a fair deal. If we can't come to an agreement, I may need to consider John's offer.",107.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $107.50 is still too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $98.75? This would be a good compromise for both of us.",98.75,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here.  How about we meet in the middle again at $103.12? That's a fair price for both of us.  If you don't accept, I'm afraid I'll have to take John's offer.",103.12,Alice,7,
