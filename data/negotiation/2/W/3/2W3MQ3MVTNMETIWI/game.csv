"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, but I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000. This still represents a good deal for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while keeping the price within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a reasonable return on my investment. How about $1,300,000? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from the deal. ",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000.  This would allow us both to walk away satisfied with the deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,250,000 still doesn't quite work for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a good compromise that allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome.  Let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
