Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $18,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($12,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Enthusiastic Tone:** A positive message can encourage Bob to engage in the conversation.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message makes it clear that I'm open to discussing the price.

**Strategy:**

* I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. 
* If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counteroffer or consider selling to John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $18000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Meets My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price.
* **No Room for Higher Offers:** It's unlikely I can get a better price from Bob. He's already stated his budget.
* **Risk of Rejection:**  If I reject Bob's offer and counteroffer, there's a risk he'll walk away, and I'll be left with only the $12,000 from John.

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me my minimum desired profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
