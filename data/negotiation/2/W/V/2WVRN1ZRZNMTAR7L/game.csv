"Bob, I have a product I believe will be of great value to you.  It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I understand it holds similar value for you. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This price reflects the unique benefits it offers and my confidence in its potential. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,200,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $950,000 is significantly below the product's true worth.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer a price of $1,050,000. This reflects the value I place on our potential partnership and allows you to acquire a valuable asset without breaking your budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
