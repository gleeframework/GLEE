Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I can't go any lower than $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. While I'm disappointed that I couldn't get Bob to meet my desired price, John's offer guarantees me my minimum acceptable value.  I'm also concerned that continuing to negotiate with Bob could risk him walking away altogether. It's time to cut my losses and move on."
