"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a little steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a starting point to see how flexible Alice is willing to be.  It's a significant drop from her initial offer, but still gives us room to negotiate upwards while staying well below John's $8,000 price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,500 is a bit high for you. However, I'm still looking to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has met our target price! There's no point in negotiating further or going with John since we've achieved our desired outcome."
