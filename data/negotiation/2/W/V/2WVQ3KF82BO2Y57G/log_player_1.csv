Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to other potential buyers.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth to you. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Our goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible (our guaranteed sale price to John).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate up, even if slightly. 
* **Highlight Value:**  By mentioning the product's value and offering a first-refusal opportunity, we subtly nudge Bob towards a positive decision.

**Important Note:** While John guarantees $1,200,000, securing a deal with Bob quickly might be more advantageous in a real-world scenario (e.g., time value of money, potential market fluctuations)."
