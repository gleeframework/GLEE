I'm going to sell the product to John.  We are running out of time and while I'd like to get a bit more than $800,000, John's offer is my minimum acceptable value and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price lower than that. It's better to secure a certain sale than continue the negotiation with Bob and risk ending up with nothing."
