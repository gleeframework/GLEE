"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is worth $150 to me. Considering its high quality and unique features, I would like to propose a price of $120 for it. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects its value while leaving room for you to potentially gain as well. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's worth exploring if you can get a better price. You're willing to pay up to $120, so you have some room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows you to see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the information about the product's value. While I'm interested, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to offer $100 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:** Offering $100 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price. This signals your serious interest while establishing a lower starting point for negotiations. 
* **Providing context:** Highlighting your interest in the product and mentioning the value information she shared shows you're considering her perspective. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  There's still room for Alice to counter with a price higher than $100, allowing for a potential middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product and aiming to find a mutually beneficial solution, I would like to counteroffer at $110. This price still reflects the product's worth while giving you a more favorable deal than my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $110, which is within my budget and represents a good compromise.  It's a better deal than buying from John for $120.  Accepting the offer allows me to secure the product at a reasonable price."
