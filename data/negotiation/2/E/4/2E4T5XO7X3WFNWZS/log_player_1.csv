"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as the product is worth $120 to Bob, and I'm hoping to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get more, Bob's offer of $130 is still a profit for me.  It's also a good sign that he's willing to negotiate."
