"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to pay $10,500 for the product. This price is fair for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. Let me know your thoughts.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm afraid $10,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12,500. I think this price is more in line with the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,500? This price is fair, and I believe it's a good compromise for both of us. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement on this.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not sure $11,500 is enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go a bit higher. I'm offering the product to you for $13,000. I think this price is a fair reflection of the product's value, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for you.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $13,000, so I'm offering the product to you for $12,750. This is the highest price I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",12750.0,Alice,7,
