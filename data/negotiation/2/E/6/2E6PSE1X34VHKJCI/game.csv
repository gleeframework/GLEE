"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $950,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $950,000 is closer, but still a bit high for me. Could we settle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I can meet you halfway between $950,000 and $900,000, so I'm willing to offer it to you for $925,000. This is my final compromise.",925000.0,Alice,5,
