"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget.  While $8,000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $10,500? This price reflects the product's value to you and allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's work together to reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $9,500? I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to go down to $10,000. This price is fair for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the deal. Let's finalize this, as I feel we're both at a good point.",10000.0,Alice,5,
