Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($800,000) as possible while ensuring Alice gets a price significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Negotiating Room:**  Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and Alice can slightly lower the price while still remaining well above her minimum.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** The message emphasizes the product's value and Bob's preferential treatment, potentially making him more inclined to accept. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Depending on how Bob responds, Alice can adjust her price slightly in subsequent negotiations. However, she should not go below a price that would make selling to John a better option."
