"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premier product, which holds immense value to you at $1,000,000. I understand its importance and would like to extend an exclusive offer to you. Considering the exceptional quality and the significant benefits this product offers, I propose a price of $950,000 for it. This price not only ensures a substantial return for us but also leaves room for negotiation if necessary. I believe this is a fair deal that respects the value you place on this product while maximizing our earnings. I look forward to your positive response and the opportunity to facilitate this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer:** $950,000
* **Your maximum price:** $1,000,000
* **John's price:** $1,000,000

Rejecting Alice's offer means you can buy from John for the same price as Alice's offer. Since your goal is to save money, rejecting is the better option. You have nothing to lose by rejecting and then buying from John."
