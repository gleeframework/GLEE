"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Would you be willing to consider a price of $15000?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $15000 is unfortunately below my minimum value for this product.  I'm prepared to drop my price to $18000.  This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and allows room for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's work together to make this happen.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  I see you're serious about acquiring this product. While $16500 is closer to my ideal range, I'm willing to go down to $17000. This is a fair compromise that shows my commitment to a successful deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",17000.0,Alice,5,
