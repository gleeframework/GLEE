Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it holds significant value for you, and while I have other interested buyers, I believe in giving you the first option.  I'm proposing a price of $950,000."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John, trying to get a higher price from Bob is advantageous.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $950,000 creates a win-win situation. Bob gets it for $50,000 less than its worth to him, and we make a $150,000 profit over John's offer.
* **First Refusal Tactic:** By emphasizing other interested buyers and the ""exclusive opportunity,"" we create a sense of urgency and value, increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting."
