{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but Alice is offering it for $900,000. This leaves significant room for negotiation.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially get a better price.
* **Time is on your side:** You have 10 rounds, so you have time to negotiate.

**Next Steps:** You will need to make a counteroffer in the next round.  Consider offering something closer to Alice's perceived value of $800,000, but still leaving yourself some room to negotiate."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meet Alice halfway:** Offering $850,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $900,000 but still leaves some room for her to make a profit.
* **Strategic bargaining:**  This counteroffer shows Alice that you're serious about getting a good deal and that you're willing to negotiate. 
* **Maintain leverage:** This counteroffer is still within your budget, giving you flexibility if Alice needs to counter further.

**Next Steps:**

* **Wait for Alice's response:** See if she accepts your offer or counters with a new price.
* **Be prepared to negotiate further:** If Alice rejects your offer, you'll need to adjust your counteroffer based on her response and the remaining rounds."

* **Meeting halfway:** This offer is a compromise between Alice's last offer of $1,050,000 and your previous offer of $950,000.
* **Balancing risk and reward:**  You are risking losing the deal completely, but if Alice accepts, you get the product for a price that's within your budget and not drastically above your desired price.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** With only one round remaining, the pressure is on. It's unlikely Alice will budge significantly more.
