"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $12,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This still gives you a good value, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but that's my final offer. Can you consider it?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your price.  While I'm not happy to go that low,  I'm willing to budge a bit more.  Let's split the difference - I'll accept $10,150. This is a fair price that considers both our positions, and I believe it's the best option for both of us.",10150.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,150 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,900, but that's my final offer. Can you consider it?",9900.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I respect that. However, $9,900 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time, but I need $10,025 for this to be worth it. This is a final compromise from my side. What do you say?",10025.0,Alice,7,
