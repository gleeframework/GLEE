"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $12,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit.
* **Friendly Tone:** Using a friendly and open tone can help build rapport and make Bob more willing to negotiate. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the product's value to make the price seem more justifiable.

**Reasoning:**

By starting with a high offer, I can maximize my potential profit. However, I'm also aware that Bob may reject it. I'm prepared to negotiate and make counteroffers to reach a mutually acceptable price. If necessary, I can always fall back on John's offer of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired profit margin. I believe there's room for further negotiation.

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** I can likely secure a better price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer.  
* **Time is on my side:** I have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's no rush to accept a low offer. 
* **John's Offer:** I have a backup option with John, giving me leverage in the negotiations.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our desired prices."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This still gives you a good value, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a ""good value"" for Bob.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** The price of $10,500 is the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's offer, suggesting fairness.

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding Common Ground:** By offering a compromise, I increase the likelihood of reaching a deal.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  While $10,500 is lower than my initial goal, it's still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer and allows me to make a profit.
* **Balancing Risk:** This counteroffer balances the risk of rejection with the potential for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but that's my final offer. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough to meet my minimum profit margin. I believe there is still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can secure a better price.

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a Higher Price:** I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price than $9,800. I have a backup option with John, which gives me leverage in the negotiations.
* **Time is on My Side:** With 6 rounds remaining, I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  I'm committed to earning as much money as possible for the product.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to reach a mutually acceptable price that is closer to my desired profit margin."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your price.  While I'm not happy to go that low,  I'm willing to budge a bit more.  Let's split the difference - I'll accept $10,150. This is a fair price that considers both our positions, and I believe it's the best option for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10150}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Emphasize Compromise:** I'm reiterating that I'm willing to compromise, making it clear that I'm taking his offer seriously.
* **Focus on Fairness:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a ""fair price"" that benefits both of us. This helps build rapport and make the offer more appealing.
* **Splitting the Difference:**  This technique suggests that I'm willing to meet halfway, creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to accept.

**Reasoning:**

* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** This counteroffer balances the risk of further negotiations with the potential for a successful deal.
* **Maximizing Profit:** $10,150 is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer, allowing me to make a profit.
* **Time Constraint:** While I have time on my side, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by being too stubborn.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to carefully consider my next move. I'll need to weigh the potential of further negotiation against the risk of losing the deal and having to sell to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I respect that. However, $9,900 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time, but I need $10,025 for this to be worth it. This is a final compromise from my side. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10025}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm framing this offer as a ""final compromise"", emphasizing my commitment to reaching a deal.
* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm again suggesting a midpoint between our previous offers, creating a sense of fairness and urgency.
* **Clear Expectations:** I'm outlining my minimum acceptable price, making it clear that I won't go any lower.

**Reasoning:**

* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** This counteroffer balances the risk of losing the deal with the potential for a good profit.
* **Maximizing Profit:** $10,025 is closer to my desired profit margin, and it's still a better deal than selling to John for $15,000.
* **Time Pressure:** With only 3 rounds left, the pressure is mounting to reach an agreement.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John. However, I'm hopeful that this final compromise will be enough to secure a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10,025 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,950, but that's my final offer. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,950. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,950
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,950 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Although I have only two rounds left, it's unlikely that Bob will increase his offer further.

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimizing Loss:**  I'm close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm also getting very close to the end of the negotiation.  There's a high risk that Bob will reject my next offer, leaving me with no deal at all. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $15,000, which is a significant sum.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  The risk of further negotiation is high, and the potential reward is not substantial enough to outweigh the risk of losing the deal completely.

**Next Steps:**

It's time to secure my profit and sell the product to John.  Although I would prefer to get closer to my ideal price, it's important to be realistic and choose the option that offers the highest probability of profit."
