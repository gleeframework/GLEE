Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):** There's no overlap between your minimum and Bob's maximum. This means getting Bob to buy requires creativity.

**The Strategy**

While a price agreement seems impossible,  you can incentivize Bob to buy by offering something extra that bridges the value gap. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I know this product is valuable to you, and I want to make sure you have the opportunity to own it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,450,000. To sweeten the deal and demonstrate my commitment, I'm also including [add a valuable bonus worth at least $250,000 to Bob -  think exclusive rights, long-term service agreement,  partnership opportunity related to the product].  This offer stands for 48 hours."", 
""product_price"": 1450000 
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Negotiable Price:**  Starting high allows you room to negotiate if Bob counters.
* **Value-Added Bonus:** This is KEY.  The bonus must be something that makes the deal worthwhile for Bob despite the high price. It needs to bridge the $250,000 gap or more.
* **Time Limit:** Creates urgency and encourages Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations**

* **Tailor the Bonus:** The success of this strategy hinges on identifying a bonus **highly** valuable to Bob. Research his business and needs thoroughly.
* **Be Prepared to Walk Away:** If Bob doesn't bite, you have John's guaranteed offer. Don't undervalue your product.
