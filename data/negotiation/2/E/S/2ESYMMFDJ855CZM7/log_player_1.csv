Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $150, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $140 is slightly below my minimum but significantly above Bob's perceived value. This creates a sense of a ""good deal"" for Bob while still potentially earning me a higher profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I can always slightly lower the price in a follow-up message.  However, starting high gives me the best chance to secure the highest possible price."
