Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it's a good value for my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,100,000? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my means.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  I'm still confident I can secure a price closer to $1,125,000. I'll try to counteroffer once more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your budget. I'm willing to budge a bit more, but I can't go lower than $1,110,000.  This is a final offer.  If we can't agree, I'll need to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1110000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to budge, but I'm still a bit short of my target. Would you be willing to consider $1,090,000? I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

At this point, Bob is not willing to meet my price expectations, and I'm running out of negotiation rounds.  It's better to sell to John for $1,000,000 than to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a worse deal."
