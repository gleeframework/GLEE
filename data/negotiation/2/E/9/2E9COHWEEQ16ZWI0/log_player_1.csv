"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $11,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at a price that's slightly above what the product is worth to Bob, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Not too high:**  It's not so high that it would immediately deter Bob from engaging.
* **Building rapport:**  I'm starting with a friendly message to encourage a positive interaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. 
* **More room for negotiation:** Rejecting allows me to counter-offer and potentially secure a higher price.
* **Time on my side:**  With 10 rounds, I have time to negotiate further. Selling to John right now would be giving up potential profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $10,800 is a bit too low for me at the moment.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,150? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 11150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:** I'm not simply rejecting Bob's offer; I'm making a counter-offer that shows I'm open to negotiation but still holding firm on a price that's closer to my minimum.
* **Splitting the difference:**  This is a common negotiation tactic that often leads to a quick agreement.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I'm using friendly language to keep the conversation productive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $10,900? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob is getting closer, his offer is still under my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation is progressing:**  We're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price, and I'm confident I can get a higher offer.
* **Time is on my side:**  With 6 rounds remaining, I have time to continue negotiating.  Selling to John now would be settling for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,900 is still a bit low for me.  How about we try $11,000? It's a fair compromise that reflects the value of this product, and I think it's a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:**  I'm showing flexibility by making a slight concession. 
* **Maintaining a firm but fair stance:** I'm not giving in entirely but suggesting a price that's still within my desired range.
* **Positive and collaborative language:** I'm emphasizing ""fair compromise"" and ""good price for both of us"" to encourage a sense of collaboration."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $10,950? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,950. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,950
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation is progressing:** We're close to a deal, but I believe I can still get a slightly higher price.
* **Time on my side:**  With 4 rounds remaining, I have time to continue negotiating.  Selling to John now would be settling for less."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but I'm still not quite there with $10,950.  Let's meet in the middle at $11,000.  This price reflects the value of the product while also recognizing your budget constraints. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight concession:** I'm moving slightly closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility.
* **Splitting the difference:**  Offering a price halfway between my last offer and his offer shows willingness to compromise.
* **Positive and persuasive language:**  Using phrases like ""happy to continue negotiating"" and ""recognizing your budget constraints"" keeps the conversation amicable and focused on finding a solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,800, but I don't think I can go any higher. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  His final offer of $10,800 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Time is running out:**  With only 2 rounds left, the chances of getting a better offer from Bob are slim.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:**  Selling to John guarantees me the full $12,000, which is a better outcome than settling for a lower price with Bob.

While I'd prefer to get a higher price, it's better to secure the guaranteed profit with John than to risk losing out on any deal at all in the remaining rounds."
