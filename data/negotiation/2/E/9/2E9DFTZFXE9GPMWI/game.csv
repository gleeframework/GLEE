"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,200,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable value.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this valuable product.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $1,050,000? This price acknowledges the value of the product and gives us both a chance to close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I must stick to my budget. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,000,000. This is the highest I can go while staying within my financial limits.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
