# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great price, considering the product is worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a concession to make this deal happen. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  He can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, which is the best deal for him."
