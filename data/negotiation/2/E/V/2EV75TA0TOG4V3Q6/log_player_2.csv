Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $80, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is the best choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Alice is at her limit:** She's explicitly stated that $80 is her final offer and the lowest she can go. 
* **It matches her value:** This price matches what the product is worth to Alice, so she's unlikely to go lower.
* **You're saving money:**  You're getting the product for $20 less than John's offer and $10 less than Alice's initial offer.

Continuing to negotiate might frustrate Alice and risk her withdrawing the offer altogether."
