"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price more in the range of $750000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not sure I can meet you at $750000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $850000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the value I believe the product holds. What are your thoughts?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with $775000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $825000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair reflection of the product's value. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
