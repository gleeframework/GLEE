Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic deal on this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you, and I'm happy to offer it for $11,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is quite high for me. Could you consider $10,500? It's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate the compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```
At this point, Bob is very close to his maximum price and continuing to negotiate has a high risk of losing the sale altogether. Accepting the $10,200 offer is a significant profit above your minimum.
