Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I think it's a fair compromise.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $700,000 is a serious commitment from you, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope you'll take it seriously. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is coming down in price, she's unlikely to reach my $800,000 limit.  She's made it clear that $900,000 is her bottom line.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed deal from John."
