"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, this product is worth a significant amount to me, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has a lot of potential, but the price point is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I think it's a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but that price is still a bit outside my budget.  I can do $700,000. This offer represents a serious commitment on my part and I hope you'll consider it.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is a serious commitment from you, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope you'll take it seriously.",900000.0,Alice,5,
