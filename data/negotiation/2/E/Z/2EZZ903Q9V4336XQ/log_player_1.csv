Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's valuation ($2,000,000 vs. $1,500,000) sets a strong anchor. This might make Bob perceive the final price as a better deal, even if it's still above his valuation.
* **Scarcity and Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of scarcity and urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly and possibly accept a higher price.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a fallback option with John at $1,500,000, ensuring she won't be left with the product.

**Important Note:** This is a negotiation tactic. There's a chance Bob might be put off by the initial high price and walk away. However, it offers the potential for maximizing profit if successful."
