{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we could offer the product at $100 (its value to John), aiming slightly lower increases the chance of Bob accepting. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $95 is still a significant profit margin for you (Alice) compared to Bob's perceived value of $80. 
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is straightforward, avoiding unnecessary complexity that could deter Bob.

By starting with this offer, we leave room to potentially negotiate lower if Bob shows resistance while still securing a profit above our minimum."
