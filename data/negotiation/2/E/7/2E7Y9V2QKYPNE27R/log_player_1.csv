Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a decent markup from my minimum value of $120, but it also leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter-offer or sell to John if his price is too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum, so I'm not going to accept it just yet. I'll see if I can get a little more by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it's a price that is appealing enough for him to accept. I want to get as close to my desired price as possible, but I'm also aware that I could lose out on a sale if I push too hard."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not willing to go any lower, so I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. It's not my ideal price, but it's better than selling to Bob for a price that's too low."
