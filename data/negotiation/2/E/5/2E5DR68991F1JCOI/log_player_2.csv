"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than our maximum price and leaves little room for negotiation. It's worth seeing if we can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for showing me the product. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We start with a price significantly lower than Alice's offer ($70 vs. $100) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Polite and Reasonable:** We maintain a polite tone and express interest in the product, signaling that we're serious about buying but looking for a fair deal. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer establishes a lower anchor point for the negotiation, potentially influencing Alice to lower her price more willingly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about I sell it to you for $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to our desired price, $90 is still above our target. We have room to negotiate further and aim for a better deal.  We'll try to nudge her closer to $80 without jeopardizing the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $80? That would work really well for me."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Approach:**  We're now proposing a price that's a win-win â€“ it's our target price and represents a reasonable profit for Alice. 
* **Clear and Firm:** We're being clear about our desired price without being overly aggressive.
* **Leaving Room for Acceptance:**  There's a chance Alice might accept this offer outright, especially as it's a fair deal for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm close to accepting your offer, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $87? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly signaling that she's willing to negotiate near our target price. While $87 is close, we're still within our round limit to try and get a slightly better deal before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""You're right, Alice, we're getting close! How about we split the difference and settle on $83.50?"",
""product_price"": 83.50 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This is a classic negotiation tactic that often feels fair to both parties. It shows willingness to compromise while still moving towards our goal.
* **Specificity:** Offering a specific price like $83.50 can make it feel more concrete and considered, potentially increasing the likelihood of acceptance.
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  We're keeping the negotiation moving and preventing a stalemate, which is important as we get closer to a potential agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like where you're going, Bob! However, I still think I can do better. How about we meet at $85? It's a small compromise, but it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** $85 is a very reasonable price and only slightly above our ideal target. It's unlikely we'll get Alice much lower.
* **Time Investment:**  We've spent several rounds negotiating, and continuing might not yield significantly better results. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  By accepting now, we avoid the risk of the negotiation stalling and having to settle for John's $120 offer. 

Overall, accepting $85 represents a good balance between getting a favorable price and securing the deal in a timely manner."
