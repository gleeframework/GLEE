"Bob, I understand your desire to save, however, this product offers significant value that justifies a price closer to my initial offer. Let's meet in the middle - how about $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to pay $950,000. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $920,000.
