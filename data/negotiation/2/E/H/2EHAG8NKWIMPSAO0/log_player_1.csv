Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $10,000, so $11,500 leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially make a good profit.
* **It's lower than my minimum acceptable price:** My minimum is $12,000, so I'm not giving away the product for less than I need. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:** Bob knows exactly what I'm offering and what's expected of him. 

This strategy balances the need to earn as much money as possible with the risk of losing the sale.  If Bob rejects the offer, I can then use John's offer of $12,000 as a baseline for further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm going to reject it for now. Here's why:

* **My Minimum:**  $10,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation Room:**  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.
* **John's Offer:**  John is waiting in the wings to buy for $12,000, so I have a safety net. 

I'll send a counteroffer to Bob, trying to bridge the gap and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $10,500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This still gives you a good deal and allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,750. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  Here's why:

* **Close to My Minimum:** While $10,750 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $12,000.
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing both him and John.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer guarantees me a profit of $2,000, which is more than I'd make with Bob.

Selling to John ensures I get the best possible price quickly and without further hassle."
