"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this incredible product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a tremendous asset to you.

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is simply not feasible for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and providing your perspective.  While I understand your position, $600,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  I believe this revised offer represents a fair compromise, reflecting both its value and my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving from your original position. To be frank, though,  $1,200,000 is still well outside my budget.  I can go up to $700,000 today, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know if that works for you.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints.  I've tried to find a middle ground here, but the value of this product to the right buyer is truly significant. I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,000,000. This is my absolute bottom line, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential returns you'll see.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
