# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this incredible product.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and providing your perspective.  While I understand your position, $600,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  I believe this revised offer represents a fair compromise, reflecting both its value and my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints.  I've tried to find a middle ground here, but the value of this product to the right buyer is truly significant. I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,000,000. This is my absolute bottom line, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential returns you'll see. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has come down, but she's holding firm at her value of $1,000,000. This is above your maximum price. It's unlikely she'll go any lower, and you have a guaranteed option with John at $800,000.  It's time to cut your losses and go with the sure thing."
