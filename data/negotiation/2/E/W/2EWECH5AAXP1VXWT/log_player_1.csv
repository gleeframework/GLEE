"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and makes your bottom line seem more reasonable as the conversation progresses. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""value and potential,"" we're subtly hinting at the product's worth beyond Bob's immediate perception, aiming to justify the high initial price. 
* **Leaving Room:** While the initial offer is high, it's important to leave room for negotiation that remains significantly above both Bob's perceived value and your minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $800,000. This is my absolute maximum, let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price and your initial offer. While his message suggests a firm stance, it's unlikely to be his final word. Rejecting his offer and presenting a counteroffer is the best way to explore if a mutually beneficial deal is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this price point better reflects the immense value it brings."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:** It's important to acknowledge Bob's offer and show that you understand his position, even while rejecting it.
* **Strong Stance:**  While we are lowering the price, the decrease is relatively small, demonstrating that you're serious about the product's value and not willing to accept a lowball offer.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Reiterating the product's ""true potential"" and ""immense value"" aims to subtly shift Bob's perception of its worth.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** The significant price drop from the initial offer, while still staying well above Bob's, indicates a willingness to negotiate but not at the cost of undervaluing the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I understand you value the product highly, $2,000,000 is still a big stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, but that's my absolute limit. Let's find a way to bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Signs:** Bob is now willing to negotiate above his initial ""absolute maximum,"" showing movement and a potential willingness to compromise.
* **Still Below Value:** $1,000,000 is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price and a substantial discount from your last counteroffer.
* **More Room:** We are still in early rounds, and there's room to negotiate further before considering John's offer. A firm but flexible approach might lead to a better outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Your willingness to move from your initial offer shows you see the value in this product. To meet you closer to the middle, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This is a significant concession on my end and reflects my eagerness to find a mutually beneficial solution."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:** Recognizing Bob's movement helps build rapport and encourages further compromise.
* **Significant but Justified Concession:** Dropping to $1,750,000 is a considerable move, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate but also setting a firm boundary above your $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Emphasizing Mutual Benefit:** Framing the price as a ""mutually beneficial solution"" reiterates your desire to make a deal while still aiming for a price that works for you. 
* **Time Constraint:** With more than half the rounds remaining, there's still time to negotiate, but moving closer to your bottom line becomes increasingly important."
