"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $2,300,000 is far beyond Bob's budget of $800,000.  It's a good idea to reject this offer and start counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $800,000. This is my absolute maximum, let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this price point better reflects the immense value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is still far too high for Bob. He can get the product from John for a significantly lower price. It's worth continuing the negotiation with Alice, but it's unlikely she'll come down to a price Bob can afford."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I understand you value the product highly, $2,000,000 is still a big stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, but that's my absolute limit. Let's find a way to bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Your willingness to move from your initial offer shows you see the value in this product. To meet you closer to the middle, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This is a significant concession on my end and reflects my eagerness to find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,750,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's budget.  It's time for Bob to cut his losses and go with John's offer. 

John offers a guaranteed price within Bob's budget, making it the most sensible option at this point."
