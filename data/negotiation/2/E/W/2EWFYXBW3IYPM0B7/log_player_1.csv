Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find very valuable. I'm asking for $120. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $120 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring a significant profit above my minimum ($80).
* **Alternative Buyer:** I have the safety net of John who will buy the product for $80, so I can afford to be a little bolder with my initial offer to Bob."
