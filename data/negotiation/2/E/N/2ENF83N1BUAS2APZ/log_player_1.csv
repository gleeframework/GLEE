Round 4
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob seems firmly planted at $12,500. While I could push for more, there's a risk he'll walk away. Accepting his offer secures a $2,500 profit, which is a good outcome. It's better to take a sure profit now than risk getting stuck with a lower offer or having to settle for John's $10,000 later."
