Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a good compromise between my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, but also leaves some profit margin for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for a price that's too low.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $10,250. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. $10,250 is a good price, considering that I'm already past the halfway point of my negotiation and I'm getting closer to my desired price. I'm confident that I can still make a good profit, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether by continuing to negotiate."
