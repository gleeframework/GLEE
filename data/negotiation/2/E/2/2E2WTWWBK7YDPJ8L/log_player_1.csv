""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. I believe this price accurately reflects its worth and future prospects."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth and the current market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still aiming for a higher price closer to my valuation. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is too low for me to accept outright."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the market, but the product's value remains high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? This price reflects both its inherent worth and our willingness to negotiate."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $1,500,000? This price is a good compromise, considering the product's value and our negotiation so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is now offering my minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee I can negotiate him higher, and waiting carries the risk of him lowering his offer. It's best to accept and secure the $1,500,000."
