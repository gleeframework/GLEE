"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it's worth $175 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

It's not worth it to buy from Alice at $175. You can get the same product from John for $150.  It makes sense to counter-offer Alice and see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $175 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $150 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
