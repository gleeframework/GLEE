{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's better to reject the offer and see if Alice will come down in price. You can always buy from John if the negotiation with Alice fails."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}

I'm starting with a lower offer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. This is a significant discount from her original price, but still above my maximum value for the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum value, so I will reject it and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing Alice that I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a price below my maximum value."

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum value, I'm still willing to try and negotiate a lower price. I have a few rounds left, and there's a chance she might be willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

I'm now offering Alice's minimum price, which is my maximum value for the product. If she rejects this, I'll be prepared to buy from John."
