"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product would be valuable for me, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit high.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $750,000? I think that's a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while working within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,4,
