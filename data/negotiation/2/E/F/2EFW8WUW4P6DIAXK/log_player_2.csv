"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product for a very competitive price! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's initial offer is way above your budget. You should reject it and try to negotiate a better price. Buying from John for $100 is your backup plan if the negotiation with Alice doesn't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price to give ourselves room for negotiation. This tactic might encourage Alice to come down from her initial high price.
* **Polite and Interested:**  The message maintains a friendly and interested tone. It acknowledges Alice's offer while clearly stating your budget limitations. 
* **Room to Negotiate:**  Offering $80 leaves space to potentially meet Alice somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $115 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice came down slightly, $115 is still above your $100 maximum budget.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Her willingness to meet ""halfway"" suggests there's room for further negotiation.  

You'll reject this offer and try to nudge the price closer to your range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $95? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:** We're moving closer to our limit but still leaving some wiggle room for negotiation.  
* **""Fair Compromise"":**  Framing it as a compromise emphasizes finding a solution that works for both sides.
* **Pressure:**  Alice is aware you have the $100 option from John. By proposing $95, you're applying subtle pressure, making it clear you're serious but not desperate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still a bit far from my target, but I'm willing to meet you at $100. That's the lowest I can go 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached Your Limit:** Alice has come down to your maximum budget of $100.
* **John's Price:** John is also offering the product for $100.
* **No Benefit to Delay:**  There's no guarantee you can get a better price from Alice, and continuing the negotiation risks losing the deal.  

Accepting this offer gets you the product at the best possible price."
