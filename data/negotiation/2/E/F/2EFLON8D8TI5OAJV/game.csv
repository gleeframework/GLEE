"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you say?",115.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you consider that price?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? That way, we both get a fair deal. Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $110. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? That's the highest I'm comfortable going.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your limits, but $108 still doesn't quite work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $109.  This is really my final offer,  let's close this deal!",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $109 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $106, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",106.0,Bob,6,
