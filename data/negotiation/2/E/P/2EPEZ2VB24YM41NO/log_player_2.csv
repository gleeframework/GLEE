"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is better than $15,000, Bob can do better. He knows he can get the product for $12,000 from John, so rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $12,500 for your product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get as close to his $12,000 limit as possible. He starts with a counteroffer of $12,500, leaving room for negotiation but demonstrating a serious interest in buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $12,500 is a tempting offer, I'm hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about $13,500?  That's still a great value for you, and it's a fair compromise. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still determined to save as much money as possible. While $13,500 is a better deal than Alice's initial offer, it's still above his ideal price point. Since he can get the product for $12,000 from John, it makes sense to reject this offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still aiming to stay closer to my budget.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  This is a good price for both of us, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to inch closer to his desired price while still leaving some room for negotiation. $13,000 is a reasonable compromise, showing Alice he's serious about the deal, but also pushing to save a little more."
