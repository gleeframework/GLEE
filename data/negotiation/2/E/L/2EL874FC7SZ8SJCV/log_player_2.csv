"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is significantly higher than that to me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. While I'm willing to negotiate, the product's value is substantial. Would you consider $1,250,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. It makes more sense to cut your losses and buy from John for the guaranteed $1,200,000 price."
