"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000? It's a fair price considering the current market.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is simply not a viable price for me.  It's far below what I need to get for this product. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $8,500?  It's a fair price, and it allows us both to make a decent deal. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Could you do $6,500?  That would work much better for me.",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to work with you. However, $6,500 is still quite a bit below what I need to get for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let me know what you think!",7500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $7,500 is getting closer, but I'm really trying to stay under $7,000.  How about we settle at $6,750? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",6750.0,Bob,6,
