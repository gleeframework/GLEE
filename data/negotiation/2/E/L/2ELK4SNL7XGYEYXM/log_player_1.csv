"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value. This sets a strong starting point and leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a win-win situation where I get a good price, and Bob gets a product he values."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is close to my minimum value, I believe I can get a better price. I'll reject this offer and counteroffer to see if I can reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $11,000, which is still higher than Bob's initial offer but closer to a potential agreement. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,200 is slightly above my minimum value and a good deal considering the limited rounds. It's a good outcome for both of us."
