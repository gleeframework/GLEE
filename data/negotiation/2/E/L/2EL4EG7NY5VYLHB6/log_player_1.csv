Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. Given my research, I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product. This reflects a fair price based on its market value. I'm confident this is a win-win proposition, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
