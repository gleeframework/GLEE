"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its incredible potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it will bring you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. Given my research, I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product. This reflects a fair price based on its market value. I'm confident this is a win-win proposition, and I hope you'll consider it.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This offer takes into account its value and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still outside of my price range. I'm confident that $800,000 is a fair offer, reflecting the product's value and allowing both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. This offer is final, and I'm willing to close the deal at this price.",800000.0,Bob,4,
