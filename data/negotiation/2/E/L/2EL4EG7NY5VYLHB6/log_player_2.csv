Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. Given my research, I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product. This reflects a fair price based on its market value. I'm confident this is a win-win proposition, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This offer takes into account its value and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

$1,000,000 is still too high. It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still outside of my price range. I'm confident that $800,000 is a fair offer, reflecting the product's value and allowing both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. This offer is final, and I'm willing to close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 800000}
