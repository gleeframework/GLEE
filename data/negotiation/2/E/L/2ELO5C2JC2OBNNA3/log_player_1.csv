{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts high, but leaves room for negotiation. It also highlights the value of the product to Bob, potentially encouraging him to accept.  I'm also keeping in mind that John is willing to pay $8,000, so I won't go below that price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. Please let me know if this is possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is better than $8,000, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price of $12,000. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $10,000 is a good starting point, but I'm still looking for a bit more. How about $11,000? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I am comfortable offering $10,500 for it. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's final offer of $10,500 is very close to my target of $12,000 and significantly better than selling to John for $8,000. It's time to close the deal."
