"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,000. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I need to stay within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, so I'll counter with $12,500. This price reflects the product's true value and gives us both a good deal.  Let's work together to find common ground.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,250. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",12250.0,Bob,4,
