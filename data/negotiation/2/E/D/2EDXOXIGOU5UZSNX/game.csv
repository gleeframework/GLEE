"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the market, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $900,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $875,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",875000.0,Alice,5,
