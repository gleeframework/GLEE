"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm hoping to get a better deal. Would you be willing to consider $10000 for the product? ",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can see you're a serious buyer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $11500? It's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $11000.  Let's see if we can find common ground there.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're making a serious effort to find common ground, Bob. I appreciate that. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay above $11000 to make it worth my while. How about we meet at $11500, but I'll throw in a bonus service that's worth $500? That way, you'll get an even better deal than my previous offer.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to add a bonus service, but I'm still not quite there on the price. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $11000.  I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and the bonus service you're offering.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're sticking to your guns, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I need to think about my bottom line. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. How about we meet at $11250? I'll throw in the bonus service as before, and we can call it a day.",11250.0,Alice,7,
