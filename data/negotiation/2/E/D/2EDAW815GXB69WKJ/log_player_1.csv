Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is intriguing, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately out of my price range. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for it, considering my budget and its value to me.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I value a sale, $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter with a price closer to my value in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a good deal considering the value of the product.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is still a significant stretch for me.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000, which represents a compromise. I'm confident this price reflects the value we both see in the product. Would you be willing to consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not quite enough. I'll counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your interest, $900,000 remains below my minimum price.

Let me know if you're interested in moving forward."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm determined to make this deal work, but $950,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to offer $925,000, which is a fair compromise that demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring your product. Let's find common ground and seal this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer!  $925,000 is a good offer, but I need to be at least $940,000 to make this work.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to go a little higher, but $940,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's meet in the middle at $930,000. It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied. What do you say?
