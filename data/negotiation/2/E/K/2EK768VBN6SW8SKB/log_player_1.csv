Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $13,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's a bit higher than the product's worth to Bob, but not so high that it's likely to be immediately rejected. I'm hoping to get as close to my desired price of $12,000 as possible without risking losing the sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  While I would like to get as close to my desired price as possible, I'm not willing to settle for $1,000 less. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm counteroffering at $12,500. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum price. I hope this will be enough to entice him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,500 is closer to my desired price than Bob's previous offer, I'm still not willing to settle for less than my minimum.  I'll counteroffer again, hoping to reach a price we can both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm counteroffering at $12,000, my minimum price.  This is a final offer. If Bob rejects, I'll sell to John for $12,000 to avoid further negotiation."
