# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $10,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,500. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair compromise.

At this point, Alice has met your bottom line. There's no benefit to continuing negotiations or going with John, as they both offer the same price.  It's best to accept the deal with Alice now."
