"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000 for your product. This price reflects my assessment of its value and my budget constraints. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,200,000 to make this work.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,150,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let me know if you're interested.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. While $1,150,000 is closer to my desired price range, I still feel it's a bit high. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,125,000 for your product. This price respects the value of the product while staying within my budget constraints. I hope you find this proposal acceptable.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
