Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a good price, and I get a fair return on my investment.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so he's likely to consider this offer.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** It's below your minimum of $1,500,000, but it gives you room to negotiate.
* **It shows flexibility:** The message conveys a willingness to negotiate, which can encourage Bob to engage.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground where both parties feel like they're getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000 for your product. This price reflects my assessment of its value and my budget constraints. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'm aiming for. It's worth trying to push for a higher price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,200,000 to make this work.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,150,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. While $1,150,000 is closer to my desired price range, I still feel it's a bit high. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,125,000 for your product. This price respects the value of the product while staying within my budget constraints. I hope you find this proposal acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is very close to my last counteroffer of $1,150,000.  This is a good compromise and a decent price, considering the risk of further negotiation. Continuing to reject offers could lead to a stalemate or Bob walking away entirely.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a profit that's above his initial offer."
