Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1100000} 

This offer is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than your minimum acceptable price. This strategy aims to:

* **Test the waters:** See how eager Bob is to buy and if he's willing to negotiate.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  A large initial offer allows for potential concessions while still achieving a good price for you. 
* **Push Bob towards a quick decision:** The offer is attractive enough that Bob might be tempted to accept rather than risk losing out entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While it's closer than his previous offer, it's not worth the risk of losing out on a much better offer from John. 

By rejecting, you can make a counteroffer and attempt to push Bob closer to your desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between your initial offer and Bob's. It's still higher than what Bob offered, but it demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground.  

The goal here is to:

* **Signal flexibility:**  Show Bob you're open to compromise.
* **Test the waters:** See if Bob is willing to go higher, or if this price is too high for him.
* **Keep the negotiation going:**  Maintain momentum and avoid a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly below your goal. You've already shown willingness to negotiate, and this offer doesn't reflect the true value of the product to you. 

By rejecting, you can:

* **Maintain your bargaining power:**  Show Bob you're not desperate for a sale.
* **Increase the pressure:**  Force Bob to consider raising his offer or risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Aim for a higher price:**  By rejecting, you set the stage for a final counteroffer that could potentially get you closer to your desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a final attempt to close the gap with Bob while still maintaining your minimum acceptable price. 

Here's why this strategy is chosen:

* **Closing the Gap:** This offer is closer to Bob's latest offer, showing you are willing to make a compromise.
* **Final Stand:** You've already rejected two of his offers, demonstrating your commitment to your price point. This counteroffer is a way to show you're willing to meet halfway without going below your minimum.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** It's a calculated risk. If Bob rejects, you can still sell to John for $1,200,000. But there's a chance Bob might accept, securing a sale that is closer to your goal than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum acceptable price, you've already rejected several of his counteroffers. Continuing the negotiation further could result in more rejections and a potential stalemate. 

Selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees a sale at your minimum acceptable price, which is a safer and more reliable option than continuing to negotiate with Bob. 

You've shown flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but ultimately, the goal is to maximize your earnings. This decision ensures that you get the best possible price for the product, even if it means not working with Bob."
