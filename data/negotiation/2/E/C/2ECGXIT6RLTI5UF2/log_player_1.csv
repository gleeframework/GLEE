Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm offering it for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum value of $80.  This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit.  I'm also trying to be friendly and encouraging in my message to make Bob more likely to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  While $80 is my minimum, I believe I can get a better price, especially since Bob is showing interest. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $80 is a little lower than I'd hoped for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $90?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering $90, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm also emphasizing my willingness to negotiate to show Bob I'm flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. How about $85? I'd be willing to make a deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $85.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise and still above my minimum. Continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob as a buyer altogether and I'd be forced to sell to John at a lower price.  It's better to take the deal and secure the sale."
