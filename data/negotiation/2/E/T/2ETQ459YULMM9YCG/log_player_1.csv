Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $15,000. It's a fantastic deal on something I know you'll find valuable."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Starting High:** A higher initial offer allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  
* **Confidence:** Presenting the offer with confidence and highlighting the product's value can make Bob more receptive. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to potentially negotiate with Bob if he rejects the initial price."
