"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Would you be willing to consider a price of $80?",80.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $150 represents a fair price for its value, I understand your budget concerns.  Could you consider $120? I'm trying to find a middle ground here.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $120 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90?",90.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing a pattern here, and I appreciate your persistence, but I need you to be serious about this.  $110 is my final offer - it's a steal for this product, and frankly, I have another interested buyer.  Take it or leave it.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm not willing to go above $100. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. Would you be willing to meet me halfway and sell the product for $105?",105.0,Bob,6,
