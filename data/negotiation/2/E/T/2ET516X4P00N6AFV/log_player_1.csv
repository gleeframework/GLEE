Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. Can you consider this offer?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Although Bob's offer is substantial, it's still significantly below my initial ask and the product's true worth.  I'm willing to negotiate, but not at that steep a discount. I'll counter in the next round."
