Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with an offer that's favorable to you. This leaves room for potential concessions and counter-offers.
* **Above Bob's Value:**  The offered price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), but still allows for negotiation.
* **Below Your Guarantee:** The offer is less than your guaranteed sale price to John ($1,200,000), ensuring you make a profit regardless.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still providing an opportunity for Bob to engage in a potentially mutually beneficial negotiation."
