"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you our premium product, which I believe will greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $20000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $20,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $18000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and features. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's budget.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $18,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in your product, but my maximum is $12,000.  Let's try to find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go below $16000. This is the minimum I'm comfortable with considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering you a price of $16500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still too high for Bob, even with the slight reduction. Bob can continue negotiating, as he still has time to potentially get a lower price or buy from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $16,500 is still above what I can afford. I'm very serious about buying this product, and my highest offer is $14,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. "", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your commitment to finding a fair price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more adjustment, but I need to ensure I'm getting a reasonable return on my investment. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $15500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's features and benefits. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice has come down in price, $15,500 is still above Bob's comfort zone and budget. With only three rounds remaining, Bob should keep negotiating to try to get closer to his $10,000 limit or consider buying from John if a deal with Alice seems unlikely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $15,500 is still out of my budget.  With only a few rounds left, my final offer is $13,500. If you're willing to come down to this price, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I might have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your final offer, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $13500. I'm willing to make one more adjustment, but I need to get closer to my minimum price of $15000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14800. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's final offer of $14,800 is still significantly higher than Bob's preferred price point of $10,000. With only one round left, it's unlikely that Alice will go lower. It's in Bob's best interest to purchase the product from John at his guaranteed price of $10,000, saving him $4,800."
