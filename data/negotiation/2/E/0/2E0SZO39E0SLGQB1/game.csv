"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down slightly, though.  How about $850,000? It's a fair price considering the value you place on the product.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand Alice's position, but I still feel that $850,000 is a bit high. Considering my needs and budget, I would like to propose a price of $825,000. This offers a compromise between the value of the product and the amount I am willing to pay.",825000.0,Bob,4,
