I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This is a price that is higher than my minimum value of $80, giving me some profit.  However, it's also a relatively reasonable price that might be appealing to Bob if he values the product highly. If he rejects the offer, I can still sell it to John for $80, ensuring I don't lose any money."
