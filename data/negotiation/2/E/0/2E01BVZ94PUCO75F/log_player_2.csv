"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I think it would be very valuable to you. How about a starting price of $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is less than John's price, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice.  This means there's room for negotiation and Bob can likely get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $14,000, but I'm still hoping to get a better price.  How about $12,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  While $12,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,000, which is still a good deal for Bob. He's getting the product for $1,000 less than John's price and $1,000 more than Alice's ideal selling price.  This is a good compromise and likely the best deal Bob can get.  Continuing to negotiate risks Alice walking away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price."
