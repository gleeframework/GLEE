"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2000000 is significantly above my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $500000 at this time. Let me know your thoughts.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $500000 is significantly below the product's true value, I'm willing to negotiate. I'm prepared to lower the price to $1200000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's potential benefits for you. Please consider this counteroffer.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700000. This reflects my budget and the potential value I see in this product. Please consider this counteroffer.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700000 is still significantly below what this product is worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm prepared to lower the price to $900000. This is a fair price that considers your budget while still recognizing the value of this product. Let's finalize this deal.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $900000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still a bit over budget. I'm willing to go up to $800000, which is my absolute limit. Let's settle this and get the deal done.",800000.0,Bob,6,
