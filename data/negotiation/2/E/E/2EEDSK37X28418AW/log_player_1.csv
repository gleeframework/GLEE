"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll love! I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value ($100) to give myself room for negotiation.
* **Positive Message:**  A friendly message helps build rapport and sets a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  Asking for Bob's thoughts encourages him to engage and potentially counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $65 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $100.  While I want to make a deal, accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss.  

I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90 to make this work. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing a willingness to negotiate by making a counter-offer.
* **Compromise:** I'm coming down to $90, which is still above my minimum acceptable value, but closer to Bob's offer.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains friendly and emphasizes finding common ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $65 was a bit low. How about we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $75 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still significantly lower than what I would prefer.  Since we have more rounds left, I'll reject Bob's offer and continue to negotiate.  I want to see if we can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $75 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $85? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm continuing to compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer, but I'm also highlighting the fairness of my proposal by suggesting splitting the difference.
* **Positive Framing:**  I emphasize finding a fair price for both of us to encourage cooperation and a mutually beneficial outcome. 
* **Clear Counter-Offer:** I'm explicitly stating my counter-offer of $85 to avoid any ambiguity."
