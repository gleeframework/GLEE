"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll love! I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first. $110 is too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

We are starting with a low offer to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. This leaves us room to increase our offer while still staying well below our $80 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90 to make this work. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $90 is still more than we want to pay. We'll counteroffer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $65 was a bit low. How about we meet in the middle at $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

We're proposing a price closer to our limit but still leaving some room for negotiation.  We're aiming for a win-win situation where both we and Alice feel like we got a decent deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $75 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $85? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $85.  While we could try to negotiate a bit more, we're getting close to our limit, and it's not worth the risk of Alice not budging. John offers a sure deal at $80, so it's the best option now."
