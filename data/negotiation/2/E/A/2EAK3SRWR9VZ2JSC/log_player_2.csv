"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $120. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum value.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I'm looking to pay closer to $105.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob is trying to get as close to his maximum value of $120 as possible while still saving money. 
* **Fair Counteroffer:** $105 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her value.  This gives Alice room to compromise.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and  shows Bob is willing to negotiate but also sets a clear price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $105 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $110? That's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Price:** Alice's offer of $110 is within Bob's acceptable price range of $120.
* **Negotiation Progress:**  While Bob initially wanted a lower price, Alice has already moved from $115 to $110.  Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk is that Alice could reject future counteroffers.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  If Bob rejects the offer and continues to negotiate, he risks Alice walking away or running out of rounds. Buying from John would cost more.

**Conclusion:** Accepting the offer is the most logical choice at this point, as it allows Bob to secure the product within his budget and avoids the risk of losing the opportunity."
