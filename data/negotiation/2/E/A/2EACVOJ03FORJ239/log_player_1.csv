Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
