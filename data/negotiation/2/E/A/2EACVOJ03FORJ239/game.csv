"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair price that should be acceptable to both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product. This is a final offer, as it's my maximum budget. If this isn't acceptable, I'll unfortunately have to consider purchasing from another seller.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,000,000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1,075,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
