"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175.  I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's starting offer is too high. It's important to negotiate to try and get closer to your desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but it leaves room for further negotiation.  It also keeps the offer within a reasonable range, signaling that I'm serious about buying but looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $110 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $140? I'm confident you'll find this to be a great deal for a product worth $150 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming closer to a reasonable price, but it's still above what John is offering. There's room for further negotiation to see if you can get closer to $125-$130."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $140 is closer, but I was hoping to be closer to $125. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 125
}
```

This counteroffer shows Alice that I am still interested but am firm on my budget. It proposes a price that is a fair compromise between her valuation and my desired spending limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $125 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and $135 is a reasonable price for the product. While we could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and this price already saves us money compared to John's offer."
