Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** While I haven't explicitly stated why the product is worth $150, implying value can make Bob more receptive. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message is friendly and suggests I'm open to discussing the price.

By starting at $150, I have room to negotiate down to my minimum of $100 if needed, while still aiming for a higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $120 is closer to my minimum, but I still have some negotiating room. By rejecting his offer, I signal that I believe the product is worth more. I'm willing to risk continuing the negotiation to see if I can get a price closer to my initial ask."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. While I'm motivated to sell, $120 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $135?"",
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I've come down from my initial price, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate. The new price is roughly halfway between our previous offers.
* **Maintaining Value:** I haven't dropped my price too drastically, reinforcing the idea that the product has significant value.  
* **Encouraging a Counter:** By suggesting a specific price, I'm encouraging Bob to counteroffer again, hopefully moving closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $120 was a bit low, but I'm still not comfortable with $135. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has come up to $130, which is a $30 profit for me. While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob will walk away. Accepting this offer guarantees a good profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
