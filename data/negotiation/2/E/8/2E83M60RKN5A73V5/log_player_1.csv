Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer starts with a friendly opening and sets a price that's above your minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  It's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is at your minimum, you can likely get more. By rejecting his offer, you can try to push for a price closer to your ideal $115."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? This still gives you a great price, and I'd be happy to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 107.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still hoping to stay within my budget. Could we possibly meet at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $105 is only $5 less than your desired price of $110, and it's still significantly higher than what John is offering. Accepting this offer ensures a profitable sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
