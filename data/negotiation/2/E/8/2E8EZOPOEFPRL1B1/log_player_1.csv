Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000} 

This is a good starting point as it's significantly more than your minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to remember that you're aiming to maximize your profit while also keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is more than selling to John, it's still significantly less than what you'd like to get.  Rejecting and counteroffering keeps the negotiation alive and gives you a chance to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise between your initial offer and Bob's offer.  It signals your willingness to negotiate but still keeps the price above your minimum threshold."
