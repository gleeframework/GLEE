"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000.
* Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly less than your maximum.
* There's room for negotiation to potentially get a better price.

**Next Steps:**

You should make a counteroffer to Alice to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves a good amount of profit for Alice.
* This price is significantly less than what you'd pay John, so it's still a good deal for you. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation and shows you're serious about a lower price. It's a reasonable starting point, and you can adjust your subsequent offers based on Alice's response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is still a good deal for you, considering your maximum is $1,500,000.
* While you could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and ultimately buying from John for $1,500,000 is too high.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Alice's offer guarantees you the product at a significantly lower price than what John would offer."
