"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11500. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than John's price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. There are 9 rounds remaining, allowing for more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11250. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,250 is closer to Bob's ideal price point, it's still above his desired maximum of $12,000.  There are 7 rounds left, giving Bob room for further negotiation. He can try a slightly higher counter-offer to see if Alice will budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,250 is closer, but I'm still a bit over budget. I'm prepared to offer $11,000.  This is a fair price that would allow us both to complete the deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your desire to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $11250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stuck at $11,250 and seems unwilling to negotiate further. Bob has already made his highest counteroffer and Alice rejected it.  With only 5 rounds left, the chances of Alice coming down further are slim. It's better for Bob to secure the product at John's price of $12,000 than to risk a potential deal failure and have to search for a new seller."
