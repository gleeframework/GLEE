Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really find valuable. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price of $150 signals that there might be some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate. 
* **Don't Get Greedy:** While I want to maximize profit,  asking for an outrageously high amount (like $200) might discourage Bob from even considering the offer. $150 feels like a good balance to test the waters.

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, I'm prepared to negotiate down. I know I have a guaranteed $100 from John, so anything above that is a win!"
