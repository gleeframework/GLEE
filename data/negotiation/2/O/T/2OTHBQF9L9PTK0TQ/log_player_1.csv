I'm starting with a high price of $20,000. This is a good starting point because it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.  I'm also confident that the product is worth more than $15,000 to me, so I'm not willing to sell it for less than $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$10,000 is way too low for me. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $15,000. I will reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $17,500. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. I hope this will be acceptable to him, but I'm still holding firm on my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $14,000 is close to my minimum, I still believe the product is worth more and want to see if I can get a bit closer to my desired price. I'll make another counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $15,500. This is a small increase from Bob's last offer and gets me closer to my minimum. I hope this is enough to persuade him to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. It's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing a sale by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
