"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I would be willing to pay $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe the product's value to you is significantly higher than $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm glad we're making progress, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I'm making a fair profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer in this range, but I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm starting to think we're getting close to the product's true value to you, but I need to be realistic about the market. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $950,000, which is $1,000,000. I'm offering the product to you for $1,000,000, and I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
