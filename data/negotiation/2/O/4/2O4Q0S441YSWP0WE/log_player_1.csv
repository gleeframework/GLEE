Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe the product is worth more than $10,000. I want to see if I can get closer to my asking price.  I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for $9,000. I'll counter with a price closer to $10,000 to see if we can reach an agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm choosing to sell to John for $10,000.  Bob's offers are getting too low for me, and I don't think I can get a better price from him. John is a guaranteed sale at a price that's still acceptable to me."
