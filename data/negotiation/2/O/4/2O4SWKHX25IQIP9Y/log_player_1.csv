"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a great price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This initial offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground without immediately resorting to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to accept and avoid further negotiation, I'm confident I can get closer to my target price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my value for the product. I'm also emphasizing the fairness of the offer to see if I can appeal to his sense of reason."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $1,050,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,075,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, though it's getting closer. We're at a critical point in the negotiation. It's getting risky to keep rejecting, as we're running out of rounds. However,  I'm hoping that a strong counter-offer will persuade Bob to come up a bit more. I'm still confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to find common ground here.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,087,500,  but this is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider other options. "", ""product_price"": 1087500} 
```

I'm putting a lot of pressure on Bob with this counter-offer. I'm emphasizing the possibility of moving on to John, hoping to trigger a sense of urgency.  I'm also using the ""halfway"" approach, which can feel more fair to the other party. This could be the turning point in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $1,075,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,080,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tough call, but I'm going to accept Bob's offer. We're at round 6, and while I'd prefer a higher price, we're running out of rounds.  Accepting Bob's offer of $1,080,000 is still a decent outcome, and it avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely.  There's a chance I could get a slightly better offer in the next round, but it's not worth the risk."
