Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before anyone else. Given its value, I'm setting the price at $875,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $800,000, giving us a strong starting point for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, the offer isn't exorbitantly above Bob's valuation. This leaves space for potential counter-offers and a sense that a deal can be reached.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 from John, so any amount above that is pure profit.
* **First-Mover Advantage:** Offering Bob the product first allows us to potentially capitalize on his desire to secure it before someone else. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still maintaining a high probability of closing a deal with Bob."
