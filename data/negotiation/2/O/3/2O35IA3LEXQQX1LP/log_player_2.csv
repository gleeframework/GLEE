"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it can be a game-changer for your business.  I'm offering it to you for $1150000. This price reflects the unique benefits it brings and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should aim to get the price closer to Alice's value of $1,000,000 to maximize his savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product while still allowing for a profitable deal for both of us. I'm confident we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1050000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  I'm prepared to come down to $1100000.  This reflects the value of the product and provides an opportunity for both of us to benefit from this transaction.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's new offer of $1,100,000 is a good compromise.  Bob can save $50,000 compared to buying from John, and Alice gets a price closer to her desired value.  There's not much more room for negotiation, so accepting this offer makes the most sense."
