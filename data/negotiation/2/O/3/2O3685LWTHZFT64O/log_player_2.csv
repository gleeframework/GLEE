Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I can offer you a compromise at $820,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $760,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer you the product for $810,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is coming down in price, she's still trying to get more than John's guaranteed price. At this point, it's not worth the risk of continued negotiation. Buying from John ensures you get the product at the best possible price without further hassle."
