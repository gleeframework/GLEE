"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product is valuable, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I can offer you a compromise at $820,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think?",820000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. I could potentially meet you at $760,000.  This would be a good deal for me while still reflecting the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $760,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer you the product for $810,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think?",810000.0,Alice,5,
