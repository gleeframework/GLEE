"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $110 is still too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

This is a starting point for negotiation.  I'm aiming low to see how much wiggle room there is in the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $110 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$90 is still a bit high. Let's see if we can negotiate further down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $70? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

We're getting closer to a reasonable price. By offering $70, I'm aiming for a middle ground between her previous offer and my previous counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not willing to go as low as $70. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about we try $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We're getting close, but I know I can get it for $80 from John. One more counter offer should do the trick!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $80? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

This is my final offer. It's the maximum I'm willing to pay and gives Alice a chance to make a small profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is unlikely to go any lower. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for $80."
