"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but that price is a little too high for me. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a bit off.  Could you do $725,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",850000.0,Alice,5,
