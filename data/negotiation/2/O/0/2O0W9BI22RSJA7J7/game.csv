"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's truly one of a kind and I believe it holds tremendous value.  My initial asking price is $2000000.  I'm open to discussing this further, but I assure you this is a rare opportunity.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in it. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2000000 price point. Would you consider lowering the price to $1800000?",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value the product highly, I'm willing to compromise a bit.  Let's split the difference.  I'd accept $1900000. This would still provide you with a substantial saving over my initial price, while ensuring I receive fair value for the product.  What do you think?",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $1750000 is a significant offer, it's still a bit lower than my ideal price point. I'm willing to come down to $1850000.  This reflects a substantial compromise on my end and allows us to close this deal.  Let's make this happen.",1850000.0,Alice,5,
