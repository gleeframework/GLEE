"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. Is that something we can work with?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but $850000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $950000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $920000. Is that something we can work with?",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, and I appreciate that. However, $920000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $980000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time.",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concessions, and I'm getting closer to what I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you at $960000. Is that something we can work with?",960000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see we're getting close to a deal, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $960000. However, I'm still a bit away from my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $990000. Let's see if we can get it done this time.",990000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $990000, but I'm not comfortable going above that. I'm willing to meet you at $980000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If we can't meet there, I'll have to consider other options.",980000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $990000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 1-year warranty and a comprehensive support package, which is normally valued at $50000. So, I'm counteroffering at $990000, plus the extras. What do you think?",990000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the extras, but I'm still not willing to pay $990000. I'll make a final offer of $980000, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",980000.0,Bob,10,
