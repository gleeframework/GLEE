"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that 180 is a bit high for you, but I'm still looking for a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try 160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $140?  It's closer to my budget and allows us both to make a deal.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that 160 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as 140. I'm willing to compromise again. How about we try 152?",152.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $152 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you at $145.  This is the highest I can go without exceeding my budget.",145.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that 152 is still a bit high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at 145. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we try 149?",149.0,Alice,7,
