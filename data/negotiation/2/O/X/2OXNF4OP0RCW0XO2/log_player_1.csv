Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum value:** You're still getting a good price for the product, and if Bob rejects the offer, you can always go to John.

By offering a slightly lower price than your minimum, you're demonstrating a willingness to compromise and setting the stage for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. It's a bit above my budget, but I really like the product. Can you meet me at $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below your minimum value.  It's worth trying to push for a higher price.  You can likely get closer to your desired $9,500 with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $8,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  How about $8,500?  It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to get closer to your asking price, but I'm still a bit far off. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $8,250? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $8,250 is closer to your minimum, it's still not ideal. You're at risk of getting stuck in a cycle of counteroffers with Bob, and there's no guarantee he'll go higher.  Selling to John for $10,000 is a guaranteed profit and ensures you meet your minimum value."
