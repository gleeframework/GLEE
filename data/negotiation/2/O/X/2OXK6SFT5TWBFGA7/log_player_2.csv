"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality product at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We start with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This serves two purposes:

* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:**  A strong counteroffer helps us understand how much Alice is willing to negotiate. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Even if Alice rejects this offer, we have space to increase our bid gradually over subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but the offer is still above your maximum price and John's offer.  It's worth negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you moving closer to my price point, Alice. However, $11,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $9,000? I'm eager to make a deal."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We are moving closer to Alice's price, but staying below our $10,000 maximum. This keeps the pressure on Alice to negotiate while demonstrating our willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to make a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down significantly, but her lowest price is still higher than John's offer. You've made progress in the negotiation, but at this point, it makes more sense to take the guaranteed deal with John for $10,000."
