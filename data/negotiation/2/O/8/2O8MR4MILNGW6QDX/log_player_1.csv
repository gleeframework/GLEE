"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe in its potential and think you'll find this a fair starting point for negotiations."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,000,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Confident Tone:** The message aims to convey the product's value without being overly aggressive. I want to create a collaborative, rather than confrontational, negotiation atmosphere.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This initial offer gives me options. If Bob accepts, I significantly exceed my minimum. If he rejects, I can gradually decrease the price in subsequent rounds while aiming to stay above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is above his perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I have room to negotiate and eight rounds remaining. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired outcome by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. While your initial valuation doesn't fully reflect the product's true worth, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's consider $1,100,000 â€“ a price that acknowledges its value while still providing a significant return on your investment."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding, but Firm:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but standing firm on a price above my $1,000,000 minimum. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while emphasizing the product's value.
* **Meeting Halfway:** By suggesting $1,100,000 (the midpoint between our previous offers), I'm signaling flexibility and a desire to find common ground.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm subtly reframing the price in terms of Bob's potential gain, highlighting the ""return on investment"" to make the offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me and the price you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, but his latest offer of $950,000 is still below my absolute minimum of $1,000,000. It's unlikely he'll drastically change his valuation enough to reach my minimum in the remaining rounds.  

I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000. It makes more financial sense to take the guaranteed offer than risk Bob not reaching my minimum within the remaining rounds."
