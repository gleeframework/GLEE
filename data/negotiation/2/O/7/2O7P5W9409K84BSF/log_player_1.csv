"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a decent starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value. I'm curious to see how Bob reacts to this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's well below my minimum acceptable value of $100. While I could sell to John for $100, I'd prefer to see if I can get a better price from Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm going to counter with $120. This is still a significant profit for me, but it's a compromise from my initial offer. Hopefully, Bob will see that I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't go below my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below it. I'm not willing to sell for less than $100, and I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $110. This shows that I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'm also trying to get closer to my minimum acceptable value. Hopefully, Bob will see that I'm serious about reaching a deal and will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $100.  I'm not willing to sell for less than that, and I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer of $105. This is my absolute bottom line, and I'm confident that Bob will see the value in this deal. He's already offered $80, so this is only a small increase.  If he rejects this offer, I'll sell to John for $100, as I don't want to risk losing any more time on negotiations."
