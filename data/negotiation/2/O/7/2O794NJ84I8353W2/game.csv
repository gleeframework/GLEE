"I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $145.",145.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $145 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $160 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $160 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a lower offer of $140. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $140 is simply not enough for me. Let's compromise. I'm willing to go down to $155.  It's a fair price for both of us.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $155 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd like to make a lower offer of $142.50. I'm trying to get as close to the original price you mentioned as possible, but I really need to save some money.",142.5,Bob,6,
