"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me there?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $100 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $107.50? That way, we both get a good deal.",107.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit higher than $100. How about we meet in the middle at $105? That's the lowest I can go.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to come up a little bit.  How about $106? It's a small compromise on my part, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",106.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short. How about $104? That's as low as I can go.",104.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, but $104 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference one more time and go with $105? I'm really close to accepting, so let's see if we can find common ground.",105.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're close to accepting, but I really need to save some money. I'm willing to go up to $103, but that's as high as I can go. Please let me know if that works for you.",103.0,Bob,8,
