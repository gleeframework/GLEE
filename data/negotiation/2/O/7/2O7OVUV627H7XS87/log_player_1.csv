I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed minimum value of $800,000, but I believe there's a chance Bob might be willing to pay it, especially if he values the product higher. 

If he rejects, I can still sell it to John for $800,000. This strategy balances maximizing profit with ensuring a sale."
