"Bob, I understand your position, but $900000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the product's value and the potential it holds, I'm willing to come down to $1100000.  This is a fair compromise, and it gives you a significant discount while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
