"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I'm open to discussing this further and finding a solution that benefits us both."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves space for negotiation and counteroffers, demonstrating flexibility. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and a collaborative approach.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's willingness to pay:**  His response will reveal how close my initial offer is to his true valuation.
2. **Maintain a strong position:**  Starting high sets a favorable tone for the negotiation.

I'm prepared to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response in the subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is significantly above my minimum acceptable price ($800,000), it's still considerably lower than my initial ask and his stated value. I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a more mutually beneficial outcome. 

By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm seeking a higher price while demonstrating a willingness to continue the negotiation. I'm confident I can convince Bob to increase his offer closer to the product's value to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations.  However, the value this product brings to your specific needs is substantial.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your initial offer."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've lowered my price by $50,000, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's unique value to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits and justifying the higher price.
* **Holding Firm:** The new offer remains significantly above my minimum ($800,000) and closer to my initial ask, signaling that I'm seeking a price that reflects the product's worth.

By making this counteroffer:

1. **Encouraging a Counteroffer:** I'm prompting Bob to engage in the negotiation further and potentially increase his offer.
2. **Maintaining a Strong Position:** While I'm open to compromise, I'm not drastically reducing my price, demonstrating the product's value.

I'm prepared to assess Bob's response and adjust my approach in the next round while remaining mindful of my bottom line and the alternative offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation and our respective interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 represents a strong compromise and a significant profit for me. Here's why accepting makes the most sense:

* **Excellent Profit:**  $1,000,000 is well above my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and provides a healthy $200,000 profit.
* **Strong Negotiation:** Bob has consistently increased his offer throughout the negotiation, demonstrating his strong interest in the product.
* **Minimizing Risk:** Continuing to negotiate risks pushing Bob away or missing the opportunity to secure this excellent offer. While I might be able to get a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, there's also the chance Bob reduces his offer or stalls the negotiation.

Accepting this offer secures a significant gain while minimizing potential risks."
