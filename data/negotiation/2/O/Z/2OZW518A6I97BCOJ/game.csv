"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to make an initial offer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and leaves room for both of us to walk away happy.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a revised price of $875,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",875000.0,Alice,3,
