Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see you're still trying to get a good deal. I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $8,200. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for you.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $7,700, but I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $8,100. This is my final concession, and I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has signaled this is her final concession and is unlikely to go lower. Waiting further risks her sticking to this price or the negotiation breaking down entirely. Accepting at $8,100 secures a decent discount compared to John's $10,000 price."
