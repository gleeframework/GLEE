"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll get a great value out of it. I'm willing to start the conversation with an offer of $9,000 for the product.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $8,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, I'm still finding it a bit high.  Would you be open to $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're still trying to get a good deal. I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $8,200. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for you.",8200.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand you have a bottom line. I can do $7,700, but that's as high as I can go.",7700.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $7,700, but I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $8,100. This is my final concession, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",8100.0,Alice,7,
