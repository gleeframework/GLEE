"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $90 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm happy to meet you halfway though. How about $105?  Let's see if we can close the deal.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise further. How about $95? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm willing to drop my price a little more to $100. That's my absolute bottom line, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is your bottom line, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $98, but that's as high as I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",98.0,Bob,6,
