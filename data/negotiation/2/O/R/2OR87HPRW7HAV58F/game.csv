"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to meet in the middle, but I'm afraid I have to prioritize getting the best value for my product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. How about we meet at $1050000? It's a bit above your counteroffer, but I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can do better. How about we meet at $900000? It's a significant discount from your initial offer, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can agree on this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $950000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price.",950000.0,Alice,5,,

"Bob, I think we're getting a bit stuck in a loop here. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of a price that's just a bit higher than your latest offer. How about we meet at $980000? It's a small increase, but I'm confident it's a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can finalize the deal soon.",980000.0,Alice,9,,
