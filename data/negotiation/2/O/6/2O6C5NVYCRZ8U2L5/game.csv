"Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $800000 for it. This is my maximum offer.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. It's a great product and I'm confident it will bring a lot of value to you. Can you meet me in the middle?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still firm on my offer of $800000. I'm sure this product is valuable, but I'm limited by my budget. This is my final offer, let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm counteroffering at $1000000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but unfortunately, $1000000 is still a bit too high for me. While I'm determined to get this product, my budget restricts me to $850000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still looking to save a bit, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to make a small concession, so I'm counteroffering at $950000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, while your offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my limit. I understand you're determined to get a specific price, but I'm only willing to go up to $900000.  This is truly my final offer. If you're not able to accept this, I'll have to explore other options.",900000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to save as much as possible, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $975000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",975000.0,Alice,9,
