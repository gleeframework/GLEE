"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $100, knowing Bob values the product at $120. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Fairness appeal:** I'm using the phrase ""fair price"" to make the offer seem reasonable. 
* **Open ended question:** The question encourages Bob to engage in a conversation and makes him think about the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $100 seems a bit steep.  Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value for me:** $85 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe there's still room for Bob to increase his offer, as he clearly values the product at $120. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting his offer maintains my bargaining power and shows I'm not desperate to sell at his price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about $95? This would still be a great deal for you considering how much you value the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm making a counteroffer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but not at his current price.
* **Middle ground:**  $95 is a compromise between my initial offer and his counteroffer. It's still a good deal for him, but closer to my desired price.
* **Reinforcing value:** I'm reminding him of the product's value to him to justify my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Bob's offer of $90 is a good compromise, and very close to my desired price of $95.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  While I could try for $95, there's a chance he'll reject again, and I might end up selling to John for $80.
* **Time is a factor:** As we're in round 4, it's wise to accept a good offer before risking further negotiation."
