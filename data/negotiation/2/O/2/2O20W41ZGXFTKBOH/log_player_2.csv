"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $12,000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is still too high, and he can likely get a better price by counteroffering."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $11,000 is a step closer to his budget, he still has room to negotiate. There are more rounds to go, and Bob should aim for a price closer to $9,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $10,250. I'm serious about buying this product, and I believe this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still looking to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, but that's as low as I can go. This is a great product, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you at $10,000, which is a fair compromise for both of us. If you're serious about selling, I believe we can finalize a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $10,250, which is my absolute minimum. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to finalize the deal.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. At this point, Alice has come down to $10,250, which is very close to Bob's goal of saving as much money as possible.  While he could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk Alice will reject his counteroffer, and he might end up with no deal. Accepting the offer at $10,250 ensures he gets the product and saves a significant amount compared to John's price."
