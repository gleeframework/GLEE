Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing the price further if you have any questions or concerns."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, aiming higher initially allows room for negotiation. Bob might be willing to pay more than his perceived value, especially if he believes the product is scarce or highly sought after.
* **Justification:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's ""exclusive"" nature and ""unique value"" to justify the higher price without explicitly revealing your minimum.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""open to discussing the price further"" signals flexibility and encourages Bob to engage in a dialog. This could lead to a price closer to your desired outcome. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have some time before John's guaranteed offer expires. If time is a major constraint, a slightly lower initial offer might be more appropriate to secure a quicker sale."
