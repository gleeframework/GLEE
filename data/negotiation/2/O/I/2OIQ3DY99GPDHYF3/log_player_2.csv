"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. This is a great deal considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's a good deal for Alice, it's still above your target of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is possible:** You have 10 rounds, giving you room to negotiate a better price.
* **Buying from John is the worst option:** John's price is higher than your budget and Alice's initial offer.

By rejecting the offer, you can start the negotiation process and try to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value you place on it and my budget. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not unreasonable:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still above her minimum value.
* **Creates a negotiating point:** This sets the stage for a back-and-forth exchange that could lead to a mutually acceptable price.
* **Leaves room for concessions:** If necessary, you can increase your offer slightly in subsequent rounds to reach a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant price reduction and reflects my desire to work with you. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above your target:**  While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your desired $1,500,000.
* **Room for further negotiation:** You've made significant progress in two rounds, and it's likely Alice will be willing to lower her price further.
* **John is still too expensive:** Buying from John at $1,500,000 is still a worse option than continuing to negotiate with Alice.

By rejecting the offer, you can continue the negotiation process and aim for a price closer to your ideal budget."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go to $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate increase:** This counteroffer is a slight increase from your previous offer, demonstrating your willingness to compromise. 
* **Staying below your target:** It's still significantly lower than Alice's offer and within your budget. 
* **Setting the stage for a possible agreement:** This offer is likely closer to Alice's desired price point, making a deal more achievable in the next few rounds."
