"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet halfway at $10,500.  I'm confident this price still offers you a great value for the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $10,000. How about we meet at $9,800? I'm willing to pay a bit more than $10,000, but I need to stay within my budget.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you. $9,800 is still a bit low for me, but I'm open to finding common ground. How about we split the difference and agree on $10,150?  It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both.",10150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,150. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $9,900? I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.",9900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget. While $9,900 is tempting, I can't go any lower than $10,000. I'm confident that this price still offers you a significant value. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's the best way to ensure we both get a good deal. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,7,
