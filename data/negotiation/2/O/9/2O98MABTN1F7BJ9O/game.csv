"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,600,000 price point. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,600,000 represents the high end of its value,  $1,000,000 is a significant drop. Could we meet halfway at $1,300,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and deliver substantial value.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate your product, but I still feel that $1,300,000 is out of my budget range. Could we possibly agree on a price closer to $900,000? This would allow me to consider purchasing the product without exceeding my financial limits.",900000.0,Bob,4,
