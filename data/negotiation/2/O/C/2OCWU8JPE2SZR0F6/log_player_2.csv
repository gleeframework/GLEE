"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to us, but we're willing to negotiate. Let's aim for a fair price that reflects its value. How about we start at $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I'd like to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. I'm looking to save as much money as I can, and $150 is a bit steep for me. I'll offer $120, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay.
