"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a better price than John's $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested in the product, I'm only comfortable going up to $10,500 at this point. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer than Alice's initial offer, but still significantly higher than what the product is worth to Alice. This shows he's serious about buying but also willing to haggle. This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation while still offering a price that is better for Bob than buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I can't go below $11,000.  This product is worth a lot to me, and I believe it would be valuable to you as well. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,000, which is still better than buying from John for $12,000. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject the counteroffer and Bob will be forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a price that's within Bob's budget and saves him $1,000 compared to John."
