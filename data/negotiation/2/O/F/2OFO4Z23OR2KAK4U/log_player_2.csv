Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob, but I'm still not ready to accept $800000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900000. This is a compromise that I hope will meet your needs and show that I'm willing to work with you to find a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

```

While $900,000 is closer to my offer, I've already spent a few rounds trying to negotiate with Alice and it's looking like we might not be able to reach an agreement.  It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $800,000."
