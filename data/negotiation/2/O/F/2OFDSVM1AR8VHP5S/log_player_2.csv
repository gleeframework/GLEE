"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice. You can get the product for cheaper than $150 from John, so rejecting Alice's offer and trying to get a lower price is a good first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 
 
You're trying to get the price as close to Alice's value ($100) as possible, but still leaving room for her to make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
Alice's offer is at $115, which is still within your budget of $150 and closer to your desired price than John's offer. It's a good deal considering you can get the product for cheaper than John's price."
