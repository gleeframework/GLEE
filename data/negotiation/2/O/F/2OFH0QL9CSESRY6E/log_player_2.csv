Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This demonstrates my serious intent to purchase while also leaving room for negotiation. I believe $9,000 is a reasonable starting point, considering my maximum budget and Alice's potential profit margin."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

**Reasoning:**

I'm making my final counteroffer at my maximum budget of $10,000.  I'm confident that Alice will accept this offer. She's already lowered her price considerably, and I'm willing to pay her a fair price.  If she rejects this, I'll simply purchase the product from John at the same price."
