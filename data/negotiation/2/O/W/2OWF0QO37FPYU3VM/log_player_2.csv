"Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to buy the product for less than $120. Alice's offer of $180 is far too high. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  He's offering $100, which is significantly lower than Alice's asking price of $180. This is a bold move, but it sets the stage for a negotiation and hopefully gets the price closer to Bob's target of $120."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $160 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his maximum willingness to pay. Bob should continue to negotiate and aim for a lower price. He still has the option to buy from John for $120, so there's no immediate pressure to accept Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price. Offering $115 is a compromise, showing Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product, but still pushing for a better deal. This price is also a bit closer to John's offer, making it a more appealing option for Alice compared to losing the sale altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $155 is still above Bob's maximum willingness to pay of $120. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice might reject Bob's next counteroffer and further delay the purchase.  Buying from John guarantees Bob the product for his target price, so it's the most efficient and risk-free option at this point."
