Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's tempting to buy the product from Alice, it's not worth paying $50,000 more than his maximum budget. By rejecting, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price."

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $825,000 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's previous offer, it's still $25,000 over his maximum budget. He should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better price."
