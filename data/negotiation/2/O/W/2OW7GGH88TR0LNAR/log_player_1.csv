Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to part with it for $120."", 
""product_price"": 120
} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start the negotiation a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Not Too High:**  While we want to maximize profit, setting the price too high (like $200) might make Bob immediately reject the offer without counter-offering. $120 is a reasonable markup that Bob might still consider. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the ""great deal"" and how the product would be ""perfect"" for Bob, aiming to increase his perceived value of the product.

This strategy aims to achieve the best possible outcome:
* **Ideal Scenario:** Bob accepts the $120 offer, resulting in the highest profit.
* **Backup:** If Bob rejects the offer, you can always sell to John for your minimum acceptable price of $100."
