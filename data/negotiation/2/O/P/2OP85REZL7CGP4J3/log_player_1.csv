Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Reasoning:** I'm giving Bob a reason to consider my offer by highlighting the value to both of us. This can make him more receptive.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm not aiming for the full $1,200,000 right away. This allows for a back-and-forth, which can often lead to a better outcome. 
* **The Plan:** If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to counter-offer, but I'll keep John as a backup, which gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $950,000.  That's a fair price considering my maximum value for the product and leaves some room for both of us to walk away happy.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $950,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **John is a better option right now:**  John is willing to pay my minimum, so selling to him is a much better outcome. 
* **Negotiation potential:** While I could counter-offer, Bob's offer is so low that it suggests he might not be serious about negotiating.  It's unlikely I'll get close to my desired price with him.

**Next Steps:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to sell the product to John, securing the best possible price for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,050,000 to make this work.  This price reflects the value of the product to both of us and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Countering strategically:** I'm not rejecting Bob outright, but I'm also not accepting his low offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm setting a clear boundary.
* **Meeting halfway (almost):**  $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum and closer to Bob's offer, making it seem like a compromise.
* **Focus on value:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product to both of us, hoping to emphasize the fairness of my counter-offer. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While this offer is closer to my desired outcome, I'm still open to further discussion.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to weigh the potential of further negotiations with him against the guaranteed deal with John."
