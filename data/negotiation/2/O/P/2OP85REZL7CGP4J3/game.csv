"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $950,000.  That's a fair price considering my maximum value for the product and leaves some room for both of us to walk away happy.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,050,000 to make this work.
