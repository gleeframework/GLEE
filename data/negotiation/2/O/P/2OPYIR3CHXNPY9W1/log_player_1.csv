"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for maximum potential profit. If Bob rejects, we can negotiate downwards while still aiming for a significant profit. This strategy also gives me a better sense of the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counter with $18,000. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still leaving room for further negotiation. If Bob is truly interested in the product, this price might be appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $16,000. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,500 is getting very close to my desired price point.  It's higher than John's offer and only $500 less than my previous counteroffer. To avoid the risk of losing the deal entirely, I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
