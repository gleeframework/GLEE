{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob.  $120 is a decent offer, but I think I can get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $125?  Let's split the difference and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 125}

I'm still not quite satisfied with Bob's offer.  I'm going to see if I can push him a bit further in the next round.  I'd prefer to get closer to $125."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm open to compromise, but $122 still feels a little low to me. Let's meet in the middle at $123.50.  This way we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 123.50}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $123.  While I'd like to get a bit more, it's getting close to my preferred price and we're running out of time.  It's a good deal overall, and I don't want to risk losing out to John."
