Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will counter. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe there is room for further negotiation.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price, but still above my minimum, to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,750,000.  This is still well above my minimum and hopefully shows I'm willing to compromise while also leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is slightly above my minimum of $1,500,000 and is worth taking.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk Bob could walk away and I'd end up with John's offer, which is the same amount.  I'll accept this offer and close the deal."
