"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Could we perhaps negotiate a price closer to $950000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950000 is unfortunately below what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1075000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to ensure a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the need for a reasonable profit, I am still aiming to keep my expenses within my budget. Could we consider a price closer to $1025000? I believe this would be a fair compromise, allowing us to move forward with the transaction.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
