"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $9,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? It's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $8,250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $8,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close the deal at that price.",8000.0,Bob,4,
