"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I know has a significant value for your business. I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll gain from owning it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is significantly lower than the value this product brings to your business.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which reflects a compromise on my side.  I believe this price is still fair, considering the value it offers you. Let's find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I'll get from the product, and it's within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation, but $950,000 is still significantly below the value this product brings to your business. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a substantial compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value you'll gain from owning it. Let's reach an agreement in this round.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $975,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my budget. I'm offering $975,000 is a bit too high for me, so I'm going to go a bit lower. I'll offer $925,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price for the product.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $925,000 doesn't reflect the true value this product brings to your business.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000 one last time, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price. I believe this compromise demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal, and I hope you'll consider it.",950000.0,Alice,7,
