"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95. Let me know what you think.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $110 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $105. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100.  Let's close this deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 was still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $100. I'm willing to compromise again and offer you the product for $102.50. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",102.5,Alice,5,
