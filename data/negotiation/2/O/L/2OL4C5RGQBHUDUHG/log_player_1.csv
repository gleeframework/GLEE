Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while still exceeding your minimum selling price ($120).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $119 creates the perception of a bargain for Bob while still securing a profit for you. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120 provides leverage. You can confidently price higher than $100 knowing you have a backup option."
