{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  A higher starting price allows me to potentially gain a better deal while still remaining open to compromise.
* **Positive messaging:** I'm emphasizing the value for Bob to make him more inclined to consider the offer.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide whether it's worth accepting or continuing to negotiate.
* If the negotiation doesn't yield a satisfactory outcome, I can always fall back on selling to John for my minimum acceptable price of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While it's closer to my desired price, $9,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can get closer to my target by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 
* **Avoiding a quick sale:**  While selling to John guarantees $12,000, there's a chance I can secure a better deal with Bob if I'm willing to keep negotiating. 

**Next step:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and see your enthusiasm for the product. While $9,000 is a good starting point, I'm hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer of $9,500 is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise and reach an agreement.
* **Maintaining a firm position:** I'm still above Bob's perceived value of $8,000, which allows me to potentially secure a better price than his initial offer.
* **Positive and encouraging message:** I'm trying to build rapport with Bob and keep the negotiation moving forward by using positive language and highlighting the benefits of the deal for him. 

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a decent profit while keeping the negotiation efficient.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess his next offer and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $9,500. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make another counteroffer. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $9,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $9,200 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm not willing to sell for less than that, as I can guarantee $12,000 from John.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's not at a point where I'd accept it. I believe there's still room for further negotiation.
* **Opportunity to increase the price:**  By rejecting this offer, I can make another counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal with Bob.

**Next step:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my target of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,200 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,400, which is a fair price for both of us.  It's a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9400}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying firm but compromising:** I'm sticking to my principle of not going below $9,400, as I'm confident I can get that price. I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer, but not compromising on my minimum.
* **Highlighting the benefits for Bob:** I'm reiterating that $9,400 is a good deal for him, appealing to his sense of value.
* **Keeping the momentum going:**  I'm using positive language to keep the negotiation going and avoid a stalemate.

**Next steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've secured a reasonable price, exceeding my initial offer.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll need to evaluate his next offer and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $9,400 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,300. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a stalemate:**  The negotiation has reached a point where Bob's offers are getting progressively closer to my minimum, but still fall short. I'm not willing to go below $9,400, and it seems like Bob is unlikely to increase his offer significantly.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $12,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and aligns with my goal of earning as much money as possible.
* **Minimizing risk:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him rejecting my offer, forcing me to lower my price further or potentially ending up with no sale at all.  Selling to John eliminates this risk and ensures a guaranteed outcome.

**Next step:**

I will inform Bob that I've decided to sell the product to someone else and close the negotiation with him."
