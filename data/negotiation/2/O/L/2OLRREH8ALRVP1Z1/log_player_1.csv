This offer is a starting point. It allows for some negotiation while still leaving me a profit margin.  I'm also being upfront and transparent with Bob, which will hopefully lead to a smoother negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,050,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This reflects the value I see in it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiating, I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $1,000,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is unfortunately below my minimum asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,000,000? This price reflects the true value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
