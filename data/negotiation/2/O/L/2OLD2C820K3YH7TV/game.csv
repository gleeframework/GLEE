"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $950,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow me to make a profit while still giving you a good deal. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $950,000. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
