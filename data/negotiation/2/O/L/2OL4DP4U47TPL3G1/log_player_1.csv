Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate but doesn't undervalue the product for me.
* **It's lower than my minimum acceptable price:** This leaves room for me to lower the price if necessary without going below my minimum. 
* **It's a clear message:** It directly states the offer and provides a reason for Bob to accept. 

I'm also keeping in mind John's offer of $10,000, which gives me a safety net if negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, considering the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a price of $8,000 for it. This aligns more closely with what I am willing to pay based on its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired range."

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired range. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
