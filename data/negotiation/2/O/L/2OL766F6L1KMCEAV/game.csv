"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $95. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to give you a small discount, but I'm not willing to compromise on the value. How about $99?",99.0,Alice,7,,

,,Bob,9,RejectOffer,96.0
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $97.50. I'm going to have to be honest with you, I was thinking more along the lines of $80 when I started this conversation. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet on that price. Can you really meet me at $80?",80.0,Bob,10,,
