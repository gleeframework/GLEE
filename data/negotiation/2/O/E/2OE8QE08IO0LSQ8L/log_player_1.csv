"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth more than that to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to trigger his desire to buy.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm ending with a question, making it clear I'm open to discussion and a potential counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to my minimum acceptable price ($15,000) as possible. 
* **Manage Risk:** By starting high and being open to counteroffers, I can potentially secure a higher price without alienating Bob completely.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Having John as a backup buyer gives me a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I believe I can't afford $12,000 at this time. Would you consider selling it for $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While $10,000 is a significant improvement from his perceived value of $8,000, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's room for negotiation. Bob acknowledged the product's value, and I can likely get closer to my target with a counteroffer.
* **John is a Strong Backdrop:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me confidence to hold out for a better price.

**Strategy:**

* **Continue Negotiation:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to control the negotiation and potentially drive the price higher. 
* **Counteroffer with a Compromise:** My next offer will likely be in the middle ground, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a profitable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about $11,500? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a midpoint between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($10,000). This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still trying to get a price closer to my goal.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to Bob, hoping to make him more motivated to close the deal.
* **Open to Further Discussion:** I end with a question, encouraging Bob to respond and potentially leading to further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain Control:** By offering a counteroffer, I keep control of the negotiation process.
* **Incremental Progress:**  I'm aiming for incremental progress with each round, gradually bringing the price closer to my target.
* **Balance Risk and Reward:** This counteroffer balances the risk of losing Bob with the potential reward of earning a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. I'm still not able to meet the $11,500 price point. Could you consider $11,000? This would allow us to reach a fair agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Target:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Continues:**  Bob's willingness to negotiate and the small difference between our offers suggest that further negotiation is likely to yield a better price.
* **John Remains a Safety Net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me the leverage to hold out for a better deal with Bob.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps control of the negotiation in my hands.
* **Incremental Progress:**  I'll aim for a small counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get the price closer to my target without pushing Bob away.
* **Evaluate Risk:**  I'll need to carefully consider the risk of losing Bob versus the potential gain of a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $11,000 still isn't quite there for me.  I'm willing to go down to $11,250. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** My counteroffer is a slight decrease from my previous offer, showing flexibility. 
* **Midpoint Approach:** It's the midpoint between my previous offer ($11,500) and Bob's current offer ($11,000).
* **Reframing for Agreement:** I reframe the offer as a ""fair price"" that benefits both parties.
* **Maintain Leverage:** I still hold the leverage, as I can always sell to John for $15,000. 

**Strategy:**

* **Incremental Approach:** My strategy is to gradually decrease my offer, aiming for a small compromise in each round.
* **Maintain Dialogue:** I want to keep the conversation going and avoid a stalemate. 
* **Balance Risk and Reward:** This offer balances the risk of losing Bob with the potential for a higher price, bringing me closer to my target."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, could we agree on $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Target:** While Bob's offer is only $250 less than my previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Limited Room for Improvement:**  With only 4 rounds remaining, the potential for significant price increases with Bob is limited.
* **John's Offer Remains Attractive:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is still a much more appealing outcome than accepting Bob's offer.

**Strategy:**

* **Push for a Better Deal:** I'll counteroffer again, hoping to push Bob just a little closer to my desired price.
* **Consider Time:**  With limited rounds remaining, I need to weigh the risk of losing Bob against the potential for a higher price.
* **Evaluate John's Offer:**  The potential to sell to John for $15,000 is a strong backup option if negotiations with Bob fail."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $11,125. This is a fair compromise that shows my willingness to work with you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:**  I'm making a small concession,  showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my goal.
* **Midpoint Approach:**  This offer is the midpoint between my previous offer ($11,250) and Bob's offer ($11,000).
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  I'm highlighting the compromise and fairness of the offer to encourage acceptance.
* **Time Constraint:**  With only 3 rounds left, I need to find a balance between getting the best possible price and closing the deal.

**Strategy:**

* **Negotiate to the Finish:**  I'm still trying to squeeze out every last bit of value.
* **Evaluate Risk:**  While selling to John is tempting, I believe there's still a good chance of getting a better price with Bob.
* **Final Push:**  This might be my last chance to reach a deal with Bob before I need to consider John's offer."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your flexibility. Considering the negotiations, could we settle on $11,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Potential:** Bob's offer remains at $11,000, which is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Time is Running Out:** With only two rounds left, the chances of significantly increasing the price with Bob are slim.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit and a price that is much closer to my target. 

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Selling to John ensures the highest possible profit in this situation.
* **Minimize Risk:**  Continuing with Bob carries the risk of losing the deal completely with no guarantee of a better price.
* **Embrace the Backup:**  John's offer provides a safety net and ensures a positive outcome for my business."
