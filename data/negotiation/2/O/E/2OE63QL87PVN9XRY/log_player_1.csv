Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200, which is significantly higher than my minimum value of $150. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my desired selling price.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low, it's below my minimum value of $150. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm offering $175, which is still above my minimum value but closer to Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want a fair price. I hope this will encourage Bob to increase his offer further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $150 is now at my minimum value.  There's no incentive to keep negotiating as I'm unlikely to get a better price from Bob, and John is also offering $150.  It's best to accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale."
