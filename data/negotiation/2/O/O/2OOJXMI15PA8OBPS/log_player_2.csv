# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

""product_price"": 850000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than the asking price to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering $850,000 is still a reasonable markup from Alice's valuation of $800,000, giving her a potential profit while leaving me space to negotiate upwards if needed.
* **Alternative in Mind:**  I have John's offer of $1,500,000 as a backup, so I don't want to agree to anything too close to that price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $850,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This still reflects the significant value this product holds for you, and it gives us both room to close a deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** Alice came down $200,000, so meeting her halfway at $925,000 shows a willingness to compromise and move towards a deal.
* **Staying Within Budget:** This price keeps me well below my $1,500,000 maximum and John's offer.
* **Creating Urgency:**  By proposing a specific price rather than a range, I'm suggesting this is a serious offer and encouraging Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand your position. Let's try $975,000. It's a good compromise that allows us to both close this deal and leaves you with a valuable product. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has signaled this is her final offer. While I could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely she'll go much lower.
* **Significant Savings:** $975,000 is still a significant saving compared to John's offer of $1,500,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Trying to get a lower price by rejecting again risks her walking away entirely, forcing me to buy from John at a much higher price. 

Overall, accepting the $975,000 offer secures a good price and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
