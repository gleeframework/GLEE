"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $850,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This still reflects the significant value this product holds for you, and it gives us both room to close a deal.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? That's a fair deal for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand your position. Let's try $975,000. It's a good compromise that allows us to both close this deal and leaves you with a valuable product. This is my final offer.",975000.0,Alice,5,
