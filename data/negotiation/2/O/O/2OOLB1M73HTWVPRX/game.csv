"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $80 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $115? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $115 is still a little more than I'm looking to spend. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product.  It's a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think.",95.0,Bob,4,
