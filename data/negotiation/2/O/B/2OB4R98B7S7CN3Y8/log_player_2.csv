# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit out of my budget.  Considering the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $825,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle.

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your target of $800,000.  You can still potentially negotiate a better price, so rejecting her offer keeps the negotiation moving in your favor."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still not quite there on the price.  How about we meet at $850,000?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you at $860,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll see it's a great deal. Let's see if we can finalize the sale at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $860,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to your target price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting her offer keeps the pressure on her to lower her price further. You can likely get a better deal if you continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $860,000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable going. Let's split the difference and finalize this at $855,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product and allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  I'm confident we can finalize this sale and avoid any further back and forth."", ""product_price"": 855000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $855,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $858,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $858,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $858,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $858,000, which is very close to your target of $800,000.  While you can technically continue to negotiate, there's a good chance Alice will not lower her price further.  At this point, it's more beneficial to accept her offer and secure the product at a price that is within your budget and still saves you a significant amount of money compared to John's offer."
