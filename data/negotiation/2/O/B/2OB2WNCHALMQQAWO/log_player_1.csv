""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it at a competitive price."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to get at least $1,200,000.
* **John's Offer:**  You have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000.

**Strategy:**

The offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing the sale with Bob:

* **Pricing Above Bob's Valuation:** The price is set above Bob's perceived value, creating room for negotiation but still offering him potential gain.
* **Below Your Guaranteed Offer:**  The price is strategically below John's offer, making it more appealing to Bob while ensuring you exceed your minimum target if he accepts. 

**Outcome:**

* **If Bob Accepts:** You make a profit of $150,000 (above your minimum).
* **If Bob Rejects:** You sell to John at your minimum acceptable price, ensuring no loss."
