"Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer. That price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter. I understand your position, however, $800,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I'm confident this is a fair offer for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While I understand the value, $1,300,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. $950,000 is still a significant gap from what I have in mind. Let's settle at $1,150,000. This offer reflects my willingness to close the deal.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,025,000 is close, but I need to get a bit more to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and call it $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,7,
