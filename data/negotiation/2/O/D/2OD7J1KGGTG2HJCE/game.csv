"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and high demand, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. I believe it's a fair offer considering the numerous benefits it offers. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is still a good price considering the value you've described.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly below its true worth and what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This price reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $12,000. It's a fair price, and I believe it's the best option for both of us. Let's make a deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $12,000 simply doesn't reflect the value this product offers. I'm willing to make one final concession at $16,000. This is my absolute bottom line, and I believe it's a fair price considering the quality and benefits of the product.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,6,
