"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point as it allows room for negotiation while still being above my minimum acceptable value of $150. I'm hoping Bob will find the value of the product to be higher than $200, but I'm prepared to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $180 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 190}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $190. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. I believe this price is fair and may be acceptable to Bob, while still allowing me to earn a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $170
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $170. While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm prepared to counter with a price closer to his offer in the next round, hoping to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering at $175. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, but still above Bob's current offer.  I believe this price is fair, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting this offer and closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $165
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $165.  While it's only slightly above my minimum acceptable value, I'm concerned that if I continue negotiating, I risk losing the deal entirely.  It's better to secure a sale at this price than to risk ending up with nothing.  I'll accept his offer and move on."
