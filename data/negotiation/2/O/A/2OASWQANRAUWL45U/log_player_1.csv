"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm asking for $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good chunk of the potential profit. However, I'm leaving room for negotiation. I also want to establish a good rapport with Bob, so I'm not just stating the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is my minimum, Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm offering a lower price, but still staying above my minimum.  I'm also reiterating the value of the product to keep the pressure on Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm getting closer but $10,000 is still a bit much. Could we settle on $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my desired price point and is a lot better than John's offer of $8,000. I'm going to accept."
