"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me halfway?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your interest in the product. I'm happy to compromise, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? That's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, and I appreciate the compromise. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $10,250? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. Can you consider it?",10250.0,Bob,4,
