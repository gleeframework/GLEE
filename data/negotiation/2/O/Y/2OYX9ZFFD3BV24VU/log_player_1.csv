"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good starting point in the negotiation. This leaves room for bargaining while still exceeding my minimum value for the product."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,350,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility, but still above my minimum value. I believe this counteroffer is fair and leaves room for further negotiation."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still aiming for a higher price. While Bob's offer is close to my minimum value, I'll reject it and see if I can push him a little further.  The risk of losing the deal is increasing, but I'm willing to take that chance to see if I can secure a better price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm dropping my price slightly to $1,300,000.  I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still maintaining a price that is above my minimum.  We're getting closer to a potential agreement, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn."

Bob's offer of $1,275,000 is only slightly above my minimum value but with only 4 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
