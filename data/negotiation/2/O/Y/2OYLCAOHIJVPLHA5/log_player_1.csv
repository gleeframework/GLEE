Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a truly unique item with immense value, and I believe this price reflects that. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000:** This is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product. It sets a tone of potential mutually beneficial agreement.

**Strategy:**

By starting high, I aim to maximize my potential profit. I'm aware Bob has a lower perceived value, so I'm prepared to negotiate.  If Bob rejects the offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and potentially adjust my strategy. If he's unwilling to meet my price, I can always fall back on John, who is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is intriguing, but $1,200,000 is significantly over my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, which is still a good price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $850,000 is higher than his initial valuation, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000, making Bob's offer less appealing. 

**Strategy:**

I will counteroffer Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer or at least closer to my minimum acceptable price. I need to see how flexible Bob is and if he's willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately below my minimum price point.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which I believe is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,050,000:** This price is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still staying above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Message:** I reiterate my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement and express willingness to negotiate further.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer shows flexibility while still prioritizing my financial interests.  I aim to gauge Bob's willingness to meet halfway. If he accepts, I'll secure a decent profit. If he rejects, I can either make a final counteroffer or sell to John as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant jump from my previous offer.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, it's still not enough. I'm not willing to sacrifice $50,000 for the sake of a quick sale, especially when I have a guaranteed alternative with John.

**Strategy:**

It's better to walk away from this negotiation and sell to John. He's already willing to pay my minimum price, and further negotiation with Bob might lead to more back and forth, potentially wasting time and ending up with a lower price."
