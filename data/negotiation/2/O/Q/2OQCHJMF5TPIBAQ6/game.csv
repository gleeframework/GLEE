"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential for your business, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects a fair starting point for our discussion, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm afraid $2,250,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. It's clear we both see the value in this product. While $1,800,000 is a considerable investment on your part, I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial proposal. Would you be willing to consider $2,100,000? This represents a meaningful compromise from my end, and I believe it fairly reflects the product's worth.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to get closer to your initial price, Alice, but $2,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $1,950,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1950000.0,Bob,4,
