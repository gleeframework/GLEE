"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $9,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,000 is lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a fair price for both of us, given the value of the product. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I've considered your latest offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I'm still not able to meet at $10,500. I would like to propose $10,000 as a compromise. I hope this is within your range.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $10,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a bit more. How about $10,250?  It's a small difference, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let's get this deal done!",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for your patience and understanding. I truly appreciate it. I would like to propose $10,100 as a final offer. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. I hope you agree and we can move forward with the transaction.",10100.0,Bob,6,
