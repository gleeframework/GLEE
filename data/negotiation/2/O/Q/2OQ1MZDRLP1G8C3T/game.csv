"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I understand your position, $9,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial price.  How about $10,500?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. How about $9,750? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,750 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's try $10,125. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.  What do you say?",10125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to make a final offer of $9,500. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to walk away and consider buying the product from John for $8,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to make sure it's a good one for me.",9500.0,Bob,6,
