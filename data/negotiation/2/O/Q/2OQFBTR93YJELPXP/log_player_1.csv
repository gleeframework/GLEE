Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it presents significant value, but I'm happy to extend this exclusive offer to you before exploring other options."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, aiming slightly lower initially might secure a quicker sale and still yield a significant profit.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering a price well above Bob's perceived value ($8,000) would likely lead to immediate rejection. Starting closer to your minimum but still leaving room for negotiation is key.
* **Alternative Option:** By mentioning ""other options,"" you subtly remind Bob that you have a backup plan, creating a mild sense of urgency without being overly pushy."
