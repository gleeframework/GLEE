"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed and crafted to provide exceptional value. This product is not just an item; it's an experience tailored to enhance your lifestyle. Given its quality and craftsmanship, I believe it's worth more than $100. However, I'm willing to start our negotiation at $125. Would you be interested in discussing this further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. The product is already available from John for $150, so I'm not willing to pay $125. I'll try to find a better deal.
