"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! It's a unique opportunity to own a high-quality item that will bring significant value to your life. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth, and I believe it's a great starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's best to reject and start negotiating.  There are 10 rounds, so you have time to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. This is a fair price considering I'm ready to purchase today. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $11,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair price considering our negotiation so far. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above my budget of $10,000. While it's a step in the right direction, I still have room to negotiate.  I'll reject her offer and continue trying to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,000 is still slightly outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $10,500 for the product. This price is a significant compromise for me, and I believe it reflects the true value we both see in this opportunity. Let's close this deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you at the halfway mark again. I'm thinking of a price of $10,750. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a good opportunity for us to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,750 is still above my budget of $10,000. With only 5 rounds left, it's likely that the negotiation will continue to be slow, and I might not be able to get a price I'm comfortable with.  It's better to secure the product from John at my maximum budget of $10,000 to avoid further negotiation and potential losses."
