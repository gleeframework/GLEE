Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $10,000. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, I have a safety net.  Offering the product to Bob at $10,000 allows for a potential $2,000 profit. This strategy is based on the following:

* **Potential Value:**  While the product is worth $8,000 to Bob, he might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives it as highly valuable or difficult to obtain elsewhere.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting high leaves room for potential negotiation. If Bob counters, I can always lower the price, knowing my minimum acceptable price is $8,000.

It's important to note that this is a single-round negotiation. In a multi-round negotiation, I might start with a slightly lower price to gauge Bob's interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
