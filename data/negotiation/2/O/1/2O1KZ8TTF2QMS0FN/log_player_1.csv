Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob's perceived value is lower, starting with an offer closer to your minimum ($1,200,000) leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Creating Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even if it's just John) adds a time pressure that might make Bob act quicker.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer is negotiable. If Bob pushes back, you can always slightly lower the price, aiming for somewhere between $1,150,000 and $1,200,000. 

This strategy prioritizes maximizing your profit while acknowledging the information you have about Bob's valuation."
