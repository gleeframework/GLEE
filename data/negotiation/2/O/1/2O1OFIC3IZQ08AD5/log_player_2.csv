"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be interested in.  I'm asking $125 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is higher than our ideal. We have room to negotiate and see if we can get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim low but reasonable:** We start with an offer that's significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still within the realm of possibility, especially since it's her perceived value of the product.
* **Polite and direct:** The message is framed positively, expressing interest but also clearly stating our budget limitations. 
* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:** This counteroffer will give us an idea of how much Alice is willing to negotiate. If she accepts, great! If she counters, we'll know we need to meet somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're interested! While $100 is my absolute minimum, I'm not quite ready to let go of the product for that price.  Would you consider $110? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good compromise:** Alice has signaled that $100 is her absolute bottom line. While we could continue negotiating, $110 is a reasonable compromise â€“ a significant saving compared to John's $150 offer. 
* **Limited potential for further savings:**  It's unlikely Alice will move much further from her stated minimum.  Continuing the negotiation might only yield a few more dollars saved at the risk of losing the deal altogether. 
* **Time value:**  Securing the product now at a good price is preferable to potentially drawn-out negotiations for a marginally better deal."
