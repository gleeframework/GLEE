"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I feel like we're getting close to a deal. How about we split the difference between our last offers? Would $975,000 work for you?",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I like your thinking on the split-the-difference approach! However, I'm still a bit short on the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000, which is a bit above the midpoint, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
