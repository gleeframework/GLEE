Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. What do you think?,20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I do see the value in this product, $20000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18000 is still a bit high for me. I'm feeling $14000 is a fair price, considering the value I see in this product.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm thinking of a price of $16000. I'm getting close to my minimum, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $16000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit stretched. I'm confident we can find a win-win at $15000.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",15000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're close to your limit, but I'm still not willing to go below $16000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, though. I'll meet you halfway between $15000 and $16000. How about $15500?",15500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your persistence. While $15500 is very tempting, I'm still just a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13500. This is my absolute final offer, and I truly hope we can reach a deal.",13500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your final offer is $13500, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more adjustment, though. I'll meet you halfway between $13500 and $16000. How about $14750?",14750.0,Alice,9,
