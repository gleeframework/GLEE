"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $12,000.  It's too early to buy from John, as we haven't seen what Alice might be willing to do in subsequent rounds.  Rejecting the offer allows me to start the negotiation and see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I do see the value in this product, $20,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a reasonable range for me.  This shows that I'm serious about buying the product but also demonstrates that I'm not afraid to negotiate.  We'll see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $18000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my maximum budget of $12,000. It's too early to buy from John as there's still potential for further negotiation with Alice. I'll continue to counter-offer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm feeling $14,000 is a fair price, considering the value I see in this product.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating that I'm serious about buying the product.  I'm also emphasizing the value I see in the product to justify my offer.  This counteroffer aims to continue narrowing the gap between our desired prices."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm thinking of a price of $16000. I'm getting close to my minimum, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $16,000 is still above my maximum budget of $12,000. However, it's a significant improvement from her previous offers, indicating a willingness to compromise.  It's worth continuing the negotiation as there's still a chance we can reach a deal that benefits both of us.  Buying from John at this point would mean missing out on the potential for a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $16,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit stretched. I'm confident we can find a win-win at $15,000.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly again, showing that I'm committed to reaching a deal but still firm on my budget. I'm also trying to close the deal by emphasizing that $15,000 is a win-win situation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're close to your limit, but I'm still not willing to go below $16000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, though. I'll meet you halfway between $15000 and $16000. How about $15500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $15,500 is the closest we've gotten to a deal, it's still above my maximum budget of $12,000. It's also getting late in the negotiation, with only 3 rounds left. I'm still holding out hope that I can get her down to my price or a little higher. Buying from John would be a safe option, but I'd rather try to get a better deal if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your persistence. While $15,500 is very tempting, I'm still just a bit outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,500. This is my absolute final offer, and I truly hope we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm pushing my limit here, offering a price that's very close to my absolute maximum.  This shows Alice I'm serious about closing the deal and emphasizes that there's little room for further negotiation on my end.  With only two rounds remaining, I'm hoping that she sees the value in accepting my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your final offer is $13500, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more adjustment, though. I'll meet you halfway between $13500 and $16000. How about $14750? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're in the final round of negotiation with Alice. While her offer of $14,750 is getting closer to my budget, it's still higher than my desired price.  It's unlikely that I can get her down to my target price within a single round.  Therefore, it's more beneficial to secure the product from John at $12,000 to guarantee a purchase within my budget."
