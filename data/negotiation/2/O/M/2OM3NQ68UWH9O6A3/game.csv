"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $950000. I understand this is a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see the return on your investment.  If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $800000, so I'm not willing to go lower than my asking price. Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Alice,1,
