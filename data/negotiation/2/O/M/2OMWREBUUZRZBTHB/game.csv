"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of significant value to you. While I can't disclose specifics at this time, it's worth no less than $1500000 to me. I'm offering it to you for $2000000, a price that reflects its potential.  This is a one-time opportunity. If you decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer. Let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
