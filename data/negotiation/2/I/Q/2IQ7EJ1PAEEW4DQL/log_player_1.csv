"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $12,000 is still a bit low, but I want to see if he'll come up a bit more."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $12,000 is tempting, I'm looking for a bit closer to $13,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $12,500? "", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. If you're willing to throw in some extras, such as a free accessory or a warranty, I'd be willing to meet you at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still hoping to get closer to $13,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge a little more. While a free accessory or warranty might be tempting, I'd rather focus on getting a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for some extras. While I'm not able to include those at this time, I'm willing to come down to $12,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. If you're willing to give me a small discount for the back-and-forth, I'd be willing to meet you at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting close to the end of the rounds, and I'm not sure if Bob will come up any higher. I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting his offers, I might end up with nothing. Selling to John for $10,000 is still a good deal considering my minimum, and it's better than risking a complete stalemate with Bob."
