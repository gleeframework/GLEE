Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 (John), you start with a strong position. Offering it to Bob slightly below your guaranteed price creates room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes ""unique value"" and ""potential benefits"" to justify the high price, even though you don't explicitly reveal its worth to you.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By saying ""initially proposing"" and asking for Bob's thoughts, you signal flexibility and openness to negotiation if Bob pushes back.

This strategy aims to secure the best possible price from Bob, knowing you have a solid fallback option with John."
