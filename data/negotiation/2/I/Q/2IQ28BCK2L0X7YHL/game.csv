"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe is worth a significant amount. I'm asking for $1500000 for it. I understand this is a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll find this product to be incredibly valuable.  I'm willing to discuss the price further if you have any questions.  If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $1000000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
