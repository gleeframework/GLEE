"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this amazing product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $120 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $110. This is a good deal, but Bob can try to get it for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate and potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice!  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend. Would you be willing to go down to $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $120 to Bob, and Alice is now offering it for $105. This is a good deal, and accepting it would save Bob $15 compared to buying from John. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his offer again, or he might end up paying more than $105."
