Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $119 for it. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 
 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if Bob will pay even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting with a price slightly below your guaranteed offer ($119) maximizes the chance of Bob accepting while still securing a high profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this offer doesn't explicitly invite negotiation, it leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he's very interested but finds the price a tad high. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you don't have significant costs associated with delaying the sale. If time is a factor, you might lower the price to ensure a quicker sale to Bob.
* It also assumes you value maximizing profit above all else. If you value a quick and easy sale, a lower price might be more appealing."
