"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's starting offer is too high. There's plenty of room to negotiate down towards a price that's beneficial for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $11,000?"", ""product_price"": 11000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop:**  Starting with a significantly lower counter-offer shows Alice I'm serious about getting a better price.
* **Within My Range:** $11,000 leaves me room to negotiate upwards while staying well below my $15,000 maximum.
* **Respectful Tone:**  I want to keep the negotiation polite and collaborative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, $12,500 is still above the midpoint between our initial offers. There's room for further negotiation to reach a price closer to $11,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $12,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $11,500. Would that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm:** I'm sticking close to my previous offer to signal that I'm serious about this price point. 
* **Compromise:**  A slight increase to $11,500 shows Alice I'm willing to compromise for a deal.
* **Direct & Clear:** By stating my desired price range directly, I'm hoping to encourage a quicker agreement."
