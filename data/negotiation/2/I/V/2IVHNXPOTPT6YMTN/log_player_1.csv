{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now offered $1,225,000 twice. This indicates he might be firm on this price. While I could push for more, there's a risk he might walk away entirely. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit above my minimum ($800,000) and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
