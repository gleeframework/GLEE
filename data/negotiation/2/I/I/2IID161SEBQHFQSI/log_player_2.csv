"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's always worth trying to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80} 
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $80. This is a reasonable starting point, showing Alice I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
Alice has come down from $90 to $85, which is a good compromise. At this point, it's  worth accepting the offer as it is likely I won't get a better price from Alice.  It's also close to my counteroffer, and  I want to avoid going back and forth and potentially ending up paying more if she counteroffers again."
