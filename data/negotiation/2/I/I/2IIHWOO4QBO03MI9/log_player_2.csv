"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The offer is at your maximum budget.** There's no immediate reason to accept. 
* **You want to see if you can negotiate a lower price.**  There's a chance Alice is willing to sell for less than your maximum. 
* **The option to buy from John provides a safety net.** If negotiations fail, you have a guaranteed alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:**  A significant discount (20%) demonstrates your serious interest in buying but also signals your willingness to negotiate.
* **Room to negotiate:**  This leaves room for Alice to counter without you immediately reaching your limit. 
* **John's offer as a benchmark:** This counteroffer reflects your desire to get a better deal than John's offer, but it's still within a reasonable range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice has moved closer to your desired price.** Her counteroffer of $11,000 is a good compromise.
* **The risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to bargain might lead to a lower price, but it also risks Alice walking away or getting stuck at $12,000 with John.
* **Saving $1,000:**  Accepting this offer saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John.  This is a significant saving considering your limited budget."
