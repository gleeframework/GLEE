"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

$20,000 is far above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. $20,000 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $12,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is too low for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $16,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

While $16,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still a bit too high. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to try and get a better price."
