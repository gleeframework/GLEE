"I appreciate your understanding of the product's value, but $2,250,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,800,000, but I'd like to see if we can do better than that. Can you consider a price closer to $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $1,700,000 is a tempting offer, I believe this product holds even greater value.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your confidence in the product's value, but $2,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,900,000, but I'd like to see if we can do better than that. Can you consider a price closer to $1,850,000?",1850000.0,Bob,4,
