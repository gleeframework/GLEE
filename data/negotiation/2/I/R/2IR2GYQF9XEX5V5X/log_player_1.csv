Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your understanding of the product's value, but $2,250,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,800,000, but I'd like to see if we can do better than that. Can you consider a price closer to $1,700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While I could push for a higher price, Bob seems anchored at $1,800,000. Accepting this offer guarantees a significant profit above my minimum, and further haggling risks losing the deal entirely."
