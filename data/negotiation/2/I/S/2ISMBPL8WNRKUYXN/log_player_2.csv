"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I'm open to discussing this further and confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree your product has value, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $1,125,000."", ""product_price"": 1125000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it's important to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Respectful Tone:**  The message acknowledges the product's value while clearly stating the price is too high. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This offer sets a lower bound. Even if Alice rejects it, it gives you a better starting point for future rounds of negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest.  I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm confident the product is worth significantly more than your offer, I'm willing to come down to $1,875,000.  This reflects a willingness to negotiate while still acknowledging the true value of what I'm offering.

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's current offer ($1,875,000) and your previous offer ($1,125,000). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still moving towards your target.
* **Positive Language:**  The message maintains a positive and appreciative tone to encourage continued negotiation.
* **Deadline Pressure:** While not explicitly stated, every counteroffer puts a subtle pressure on Alice. She knows you have the option of John's offer for $1,500,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle at $1,625,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth while also working for you.

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing In:** Alice is getting closer to John's price, but there's still room to negotiate.  
* **Leverage:** You're now in a strong position. Alice is clearly motivated to sell, and you have a backup option at $1,500,000.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The potential savings from another counteroffer outweigh the risk of Alice walking away, as you can always go with John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me on this.  I'm ready to make a final offer of $1,450,000. This represents a significant investment for me, but I believe in the value of your product."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** By stating this is your final offer, you add a sense of urgency and importance.
* **Slight Concession:** This offer is slightly above John's price, signaling a willingness to compromise to secure the deal with Alice.
