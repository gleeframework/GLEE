"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering the value I see in the product, but I'm not willing to go above that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm aiming for a higher price than Bob's offer. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a significant amount more than what I'd get from John and the negotiations seem to be settling around this point."
