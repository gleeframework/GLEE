"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows for room for negotiation and incentivizes Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $110 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to accept an offer that's less than what I'm comfortable with. I'm going to counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $85 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $95 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $90.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not willing to sell for less than $100. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm hoping to get a better price by continuing the conversation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  My final offer is $97. If you accept, we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 97}
