"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you significant value. I'm willing to start with an offer of $9,000 for the product.",9000.0,Alice,1,,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,8500.0
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $8,500 for the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",8500.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $8,500 is still a little steep for me. How about $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,9000.0
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm thinking of a price of $8,250 for the product. Let's see if we can get to a mutually beneficial agreement.",8250.0,Alice,5,,

"Hi Alice, thanks for understanding. I'm willing to budge a little more. How about $7,800? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",7800.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,8500.0
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to budge, but I'm still not quite there with $7,800. I'm thinking of a price of $8,200 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to you.",8200.0,Alice,7,,
