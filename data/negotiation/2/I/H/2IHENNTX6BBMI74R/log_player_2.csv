Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm thinking of a price of $8,250 for the product. Let's see if we can get to a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to budge, but I'm still not quite there with $7,800. I'm thinking of a price of $8,200 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to you.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While I could try to push Alice further, her latest offer is her ""final offer,"" and it's getting close to my walk-away point. Accepting at $8,200 still saves me a significant amount compared to John's $12,000 price."
