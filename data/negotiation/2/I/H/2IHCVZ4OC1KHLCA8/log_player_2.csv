"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $950,000. I know it's a significant investment, but it holds tremendous potential for you.  This price is below what I'd be willing to accept from another buyer, but I believe it's fair considering its value to you. Please let me know your decision, as I've already received a strong offer from another party.
