"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $110. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $100, which is my absolute limit. If you're open to that, I'd love to purchase the product. If not, I'll have to go with another option.",100.0,Bob,4,
