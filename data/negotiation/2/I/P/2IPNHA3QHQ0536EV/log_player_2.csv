"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and your appreciation for it, I am offering this exceptional item to you at a special introductory price of $9,500. This is an opportunity to acquire a product that is worth $10,000 to you at a competitive rate. I look forward to hearing your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you create the opportunity for her to potentially come down in price, getting you a better deal. If she doesn't budge, you can always fall back on John's offer."
