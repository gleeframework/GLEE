Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm willing to make this a smooth transaction. How about a price of $925,000?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle. 
* **Ensure a Significant Gain over John's Offer:** The offer must be significantly higher than $800,000 to make it worthwhile to risk Bob's rejection.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between ambition and the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
