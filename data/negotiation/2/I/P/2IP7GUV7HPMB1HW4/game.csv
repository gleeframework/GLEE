"Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that reflects its value. I'm asking $950,000 for it. This gives you a substantial advantage, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $800,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This still gives you a significant saving and ensures we both benefit from this transaction. Let's meet in the middle.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not convinced that $875,000 is the best price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose $850,000 as a more reasonable price. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,4,
