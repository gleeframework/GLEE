# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premier product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and the impact it could have on your endeavors, I am offering it to you for $950,000. This is an exceptional opportunity to secure such a valuable asset at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still a significant amount of money. Since I have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, I want to see if I can get a better deal from Alice. I'll start by making a counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $950,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to secure this product for a price closer to $850,000.  I believe this is still a fair price considering the value it brings to me and the opportunity cost of dealing with another vendor.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. After careful consideration, I am proposing a revised price of $900,000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between the initial offer and the counteroffer you presented. I look forward to your feedback and hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both parties.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is a good compromise. It's still significantly lower than John's price of $1,000,000 and closer to my target price of $850,000.  It's worth accepting this offer and securing the product without risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal."
