Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, Alice subtly implies it might be worth more than Bob's estimated $12,000. 
* **Alternative:** Highlighting that John is ready to buy at $12,000 might push Bob to accept the $15,000, fearing he'll lose the opportunity. However, it also reveals Alice's fallback position and limits her negotiating power in the future.

This approach aims to maximize profit while still being reasonable enough for Bob to consider the offer."
