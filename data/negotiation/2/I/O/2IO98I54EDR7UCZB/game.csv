"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity. However,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $1,075,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,075,000 is closer, it's still slightly above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,025,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My counteroffer is $1,080,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
