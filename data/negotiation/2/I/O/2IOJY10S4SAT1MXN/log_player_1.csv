Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product! It's valued at $1,500,000, and I believe it would be a fantastic asset for your business.  To start our conversation, I'd like to propose a price of $1,750,000.  This reflects the product's value and allows for room for a fair negotiation.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1750000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1600000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $1,600,000 is close to my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm eager to make a deal, $1,600,000 doesn't quite meet my needs. To demonstrate my commitment to a fair agreement, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,650,000.  This price reflects the product's value and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's find common ground!  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1650000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1625000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value you've placed on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000

While I would have liked to get closer to my original asking price, $1,625,000 is a good deal and  I don't want to risk losing the sale."
