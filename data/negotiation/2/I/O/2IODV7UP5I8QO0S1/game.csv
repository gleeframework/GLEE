"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product and am willing to pay $9,000 for it.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $11,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value, and I think you'll find it's a good deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $11,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would allow me to purchase the product while still being within my budget. ",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you in the middle just yet. I can offer you a price of $11,250, which is still a compromise, but I believe it's closer to the value of the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",11250.0,Alice,5,
