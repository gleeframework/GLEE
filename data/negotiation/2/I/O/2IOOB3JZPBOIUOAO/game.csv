"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $775,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to you.",775000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $775,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $700,000 is a bit closer to your budget, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $725,000. This is my final offer, as I don't want to compromise on the product's value anymore.",725000.0,Alice,5,
