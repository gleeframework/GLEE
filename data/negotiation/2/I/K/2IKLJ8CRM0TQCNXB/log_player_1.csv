Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but below your minimum ($1,500,000) sets a strong anchor. This might make him view the final offer as more reasonable.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,300,000 leaves room for some negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. You could potentially go as low as $1,100,000 and still make a significant profit.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, so there's no risk of losing the sale entirely. This strong fallback position allows you to be firm in your negotiations with Bob. 

**Important Note:**  While you have a guaranteed sale with John, it's always beneficial to try and secure the highest possible price."
