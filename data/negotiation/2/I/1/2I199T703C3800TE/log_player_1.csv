"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to me and still leaves you with a healthy profit margin. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $650,000, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price, especially since I have 8 more rounds.  I want to see if he's willing to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While $650,000 is tempting, it's a bit too far off what I need to get for this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000.  That gives you a good price point, while also allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. However,  $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, I believe.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While he's coming up, we're still too far apart. I believe I can push him a little higher and get closer to my target price. I'm also aware that John is waiting in the wings, so I have a good backup option if things don't work out with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your continued interest.  However, $700,000 is still significantly below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to get at least $800,000 for this product. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and it's within your budget.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}
