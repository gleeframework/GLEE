"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it still leaves room for negotiation and potential profit. 

This initial offer is a strong starting point, as it shows I'm willing to negotiate while still securing a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price and even lower than my initial offer. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell at such a low price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counter-offering Bob with a price of $950,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows that I'm willing to be flexible while still aiming for a price that's closer to my value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still lower than what I ideally want, it's a significant improvement from his previous offer. We're now very close to my minimum acceptable price, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting this offer ensures I still make a good profit and avoid the risk of getting nothing if Bob decides to walk away or if I'm unable to reach a higher price in the remaining rounds."
