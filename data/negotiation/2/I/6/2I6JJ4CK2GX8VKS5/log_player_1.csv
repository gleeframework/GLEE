Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product could be very beneficial to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.  I think it's a fair price considering its value."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we don't want to start too low. There's room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the price (even if it's just perceived value) can make Bob more receptive.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  The $12,000 offer leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, and for Alice to potentially lower the price slightly while still staying above her minimum. 

It's important to note that Bob might reject this initial offer. However, it's a strong starting point that allows Alice to maximize her potential profit while still having the security of John's offer."
