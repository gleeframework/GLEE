"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  While $120 is lower than I'd like to go, I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum value.  Let's see if we can make this work!",140.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $130 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $135?  That way we both get a fair price.  What do you say?",135.0,Alice,5,
