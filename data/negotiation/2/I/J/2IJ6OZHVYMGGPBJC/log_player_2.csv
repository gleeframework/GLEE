"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's below your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than the product's worth to Alice ($800,000).
* **Negotiation potential:** There's room for negotiation. You can likely get a better price.
* **Avoiding immediate purchase:** Buying from John would cost you more. It's better to try and negotiate with Alice before resorting to that."

{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a good starting point, but I'm hoping to secure a deal that benefits both of us. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is tempting, the product's value remains closer to my initial price.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? I believe this represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above Alice's value:**  While closer to the middle, Alice's offer is still above the product's worth to her. 
* **More negotiation room:** There's still some room to negotiate and potentially get a lower price. 
* **Buying from John is too expensive:**  Purchasing from John would be more costly than potentially getting a better deal with Alice."
