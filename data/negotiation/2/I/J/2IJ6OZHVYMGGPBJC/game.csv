"Alice, your initial offer is a good starting point, but I'm hoping to secure a deal that benefits both of us. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in it and allows for a fair profit margin for you. I'm confident we can come to a mutually agreeable agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is tempting, the product's value remains closer to my initial price.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? I believe this represents a fair deal for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to increase my offer to $875,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and represents a fair price considering the product's value.  I'm confident we can finalize a deal at this price.",875000.0,Bob,4,
