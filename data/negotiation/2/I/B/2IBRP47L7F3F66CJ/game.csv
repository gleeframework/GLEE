"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm thinking something closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. To move this forward, I'm proposing a revised price of $1,900,000. This reflects the true worth of what's on offer.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're still quite far apart.  That price is not even close to what I'm willing to pay.  How about we try $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This offer reflects the value you're gaining while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, your price is coming down but we're still not in the same ballpark.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, but that's my absolute limit.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I want to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is the lowest I can go. This is my final offer, and it's a fantastic deal considering the value you're getting.",1500000.0,Alice,7,
