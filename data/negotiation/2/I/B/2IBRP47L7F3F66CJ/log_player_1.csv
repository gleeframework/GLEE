"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Beginning with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value  ($2,200,000 vs. $800,000) leaves room for negotiation while aiming towards a figure closer to my own valuation.
* **Confident Tone:**  Projecting confidence in the product's value can subtly influence Bob's perception.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""mutually beneficial agreement"" clearly signals that I am willing to negotiate.

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility while keeping the option of accepting John's offer open for a guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm thinking something closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is far below both my minimum ($1,500,000) and his own perceived value ($800,000). This indicates he has significant room to move and is likely employing a lowball tactic. Accepting now would mean a substantial loss. I am confident I can negotiate a much better deal over the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. To move this forward, I'm proposing a revised price of $1,900,000. This reflects the true worth of what's on offer."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob but Standing Firm:**  I want to maintain a positive negotiating environment but also make it clear that his initial offer was unrealistic.
* **Strategic Reduction:** While still above both his valuation and my minimum, the reduction from $2,200,000 to $1,900,000 is substantial enough to encourage Bob to engage further while demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I am subtly reminding Bob of the product's benefits to counter his low assessment. 

By continuing the negotiation, I'm aiming for a figure closer to my own valuation while remaining aware of my alternative option with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're still quite far apart.  That price is not even close to what I'm willing to pay.  How about we try $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob increased his offer, $700,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price. His comment about the price not being ""even close"" suggests he's willing to go higher. I'll continue negotiating strategically to see if I can get closer to my desired outcome. I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a potential alternative if the gap remains too wide."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This offer reflects the value you're gaining while acknowledging your budget considerations."", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Seeking Common Ground:** The message emphasizes finding a mutually agreeable solution, promoting a sense of collaboration.
* **Strategic Concession:** A reduction to $1,750,000 shows flexibility and encourages Bob to counter with a more substantial increase.
* **Value and Budget Balance:** By mentioning both the product's value and Bob's budget, I'm framing the offer as a win-win. 

I'm maintaining a firm stance on price while leaving room for further negotiation. I'll continue to assess Bob's responses to gauge his willingness to approach a figure closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your price is coming down but we're still not in the same ballpark.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, but that's my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now reached his own perceived value of the product. While this is a significant step up from his earlier offers, it's still significantly lower than my minimum. His statement about it being his ""absolute limit"" might be a negotiating tactic, but it also suggests he may not be willing to go much higher. 

I will use the next round to test his resolve with a final offer that's closer to my minimum acceptable price. If he rejects this, I will sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I want to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is the lowest I can go. This is my final offer, and it's a fantastic deal considering the value you're getting."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear that this is my best and final offer.  
* **Justification:** I'm stating my minimum acceptable price while reiterating the product's value to Bob. 
* **Decision Point:** This offer will allow Bob to make his final decision. If he rejects it, I will proceed to sell to John for my guaranteed price."
