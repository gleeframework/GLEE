"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $11,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a better price than John's $12,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating. He knows the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, so there's room for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start a counter-offer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'm only able to pay $10,500 at this time.  It's a fair price considering your own value for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $10,500.  Would you consider meeting in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $11,500 to $11,000, which is a good compromise.  Bob is still saving $1,000 compared to buying from John. At this point, continuing to negotiate might not lead to a significantly lower price, and there's a risk that Alice will walk away or make a counter-offer that's too high. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price without risking losing the deal."
