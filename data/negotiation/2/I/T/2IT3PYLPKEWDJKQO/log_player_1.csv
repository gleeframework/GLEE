Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. It's a good compromise and gives us both a chance to make this deal happen.  What do you say?
