"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $15,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make a deal!",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. It's a good compromise and gives us both a chance to make this deal happen.  What do you say?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $13,000, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000.  It's a fair price for both of us and lets us finally finalize this deal.",14000.0,Alice,5,
