Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're getting close to the price I'm willing to accept. However, I'm still not comfortable selling it for $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
