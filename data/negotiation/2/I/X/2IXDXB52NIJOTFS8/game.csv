"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $17,000 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $15,500?  That gives us both a little wiggle room.",15500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, Alice. I'm glad we're getting closer.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,750?",13750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but $13,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we compromise at $14,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",14500.0,Alice,5,
