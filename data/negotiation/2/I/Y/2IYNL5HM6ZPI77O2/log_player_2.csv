"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this valuable product.  Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $13,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible. However, $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? It's a fair price considering the value you'll gain from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is a good compromise. Bob can still save $1,000 compared to buying from John, and it's closer to his desired price point.  It's unlikely that Alice will go much lower, and continuing to negotiate risks running out of rounds and being forced to buy from John at a higher price."
