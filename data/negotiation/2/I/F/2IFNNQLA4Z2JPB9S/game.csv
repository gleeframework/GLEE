"That's a bit steep for me. While I'm interested in the product, I'm only willing to pay $8000. I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking more along the lines of $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, but $18000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm sticking with my offer of $8000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're not on the same page, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking $20000 is a more reasonable price for this product. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to make a profit, Alice, but $20000 is still above my budget. Let's try $12000. It's a good middle ground and a fair price for this product.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $12000, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $20000. I'll sell it to you for $16000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but $16000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $14000, but that's my final offer.  Let's see if we can agree on that.",14000.0,Bob,8,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $14000, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $17000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,9,
