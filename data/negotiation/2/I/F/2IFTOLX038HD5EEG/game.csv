,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160, which is still a fair price for the quality of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $160 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $140. Can you consider this revised offer?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $140 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $145, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal. If we don't agree on this offer, I will have to sell the product to someone else.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $145 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $142, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",142.0,Bob,6,
