"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $180.  It's in excellent condition and worth every penny.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is below my minimum price of $150, I'm not willing to sell to John yet.  There's still room for negotiation with Bob, and I can potentially get a higher price by counteroffering.  I want to explore if Bob is willing to come up on his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160, which is still a fair price for the quality of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $160 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $140. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is closer to my minimum price of $150, I'm still not willing to sell just yet.  I'm one round away from selling to John for $150, which is a safer option than risking getting a lower price from Bob. I want to see if Bob is willing to come up on his offer one last time before I commit to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $140 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $145, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal. If we don't agree on this offer, I will have to sell the product to someone else."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $145 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $142, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $142
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $142 is still below my minimum price of $150.  I've already spent several rounds trying to negotiate with Bob, and it's clear we are not going to reach an agreement. I'm now only two rounds away from selling to John for $150, which is a safer option and guarantees me a profit. It's time to cut my losses and move on to a sure thing."
