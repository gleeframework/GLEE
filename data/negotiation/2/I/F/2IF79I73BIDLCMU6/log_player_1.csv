"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $110 for it."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) but not too outrageous. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and highlighting the value of the product to Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully observe Bob's reaction and his counteroffer (if any) to adjust my strategy for the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  I am not willing to sell the product for less than $100.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is below my minimum, it's not significantly lower. This suggests there's potential for a middle ground.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum, hoping to find a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95?  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to my minimum ($100) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Fairness Emphasis:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a fair compromise, highlighting the value of the product. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm staying positive and respectful to keep the negotiation amicable.

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully consider Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly, keeping in mind the potential of selling to John for $100 if the negotiation doesn't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $95 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $90? I'm eager to get this product, but I'm sticking to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $90 meets my minimum price of $100.
* **Time is Running Out:** We are already in Round 4, and I don't want to risk losing the deal to John, who is offering a guaranteed $100. 
* **Potential for Future Deals:** Even though I'm accepting a lower price this time, I've established a relationship with Bob, and there might be opportunities to sell to him again at a better price in the future.

**Next Steps:**

I will thank Bob for the deal and look for potential future opportunities to work with him."
