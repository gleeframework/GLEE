Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer for Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $10,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $12,000 to Bob.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential $2,000 difference where both you and Bob can benefit.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, but offering a price too close to $12,000 increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. Aim for a price that gives you a significant profit while still being attractive to Bob.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm proposing a price of $11,500.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:**  It's friendly, highlights the product's value to Bob, and proposes the price confidently.
* **The Price:**  $11,500 gives you a $1,500 profit (significantly more than your $10,000 minimum) and leaves Bob with a $500 gain compared to his perceived value. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start a bit lower (e.g., $11,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **One-Shot Deal:** Remember, if Bob rejects this offer, you have a guaranteed $10,000 from John. Don't be afraid to walk away if Bob tries to push the price down too much."
