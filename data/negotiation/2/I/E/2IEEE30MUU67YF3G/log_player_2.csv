You have three options:

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's best to reject it and counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is too low for me.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150

While $150 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. John is offering the same product for $100, which is within my budget.  I'll go ahead and buy from John."
