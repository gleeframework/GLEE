"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $12,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting Alice's initial offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm still confident the product is worth more to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $11,500. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,500.  This is a good deal for Bob since it's significantly lower than John's price of $15,000. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer and he might end up paying $15,000 to John. Accepting Alice's offer at $11,500 is the most financially sensible choice at this point."
