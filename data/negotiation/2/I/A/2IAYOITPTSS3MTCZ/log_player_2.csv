"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $100.  You should reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $100. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still above your budget.  You can try to negotiate further and get the price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $140 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $120.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is closer to your desired price, it's still above your budget. Since you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $100, it's the most financially sensible choice. There's no guarantee Alice will accept any further counteroffers, and you risk losing the opportunity to get it from John."
