"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $18000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product but I can only offer $12000. Let's see if we can work something out.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $16000. This is a fair price, considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to get a better price for this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money. I'm now offering the product to you for $17000. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it seriously.",17000.0,Alice,5,
