"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  I understand the value of this product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to offer you $600,000. I believe that's a fair price that considers both the product's value and my own financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,500,000. I will counteroffer, hoping to get a better price or reach a compromise."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is far too low for me to consider.  While I'm open to negotiations, I need a price that reflects the product's true value. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $900,000 is closer, but I still need to see some more movement. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly less than what I need. I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to find a compromise that's more favorable to me."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $750,000 still falls short of the value I need to consider selling.
