"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at a minimum of $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to start negotiations with a price of $1,200,000.  This is a significant discount, reflecting the value I believe this product will bring to you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's starting offer is far too high. We have plenty of room to negotiate and should aim for a price much closer to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  I understand the value of this product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to offer you $600,000. I believe that's a fair price that considers both the product's value and my own financial constraints."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is far too low for me to consider.  While I'm open to negotiations, I need a price that reflects the product's true value. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice came down significantly, $900,000 is still a long way from John's price. We'll continue negotiating and see if we can meet closer to the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $900,000 is closer, but I still need to see some more movement. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $750,000 still falls short of the value I need to consider selling.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer the product for $850,000. This represents a substantial compromise on my end.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

We're getting very close to John's price.  It's worth one more counter-offer to see if we can secure the product for a slightly better price than John is offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, this is a really good product and I appreciate you working with me.  To get this deal done today, how about we settle at $825,000? It's a strong offer, and I'm ready to close if you are."",
""product_price"": 825000
