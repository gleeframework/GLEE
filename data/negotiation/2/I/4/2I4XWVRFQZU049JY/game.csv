"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at a minimum of $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to start negotiations with a price of $1,200,000.  This is a significant discount, reflecting the value I believe this product will bring to you.  Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  I understand the value of this product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to offer you $600,000. I believe that's a fair price that considers both the product's value and my own financial constraints.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is far too low for me to consider.  While I'm open to negotiations, I need a price that reflects the product's true value. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $900,000 is closer, but I still need to see some more movement. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $750,000 still falls short of the value I need to consider selling.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer the product for $850,000. This represents a substantial compromise on my end.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. ",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is a really good product and I appreciate you working with me.  To get this deal done today, how about we settle at $825,000? It's a strong offer, and I'm ready to close if you are.",825000.0,Bob,6,
