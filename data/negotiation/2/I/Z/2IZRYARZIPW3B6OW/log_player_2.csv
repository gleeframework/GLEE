"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to your company.  While I understand it's worth $800,000 to you, I'm offering it to you at a special price of $1,200,000. This price reflects the significant value it holds for me. I am confident you will find this a good deal, as it's significantly less than what I could get from another buyer.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I will reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $800,000 to me, and Alice is offering it for $1,200,000, which is too high. I will look for a better deal.
