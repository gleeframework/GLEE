"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the potential benefits it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a good starting point, Bob can likely get a better price. There's a significant gap between Alice's offer ($1,300,000) and Bob's maximum price ($1,500,000).  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if a deal can be reached at a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is a significant step down from its true value and my initial asking price.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better deal by making another counteroffer.  He should continue to aim for a price closer to $1,000,000."
