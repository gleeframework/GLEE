"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $230 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking of making an offer of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest.  While $230 was my initial asking price, I'm open to finding a price that works for both of us. However, $120 is significantly lower than what I had in mind.  Could you meet me somewhere in the middle, say around $190?",190.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $190 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I was thinking of making an offer of $160. It's still a bit higher than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",160.0,Bob,4,
