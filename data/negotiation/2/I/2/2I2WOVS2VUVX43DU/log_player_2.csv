"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm confident it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's fair to both of us.  Would you be interested in discussing a price of $1,550,000?  This allows me a small profit while still representing a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a small markup, he can get the product for $1,500,000 from John, saving him $50,000."
