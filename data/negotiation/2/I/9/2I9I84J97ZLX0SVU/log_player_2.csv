You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price, meaning you won't save any money. It's better to reject her offer and buy from John, as the price will be the same, but you get to practice negotiating with Alice in the future."
