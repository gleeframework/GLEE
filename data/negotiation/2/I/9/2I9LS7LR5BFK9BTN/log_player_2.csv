It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price. You have 10 rounds, so you have some room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $75. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price of $90, but it's still within my budget. I want to see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has come down to $85, which is a good price considering my limit is $150. It's worth accepting this offer and closing the deal."
