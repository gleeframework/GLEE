"Round 1

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $100 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really serious about buying this product, but I can only afford $85.  Let's see if we can close the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $95. It's the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  I'm still interested in the product, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $90.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $95 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another small concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $92.50. It's the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should buy the product from John. The negotiations with Alice have reached a point where it's unlikely she'll go lower than $92.50, which is still more than Bob's $80 limit. It's more efficient and cost-effective for him to buy from John."
