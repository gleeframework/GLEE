Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

Round 4

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm serious about buying this product but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Would you consider $812,500?  That's right in the middle of our last two offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $812,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While we could try to push for a higher price, Bob is consistently meeting in the middle and we are now above our minimum acceptable price. It's better to secure a deal at $812,500 than risk Bob walking away and only getting $800,000 from John."
