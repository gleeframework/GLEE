"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $999000.

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product,  $999000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in making a deal, but I can only offer $700000 at this time. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700000 is a significant amount, but I'm still looking to get as close to the value of the product as possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $850000. This is a fair compromise that I believe will satisfy both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850000 is still slightly above my budget. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800000, which is the absolute maximum I can pay at this time.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go below $900000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept for the product, considering its value and the market demand. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer a compromise at $875000. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,
