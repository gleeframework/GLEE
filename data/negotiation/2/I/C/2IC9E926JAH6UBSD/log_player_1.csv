Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I believe you'll find quite valuable. Given its unique benefits, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 provides a safety net. Alice doesn't have to desperately lowball the price. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing value to Bob, rather than focusing solely on the price."
