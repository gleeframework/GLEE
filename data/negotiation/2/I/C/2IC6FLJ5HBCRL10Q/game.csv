"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of what it can do for you.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is simply out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for this product.  It's a fair price considering its potential.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,300,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm confident it can bring you a substantial return on your investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000?",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe in this product's value, and I do too. But $1,650,000 is still beyond what I can comfortably pay.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,450,000. It's a fair compromise that recognizes the potential of this product while staying within my budget. What do you think?",1450000.0,Bob,4,
