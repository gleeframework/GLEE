,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $150.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know what you think.",150.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $80 simply isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to compromise again and offer the product for $130.  This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price.  Let's close this deal.",130.0,Alice,5,
