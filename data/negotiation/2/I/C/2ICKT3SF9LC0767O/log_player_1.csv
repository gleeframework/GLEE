"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $180 is way out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $80 is better than nothing, it's still far below what the product is worth to me. I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $150.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $150 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $80. If that's not acceptable, I'm going to have to look at other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm starting to feel the pressure of time and the potential sale to John, I still believe I can get a better price from Bob. I'll try to find a middle ground in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $80 simply isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to compromise again and offer the product for $130.  This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down, but $130 is still more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm sticking with my offer of $80.  If that's not acceptable, I'm going to have to look at other options.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. I've made several concessions, and it's clear that Bob is not willing to pay a price that's fair to me. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob if I could get a better price, I'm not going to risk losing out on the sale to John. It's better to take the guaranteed $120 than continue to negotiate with Bob and risk ending up with nothing."
