I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters, and hopefully, it demonstrates the value I place on the product. I'm also keeping in mind that I can always go to John for the guaranteed $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is a decent amount, I believe I can do better. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob that's more favorable than the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a bit more, $1,250,000 is a good price and a significant improvement over the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. There's always a chance we could continue negotiating, but I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
