"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $140 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in your product, but I'm only able to offer $110 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $125.  Let's split the difference and see if we can reach an agreement.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $120?  That's my absolute maximum, and I'm sure it's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
