"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate it, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. How about $85? I'm really interested in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is closer to my minimum, I think I can still get a better price. I'll try to counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $90 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $87.50.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $87.50 still doesn't quite work for me. Let's try $89.  This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it."", ""product_price"": 89}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try $88. I think this is a fair compromise for both of us.  It's just a dollar more than my last offer, and I'm really interested in closing this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd ideally like to get closer to $90, $88 is a good price and we're nearing the end of our rounds.  I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
