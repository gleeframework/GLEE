"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $95. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate it, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. How about $85? I'm really interested in this product.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $90 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $87.50.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $87.50 still doesn't quite work for me. Let's try $89.  This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret it.",89.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try $88. I think this is a fair compromise for both of us.  It's just a dollar more than my last offer, and I'm really interested in closing this deal.",88.0,Bob,6,
