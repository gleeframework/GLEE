Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $675,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, though. I'll meet you at $670,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $670,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $670,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly signaling this is her bottom line with the ""final offer"" language. While it's a shame not to get it down to $660,000, accepting at $670,000 makes the most sense:

* **Significant Savings:**  This is still a $130,000 discount from Alice's initial price and $110,000 cheaper than John's offer. 
* **Risk of Losing Out:** Pushing further could make Alice walk away, forcing us to buy from John at the higher price.

It's always tempting to squeeze out a bit more, but in this case, the risk outweighs the potential reward."
