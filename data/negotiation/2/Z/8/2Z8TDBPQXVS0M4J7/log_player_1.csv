Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation and ensures I make a profit. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll carefully analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While it's tempting to accept his offer since it's better than nothing, I'm going to reject it and make a counteroffer. It's worth exploring if I can get closer to my desired price range before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm countering with a price of $12,000. This is still a good profit margin for me, and it's a more reasonable compromise than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $11,000 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While I would have preferred to get closer to my initial asking price, this is a reasonable outcome and I'm willing to accept it to avoid risking further negotiation and potentially losing the sale altogether."
