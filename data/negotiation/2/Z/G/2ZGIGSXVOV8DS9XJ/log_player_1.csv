Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm asking for $1,490,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1490000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price very close to John's offer ($1,500,000) sets a strong anchor. Even though it's negotiable, it positions the product as highly valuable in Bob's mind. 
* **Slight Negotiation Room:** Offering a slight discount ($10,000) acknowledges Bob's potential need for negotiation while still staying very close to your desired outcome.
* **Justification of Value:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value and potential"" to subtly remind Bob that the product is worth more than his initial valuation.

**Why not lower?**

Offering a significantly lower price risks:

* **Leaving money on the table:**  If Bob is willing to pay close to $1,500,000, a lower offer reduces your potential profit.
* **Devaluing the product:** A dramatically lower price might make Bob question the product's worth and make him less likely to accept. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
