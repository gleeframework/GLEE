"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth significantly more to you. Let me know your thoughts!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to see a figure closer to $950,000 to make this work. This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product for your business. Let's find a compromise that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer $925,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product for my business.",925000.0,Bob,4,
