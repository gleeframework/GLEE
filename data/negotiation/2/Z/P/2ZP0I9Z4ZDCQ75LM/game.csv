"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think you'll find it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. I'm confident that the product will be worth it to you in the long run.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,700,000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $1,650,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to make a reasonable profit.",1650000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $1,675,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I think this price reflects the value of the product and is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can shake on it!",1675000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there. Let's try $1,662,500. It's a small difference, but it gets us closer to a deal. I'm confident that this is a fair price, and I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement.",1662500.0,Bob,6,
