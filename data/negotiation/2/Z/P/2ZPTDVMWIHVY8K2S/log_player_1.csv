Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value of $12,000 but leaves room for negotiation. 

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me at this price.  If not, I'll have to assess his counteroffer and determine whether I should continue negotiating with him or sell to John instead."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm happy to sell the product for $12,000, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's initial offer is too low, and I'm willing to see if we can find a compromise. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm countering with $13,500. This is a compromise, as it's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I hope this shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm still not willing to settle for his initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now too low for me.  While I'd like to make a deal with him, I'm not willing to go below my minimum price of $12,000. John is willing to pay that price, and I'm happy to sell the product to him."
