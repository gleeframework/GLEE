"Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's not worth it to buy from Alice at $180.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
``` 

Bob is aiming for the absolute minimum price he's willing to pay. This counteroffer reflects that and might start a negotiation process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $160 is better than $180, it's still more than Bob's maximum price of $80.  He should continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

Bob is still trying to find a middle ground. He's offering $100, which is halfway between his maximum price and Alice's last offer. This might be a more appealing offer to Alice, as she is losing less profit than before."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $145 is a good price, Bob is still within his budget and can try to get it even lower. He should reject the offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

Bob is continuing to negotiate by offering a price slightly above his max price.  At this point, it seems likely that Alice will either accept this offer or  counter with a price closer to $120.  If Alice rejects this offer, Bob should buy from John for $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is not budging much, and Bob has reached his maximum price. It's time to stop the negotiation and buy from John for $80."
