{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is much higher than both my upper limit ($12,000) and her product's value to her ($15,000). There's plenty of room for negotiation."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way out of my budget. This product would be valuable to me at a lower price point. How about $10,000?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

Alice has come down in price, but it's still above both my limit and John's offer.  I'll hold out a bit longer and see if I can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but $14,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Could we settle on $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $14,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $13,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is getting close, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to John's offer. Alice seems motivated to sell, so I'll push a bit further."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit, but $13,000 is still a bit much for me. How about we split the difference and call it $12,500?"",
""product_price"": 12500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $13,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $12,750. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice is clearly unwilling to budge below $12,500.  It's not worth the risk of her digging in further. I can get the product for a sure $12,000 from John."
