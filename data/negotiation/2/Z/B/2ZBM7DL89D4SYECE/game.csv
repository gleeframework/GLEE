"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way out of my budget. This product would be valuable to me at a lower price point. How about $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I still think the product has a lot of value to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but $14,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Could we settle on $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $13,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit, but $13,000 is still a bit much for me. How about we split the difference and call it $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $12,750. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",12750.0,Alice,7,
