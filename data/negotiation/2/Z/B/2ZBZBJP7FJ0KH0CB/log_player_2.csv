Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial price. Since I'm looking to save as much money as possible, I'll aim for a price that's closer to what I'm willing to pay, which is $10,000.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $9,000 undervalues the product's capabilities.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500. I believe this price point represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer is still too high for me. I'd like to reject her offer and make another counteroffer. Since I'm getting closer to the maximum amount I'm willing to pay, I'll try to make a more aggressive counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer that is even lower than my previous one. Since I'm not willing to pay more than $10,000, I'll aim for a price that's even closer to that amount.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $8,500. I believe this is a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value and my budget."", ""product_price"": 8500}"
