Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 99
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I could offer the product at $100 and guarantee a sale to John, there's a chance Bob will pay a bit more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $99 is just below my minimum acceptable price and significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle but still secures me a good profit. 
* **""Special Price"" Psychology:**  By framing it as a ""special price,"" I hope to incentivize Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer without much back and forth."
