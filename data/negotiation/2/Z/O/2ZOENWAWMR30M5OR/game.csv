"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $8,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a little more. How about $9,000?  I think it's a fair price considering the value it offers.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $8,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $8,500 is too high, how about $8,200? I'm willing to compromise.",8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $8,200 is simply too low. I'm willing to go down to $8,800, which is a significant compromise on my part. If you're truly interested in this product, I believe this is a fair price we can both agree on.",8800.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit away from my target price. How about we meet at $8,400? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.",8400.0,Bob,6,
