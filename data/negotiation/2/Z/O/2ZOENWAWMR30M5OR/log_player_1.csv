"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable selling it for so far below my minimum. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $8,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a little more. How about $9,000?  I think it's a fair price considering the value it offers."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $8,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $8,500 is too high, how about $8,200? I'm willing to compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,200 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob and try to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $8,200 is simply too low. I'm willing to go down to $8,800, which is a significant compromise on my part. If you're truly interested in this product, I believe this is a fair price we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit away from my target price. How about we meet at $8,400? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting too close to my minimum price, and I'm not sure I can get much higher with him.  To avoid risking a deal below my target, I'm going to sell the product to John.  It's a secure sale and will guarantee me my minimum desired price."
