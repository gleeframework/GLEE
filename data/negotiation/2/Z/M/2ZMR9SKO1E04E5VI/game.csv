"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to be flexible to close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're hesitant about the price. But $950,000 is still a bit below my minimum. How about $1,000,000? That's a fair price considering the value of the product. It's my final offer, let me know your decision.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
