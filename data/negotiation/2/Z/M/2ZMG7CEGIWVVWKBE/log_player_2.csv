"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe holds tremendous value.  Based on my understanding of its potential, I'm setting an initial price of $1800000. I'm open to discussing this further, but I'm confident this is a fair starting point.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget. While I'm interested in the product, I'm only able to offer $1,300,000 at this time. This reflects the value I see in the product and my current financial capacity.  I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your financial constraints. While $1300000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1500000. This takes into account your budget and still allows me to get closer to the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,500,000 is exactly your maximum budget.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee that you'll get a lower price from Alice, and you risk losing the opportunity altogether. Buying from John for the same price would be a waste of time, as there's no potential for saving money."
