Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget. While I'm interested in the product, I'm only able to offer $1300000 at this time. This reflects the value I see in the product and my current financial capacity.  I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,500,000. This takes into account your budget and still allows me to get closer to the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
