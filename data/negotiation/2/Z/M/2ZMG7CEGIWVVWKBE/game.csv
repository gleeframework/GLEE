"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe holds tremendous value.  Based on my understanding of its potential, I'm setting an initial price of $1800000. I'm open to discussing this further, but I'm confident this is a fair starting point.  What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget. While I'm interested in the product, I'm only able to offer $1300000 at this time. This reflects the value I see in the product and my current financial capacity.  I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your financial constraints. While $1300000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1500000. This takes into account your budget and still allows me to get closer to the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
