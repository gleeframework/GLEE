"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but based on my assessment, I am only willing to pay up to $700,000 for it. I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, however,  $700,000 is significantly below its actual value.  I could consider a price of $900,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of the product while still offering you substantial benefit.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am unable to agree to $900,000. I would like to propose a price of $850,000. I hope this aligns better with the value we both see in the product.",850000.0,Bob,4,
