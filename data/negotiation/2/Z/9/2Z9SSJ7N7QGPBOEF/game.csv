"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm motivated to sell, $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, but $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $12,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, but I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",12800.0,Bob,4,
