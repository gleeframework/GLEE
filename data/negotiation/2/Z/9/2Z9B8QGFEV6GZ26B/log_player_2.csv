Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Since you're aiming to save as much money as possible, it's worthwhile to see if you can get a better deal from Alice. You're willing to pay up to $100, and Alice's offer is close to that.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $85. This is a reasonable starting point, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but also indicating that I'm willing to negotiate.  It's a good starting point that leaves room for further bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $95 is closer to my maximum price of $100, I'm still hoping to save more. Alice has raised her offer, so I'll try to counter again to see if I can get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm raising my counteroffer to $90.  Since Alice has moved closer to my target price, I'll meet her halfway. This shows I'm serious about a deal but still trying to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now $97. This is only $3 away from my maximum price of $100.  With only 5 rounds left, it's becoming risky to keep rejecting offers.  The chance of getting a better deal is diminishing, and it's more likely that Alice will either stick to her price or increase it further.  Accepting this offer ensures I get the product and saves me some money compared to buying from John."
