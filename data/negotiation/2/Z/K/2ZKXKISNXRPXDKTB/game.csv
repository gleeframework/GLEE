"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I think $850,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is significantly lower than the product's true value.  I'm willing to be flexible and come down to $800,000, which is a price that reflects the product's worth. This is my final offer.  Let me know your decision.",800000.0,Alice,3,
