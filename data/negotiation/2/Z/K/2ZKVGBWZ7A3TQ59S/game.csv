"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $800000 to $900000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $850000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise slightly. I'm prepared to offer the product for $1200000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer and, I believe, a fair price considering the value I place on this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
