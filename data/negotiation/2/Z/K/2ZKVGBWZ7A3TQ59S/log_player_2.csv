Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $850000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise slightly. I'm prepared to offer the product for $1200000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer and, I believe, a fair price considering the value I place on this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
