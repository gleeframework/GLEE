"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1200000, which is significantly lower than its true worth. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully. If you decline, I will be selling it to another buyer for a much higher price.  Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
