Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $60 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $90.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $75 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not budging much on price. Her offer of $95 is still significantly higher than John's offer of $80. It's unlikely she'll come down to a price you're happy with in the remaining rounds. It makes more financial sense to buy from John at this point."
