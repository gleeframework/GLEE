"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, $120 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Since Bob's offer of $80 is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, I'll sell the product to Bob.
