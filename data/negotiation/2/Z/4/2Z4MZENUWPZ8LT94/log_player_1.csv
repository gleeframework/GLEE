Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $20,000, considering its incredible potential."", ""product_price"": 20000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting significantly higher than both my minimum price and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and creates the perception that the product is highly valued.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""incredible potential,"" I'm aiming to pique Bob's interest and potentially shift his perception of the product's value.

It's important to note that this is just the opening move.  I'm prepared to negotiate based on Bob's responses and will leverage the option to sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am interested in purchasing the product for $15,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's standing offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's willingness to counter at $15,000 suggests he values the product and might be willing to go higher.  I'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $15,000 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,500?"", ""product_price"": 17500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm signaling a willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a price above both his initial offer and my minimum. 
* **Justification:** By saying ""meet in the middle,"" I'm framing the offer as a fair compromise, potentially making it more appealing to Bob.

I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a fallback, but I believe there's still potential to secure a better deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I still believe I can secure a better deal elsewhere. I would like to propose a price of $15,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob has held firm at $15,000, matching John's offer.  Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a significantly better result. It's time to cut my losses and secure the sale at the best price currently available."
