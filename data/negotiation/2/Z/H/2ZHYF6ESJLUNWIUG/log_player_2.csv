"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above the product's value to her. I can likely get a better deal by counter-offering.  There's room to negotiate without immediately resorting to John's offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to part with the product for $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still too high.  While it's a slight decrease, I'm still paying more than the product is worth to her. I'll counter-offer again, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
