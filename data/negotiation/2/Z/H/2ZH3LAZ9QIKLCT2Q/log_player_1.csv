prompt,response
Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **One Shot:** You only have one chance with Bob before you go to John.

**Strategy**

The ideal outcome is to sell the product to Bob for the highest price he's willing to pay before he realizes you have another buyer.  

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will significantly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Language:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value proposition"" subtly reinforce the product's desirability.
* **High but Reasonable Price:**  $1,400,000 gives Bob a $100,000 discount on his perceived value while securing a substantial profit for you.
* **Call to Action:**  ""Let me know your thoughts"" encourages Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer, in which case you'd still have your guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. However, this strategy aims to maximize your potential profit."
