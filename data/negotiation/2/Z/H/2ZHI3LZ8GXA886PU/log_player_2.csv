Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts in this negotiation. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price.  However, I value our discussions and believe we can still reach an agreement. My final offer is $875,000.  This is a considerable compromise and the lowest I can go.

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, her latest offer is still significantly higher than John's price.  Waiting to see if Alice will go lower isn't worth the risk, especially since she's mentioned another buyer.  Buying from John guarantees the best price for you."
