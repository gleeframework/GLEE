"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1050000. This still leaves you a healthy profit margin, and it's the highest I'm comfortable going at this point.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $1050000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1100000.  This is a fair compromise, and it still allows for a significant profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
