# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1050000. This still leaves you a healthy profit margin, and it's the highest I'm comfortable going at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
