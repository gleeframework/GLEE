"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product has the potential to be incredibly valuable for you. I'm offering it to you for $1150000.  I think this price reflects its worth while still giving you a good margin for profit. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still above the product's worth to her ($1,000,000).  There's room for negotiation to potentially get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and attempt to further reduce the cost."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This still leaves you a healthy profit margin, and it's the highest I'm comfortable going at this point."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $1050000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1100000.  This is a fair compromise, and it still allows for a significant profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is within Bob's budget and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John for $1,200,000.  It's also a good price for Alice, leaving her a profit margin above the product's worth to her. Accepting the offer is the most financially beneficial option for Bob at this point."
