Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested, $1,300,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This reflects the value it holds for me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
