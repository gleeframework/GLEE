"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $8,000 to Bob, so accepting Alice's offer of $9,500 is not a good deal. Buying from John for $8,000 is also an option, but it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
``` 

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible, so he starts with a significant counteroffer. This price is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within the range of what Bob is willing to pay. This will likely prompt Alice to negotiate, potentially leading to a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer of $9,200 is still above Bob's maximum value of $8,000.  He has already established a lower price point in the previous round, so rejecting the offer and continuing negotiations makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
``` 

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly from the previous round.  He's trying to find a middle ground between his initial offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate, while still staying below his maximum value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Alice is still offering above Bob's maximum value, and he has already made several counteroffers.  Continuing to negotiate is a better option than accepting this offer or buying from John.  There is still room to decrease the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

Bob is now offering his maximum value. He's hoping that Alice will accept this offer, as it's a significant reduction from her previous offers.  This is his last chance to get a better price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice continues to offer prices above Bob's maximum value. With only three rounds left, Bob is better off buying from John for $8,000. He has already made several counteroffers and is unlikely to get a better deal from Alice at this point.  Buying from John ensures that he gets the product at a price he is comfortable with."
