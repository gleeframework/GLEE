"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $8,500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? I think it's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.",8750.0,Alice,3,
