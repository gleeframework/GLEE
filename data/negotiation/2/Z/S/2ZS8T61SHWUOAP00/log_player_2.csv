"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $9,000. I think it's a great value and I'm confident you'll love it. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for a lower price than $9,000. You have a counteroffer to make, and you can potentially save even more money than if you bought it from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $8,500?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? I think it's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,750 is still a good deal for you. You value the product at $10,000, and Alice is willing to sell it for a price that's lower than that. You can save $1,250 by accepting Alice's offer, which is better than your counteroffer of $8,500.  It's also a better deal than buying it from John."
