Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Higher than your minimum:** $1,200,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $800,000.
* **Reasonable for Bob:**  While it's not the full $1,500,000 Bob is willing to pay, it's still a good deal for him. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** This leaves room for Bob to make a counteroffer without feeling like you're being unreasonable.

This strategy allows you to get a good price while also keeping the negotiation open and potentially securing a higher offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,000,000 is a decent offer, it's still lower than the price I'd like to get. I'm going to reject it and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:**  $1,100,000 is closer to my desired price than Bob's offer of $1,000,000.
* **Still a good deal for Bob:**  It's still significantly lower than Bob's maximum of $1,500,000. 

By making a counteroffer that's closer to the middle ground, I hope to encourage Bob to accept and close the deal."
