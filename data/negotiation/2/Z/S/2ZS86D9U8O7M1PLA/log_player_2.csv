"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  You can potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer. You have a significant buffer ($300,000) between Alice's offer and what you're willing to pay.  

It's worth exploring if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $1,000,000, which is still significantly less than what Alice wants, but also leaves a good margin for her to profit. This counteroffer shows that I'm serious about buying the product but also willing to negotiate. I'm hoping that Alice will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than my initial offer, and it's also lower than the price I'd pay from John. Accepting this offer allows me to save $400,000 compared to buying from John. It's a good deal, and there's no need to risk further negotiation."
