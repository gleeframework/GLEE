"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you place on this product, $12,000 is unfortunately outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is a fair price considering my needs and the product's overall value. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in our product.

This offers a compromise that could potentially meet both our expectations.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $8,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",8000.0,Bob,4,
