Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $80, we want to start with an offer closer to our minimum acceptable price ($150). This leaves room for negotiation or allows us to slightly lower the price and still make a good profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $140 implies there might be some flexibility, potentially enticing Bob to counter-offer.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have the security of John as a buyer at $150. This means we're not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
