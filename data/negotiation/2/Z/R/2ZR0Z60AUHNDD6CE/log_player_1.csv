{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $11,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Higher than your minimum:** It's above your $10,000 minimum, maximizing potential profit.
* **Lower than Bob's perceived value:**  $11,500 is still below what Bob is willing to pay, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Open-ended:** The message encourages Bob to respond and start a dialogue. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think $11,500 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $10,800 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer.  Rejecting it allows you to try to push for a higher price. You can counteroffer and try to close the gap between your desired price and Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down a bit to $11,200. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11200}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is a compromise:** It's a step closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility.
* **Maintains a decent profit:** It's still above your minimum and leaves you with a good margin.
* **Remains open for discussion:** The message invites further negotiation and keeps the conversation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,900 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still not ideal. Rejecting it keeps the negotiation open and allows you to make one final counteroffer before considering selling to John. You can try to push for a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I want to make this work. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,050. This is my final offer, and it reflects the value I've placed on this product. Let me know if you're interested in finalizing the deal."", ""product_price"": 11050}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is a small compromise:** It's only $150 higher than Bob's last offer, showing you're serious about closing the deal.
* **Still profitable:** It's still above your minimum and gives you a decent profit.
* **States it's final:**  This adds pressure on Bob to either accept or walk away. 

Let's see if this is enough to convince Bob!"
