Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $11,500, which reflects its true value."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down slightly. 
* **Above Minimum:** This offer ensures a profit above your $10,000 minimum if Bob accepts.
* **Alternative Option:** While you have John as a backup, it's better to secure a higher price from Bob if possible."
