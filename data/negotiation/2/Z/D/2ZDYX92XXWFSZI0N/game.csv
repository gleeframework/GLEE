"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $11,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $10,000 is your maximum budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can offer it to you for $10,050. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for the product.",10050.0,Alice,7,
