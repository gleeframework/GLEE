Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $115 for it."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible without going below your minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $115 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting you closer to your desired profit.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John gives you leverage. You don't have to desperately accept a low offer from Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. Depending on your negotiation style and how much you know about Bob, you might choose a different approach."
