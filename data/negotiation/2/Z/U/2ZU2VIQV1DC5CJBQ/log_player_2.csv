"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic product at a competitive price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal. He knows the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the competitive pricing, but I'm looking to get this product for closer to $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,050,000?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price. However, I'm still looking to make a good profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1075000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price point. While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice will reject further offers, forcing him to buy from John at $1,000,000.  At $1,075,000, Bob is getting a good deal while still saving $25,000 compared to Alice's initial offer. It's a reasonable compromise."
