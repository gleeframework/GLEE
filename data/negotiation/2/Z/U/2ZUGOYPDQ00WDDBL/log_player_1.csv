Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're asking for more than your minimum of $8,000, aiming for a higher profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  Bob will see value in buying it for less than his perceived worth. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can potentially increase the price further if Bob accepts the offer.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
