"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable item. I'm confident you'll find it a great addition to your collection. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $1,200,000, and Alice's offer is exactly that price, there's no immediate benefit to accepting.  You can reject her offer and still purchase the product from John for the same price.  By rejecting, you open the possibility that Alice might lower her price to try and close the deal."
