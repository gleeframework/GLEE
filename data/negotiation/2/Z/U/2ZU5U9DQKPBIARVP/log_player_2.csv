"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $15,000 is way above his budget and he can get the product from John for significantly less.  There's no need to negotiate with Alice at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is still a fair price given its value to me."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. How about we agree on $13,000?  This reflects the product's worth while still offering you a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price.  He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still outside my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase.  While $10,000 is still below what I hoped for, I value closing this deal.  How about we split the difference at $11,500? This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has already made several counteroffers and Alice has rejected them. While $11,500 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his budget.  He can get the product from John for $8,000, so it's time to stop negotiating with Alice and go with the sure thing."
