"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  $18,000 is above his budget, so rejecting and counter-offering is the best first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm not quite ready to pay that much. I'm willing to go up to $15,500 for this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're a savvy buyer, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make an offer. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $15,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $17,000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is still trying to save money and $17,000 is still too high. Rejecting and counter-offering again is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm willing to pay $16,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can get this done."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about making a deal, Bob. However, I still need to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $16,500. That's the lowest I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still trying to get a better price, and $16,500 is still too high. Even though it's closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate further.  There are more rounds left and Bob should keep trying to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to get a good price, but I'm still only willing to go up to $16,000. It's my final offer. Let me know if you want to do this deal."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to accept $16,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $16,250. That's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has reached his limit.  While $16,250 is closer to his budget than Alice's previous offers, he's been consistently trying to get down to $16,000. Alice has made it clear she won't budge, and Bob only has a few rounds left.  It's best to cut his losses and go with the guaranteed price from John."
