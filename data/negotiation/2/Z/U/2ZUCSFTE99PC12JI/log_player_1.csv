Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $120, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but still below the value to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Framing it as a fair price:** I'm not just stating a number, I'm framing it as a ""fair price"" to increase the chances of acceptance.
* **Engaging Bob:** The message asks for Bob's opinion, encouraging him to participate in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:** While $100 is better than selling to John for $80, it's still significantly lower than the value I know the product holds for Bob.
* **Negotiation potential:** By rejecting, I can potentially negotiate a higher price in the next round, closer to my desired $120. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's a risk Bob might walk away, the potential reward of a higher price justifies rejecting his offer for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget concerns.  I'm willing to come down to $110,  which is still a great deal considering the product's value.  Let's meet in the middle on this."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price, but not by too much. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Meeting in the middle:**  Framing it as a ""middle ground"" makes the offer seem fair and reasonable.
* **Focus on value:**  I'm still emphasizing the product's value to reinforce the price justification."
