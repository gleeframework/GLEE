Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 950000} 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $950,000. This price is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I'm not willing to accept it yet. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm offering the product for $900,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I believe this price is fair, considering the value to Bob and my own minimum acceptable price."
