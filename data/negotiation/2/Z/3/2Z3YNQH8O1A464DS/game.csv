"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1200000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my maximum budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $950000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the fact that I'm willing to compromise.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $875000.  This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my maximum budget. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $875000, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you at $920000, which is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you and my minimum selling price. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",920000.0,Alice,5,
