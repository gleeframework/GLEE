{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to Bob, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to create a sense of urgency and potentially increase Bob's desire to buy it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $14000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum price point. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $10,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $12,500?  That's still a great price considering the value of the product.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12500 is still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $11250? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,250 is a good compromise. While it's still slightly below my minimum price point, it's closer to my ideal outcome.  Accepting his offer will secure a sale and allow me to move on."
