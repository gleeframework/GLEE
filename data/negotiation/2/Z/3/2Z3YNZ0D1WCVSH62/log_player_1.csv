"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $11,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if he's willing to pay close to my minimum acceptable value of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $9,500 is still too low for me, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'm not yet ready to sell to John, because I think I can still get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob at $10,500. This is still a good price for me, and I think it's more likely to be acceptable to Bob than my previous offer. I'm trying to find a middle ground that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $9,000 is still too low, and I'm not yet ready to settle. I'm hopeful that I can get closer to my desired price in the remaining rounds.  However, with only 6 rounds remaining, I am getting closer to the point where selling to John might be the better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm dropping my price slightly to $10,000. This is still a good price for me, but I'm acknowledging that Bob is unlikely to go much higher.  It's also closer to the middle ground. We are getting to the point where time is becoming a factor, so I need to be more flexible to secure a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $8,800 is far too low. I'm running out of time, but I'm still hopeful I can get a better price from Bob.  Selling to John is becoming a more attractive option with each round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer of $9,750. This is a significant concession, but it's still above my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.  It's also closer to the middle ground than my previous offer.  I'm hoping that Bob will see that this is a fair price and we can finally reach an agreement.  However, if he rejects this offer, I will be forced to sell the product to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm selling to John.  I've reached the point where I'm running out of time and Bob isn't willing to negotiate any further.  While I would have preferred to get closer to my ideal price, selling to John for $12,000 is the most sensible option at this point."
