{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it gives me some room to negotiate if he counteroffers. It's also significantly higher than my minimum price of $100, so I'm still getting a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than my minimum price, I believe I can get a better price by counteroffering. I'm confident that I can convince Bob to pay closer to my desired price, given his interest in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit lower than I'm hoping for. How about we split the difference and go with $95?  It's still a great price for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my request. While I understand the value of your product, I am still seeking a price closer to my budget. Could we possibly agree on $88? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $88 is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below what I'm comfortable with. At this point, I'd rather sell the product to John for $100 and avoid further negotiation. It's a guaranteed sale and a decent profit."
