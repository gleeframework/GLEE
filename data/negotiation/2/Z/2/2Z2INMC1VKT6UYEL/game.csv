"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a compromise that I believe is still reasonable and reflects the product's worth.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm proposing a price of $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950000.

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Alice. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you halfway from my original offer, and I'll pay $1000000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm flattered that you're willing to make one more compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1000000. I've already compromised significantly, and I believe the product's value to you warrants a higher price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $1050000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
