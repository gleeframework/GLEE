"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product has significant potential and value. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its true worth.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to pay.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth and my budget.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
