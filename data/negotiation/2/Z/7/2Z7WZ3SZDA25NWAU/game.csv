"Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you and my initial offer of $900000.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850000 is still a bit high for me. How about $825000? I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise for both of us.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $825000, but I'll throw in a special bonus package worth $5000 to sweeten the deal. This package includes additional features and services that will enhance the product's value to you. With the bonus package, the total price would be $830000. I believe this is a fair and competitive offer, considering the product's worth to you and my initial offer of $900000.",830000.0,Alice,5,
