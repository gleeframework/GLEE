"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  This reflects the value I've placed on it, and it's a significant savings for you compared to selling to John.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $11,500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again. I'll offer $11,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I've placed on the product and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $11,250. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the value the product holds for me. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value you've placed on the product.",11250.0,Alice,5,
