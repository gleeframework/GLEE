"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product but $120 is a bit out of my budget. How about $90? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $90. I appreciate your interest in the product! After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $110. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $110 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $105? I really want this product and I believe this price is fair for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your revised offer of $105. I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $115? I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to part with it for that amount.",115.0,Alice,5,
