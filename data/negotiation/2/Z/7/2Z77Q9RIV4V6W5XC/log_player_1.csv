Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that I believe is fair.  Consider this:  $1,250,000. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident the potential value for you is substantial. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** This message is designed to pique Bob's interest and establish a sense of value without revealing too much about the product.  It highlights the high value to me while presenting a seemingly ""fair"" price.
* **Product Price:**  $1,250,000 is a price that allows for potential profit while acknowledging John's offer as a safety net. This price is high enough to potentially be attractive to Bob, while still providing me with a better return than John's offer. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** By setting a price higher than John's offer, I have the chance to earn more.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** The message probes Bob's potential value perception without revealing too much.
* **Maintain Flexibility:** If Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed backup with John."
