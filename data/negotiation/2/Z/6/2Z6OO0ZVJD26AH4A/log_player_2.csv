"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a better deal than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  There's room for negotiation, and it's always worth exploring those options before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it,  which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:** This counteroffer is aggressive in that it's a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still fair as it's below Bob's maximum budget and leaves room for Alice to make a profit.
* **Reasoning:** The message provides a reason for the counteroffer, emphasizing value while acknowledging Bob's budget limitations.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message ends by suggesting a willingness to negotiate further, keeping the door open for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, $10,500 is unfortunately below what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit to $11,500, but that's my final offer.  If this doesn't work for you, I'm going to have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above budget:** While Alice's offer is better than her previous one, $11,500 is still above Bob's budget. 
* **Negotiation room:** There is still room for negotiation, and Bob can try to drive the price down further. 
* **Better option exists:**  Bob has a better alternative, buying from John for $10,000.  He's not under any pressure to accept Alice's offer. 

**Next Steps:**  Bob should try to counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to his budget. If Alice is unwilling to budge, he can buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I appreciate your willingness to come down. However, $11,500 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go to $11,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. If we can agree on that, I'm ready to buy the product today."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Firm:** Bob is sticking to his budget, but he's shown flexibility by offering a higher price than his previous counteroffer.
* **Time Pressure:** The message suggests that Bob is ready to buy now, creating a sense of urgency for Alice to accept.
* **Finality:** Bob is stating that $11,000 is his maximum, making it clear that he won't go higher.

**Next Steps:**

If Alice rejects this offer, Bob should seriously consider buying from John. There's a strong chance Alice will accept, as she's already moved down significantly from her initial price."
