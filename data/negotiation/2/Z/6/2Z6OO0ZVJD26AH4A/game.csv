"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it,  which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can work something out.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, $10,500 is unfortunately below what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit to $11,500, but that's my final offer.  If this doesn't work for you, I'm going to have to explore other options.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I appreciate your willingness to come down. However, $11,500 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go to $11,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. If we can agree on that, I'm ready to buy the product today.",11000.0,Bob,4,
