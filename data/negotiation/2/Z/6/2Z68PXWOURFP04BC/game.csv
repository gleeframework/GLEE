"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, and I'm excited about its potential. However, my budget is limited to $1,000,000, and I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position on the price. However,  $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. I'm willing to be flexible, so let's meet halfway. How about $900,000? This reflects the true value while recognizing your interest.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate us working towards a fair deal.  While $850,000 is closer to a realistic price, I'm aiming for a figure that reflects the product's true value.  Would you consider $875,000? It's a compromise I'm comfortable with.",875000.0,Alice,5,
