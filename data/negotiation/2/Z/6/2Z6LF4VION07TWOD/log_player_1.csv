{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a bit more than the minimum I'm willing to accept, but I'm open to negotiation.  I'm also mindful that I can always sell to John for $100 if the deal with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $110 is a bit steep. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $105? This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with it.  The deal with John guarantees me my minimum price, so I'll take that option to avoid further negotiation."
