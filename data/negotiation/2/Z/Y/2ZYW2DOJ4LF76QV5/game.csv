"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm afraid I can't meet you at $90. I can do $110, which is the lowest I can go. I'm confident you'll find it's worth it!",110.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $110, so I'll offer it to you for $105. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it!",105.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $110. I can see you're really interested in the product, so I'll meet you at $102. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",102.0,Alice,7,

"I've already told you, Bob, I'm not willing to go below $110. I'm starting to think you're not serious about buying the product. I'll give you one last chance to meet me at $107. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",107.0,Alice,9,

"I've made it clear that I'm not willing to go below $110, Bob. I think it's time to be honest with you, I've had a better offer from another buyer, and I'm considering selling to them instead. I'll give you one last chance to meet me at $108. If not, I'll have to go with the other buyer.",108.0,Alice,11,
