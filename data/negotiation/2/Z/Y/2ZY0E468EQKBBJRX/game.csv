"Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you our premium product for $12,000. I believe this price reflects the value you would place on the product, given its worth to you is $15,000. Please let me know if this offer meets your expectations or if you'd like to discuss further.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering it's worth $8,000 to you and I'm willing to pay more than that. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. After careful consideration, I am unable to accept $10,000 for the product. My next offer for the product is $11,000. I hope this price better aligns with our negotiation goals.",11000.0,Alice,3,
