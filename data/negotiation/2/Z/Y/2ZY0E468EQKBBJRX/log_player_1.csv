"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering it's worth $8,000 to you and I'm willing to pay more than that. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
