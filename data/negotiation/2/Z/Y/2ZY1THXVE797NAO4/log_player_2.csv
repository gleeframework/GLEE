"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  It's much more beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  Buying from John would be a last resort if negotiation fails."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but my initial price reflects the true value of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This would be a significant compromise on my end. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial $1,200,000, it's still above Bob's budget of $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice will come down to Bob's price.  Buying from John is still a viable option if negotiations fail."
