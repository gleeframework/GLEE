,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I think this product is great, $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'd be happy to pay $115 for it. What do you think?",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. That's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with this product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $120, which is what I'd pay from John.  Let me know if you're open to that.",120.0,Bob,4,
