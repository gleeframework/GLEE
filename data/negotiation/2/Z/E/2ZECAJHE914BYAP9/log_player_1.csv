"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal considering its value to me! Let's see if we can make a deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but still below what the product is worth to me. 
* **Message:** I'm framing it as a ""steal"" to make it more attractive to Bob and suggest room for negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation and maximize my potential profit. I'm also aiming to see how interested Bob is in the product before making further concessions. I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tighter budget. How about we start at $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price and even lower than his own valuation. While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price. 

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiations and potentially get a better price. I'll use the next round to counteroffer with a price that is more aligned with my minimum and still leaves room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to be flexible, though. Let's meet in the middle at $900,000. This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value you placed on the product."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation. This shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but also that I'm not willing to settle for an extremely low offer.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's initial offer while emphasizing the value of the product for him. By suggesting a compromise, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to move closer to my asking price. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a balance between firmness and flexibility in this round. I'm sticking to a price that's higher than Bob's initial offer, but lower than my initial offer. I'm also trying to appeal to Bob's sense of logic by highlighting the value he would receive from the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle.  How about we try $750,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired range.  I need to see if I can push him higher.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer again in the next round. This will allow me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better price.  It's risky, but I'm still hopeful I can get closer to my $1 million target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down a bit more, though.  Let's try $850,000. This would give you a great deal on a product that you value at $800,000.  It's a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $850,000, which is significantly closer to my minimum price and still allows for a slight profit margin. It also leaves room for negotiation in case Bob pushes for a lower price.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and highlighting the potential for a win-win situation. By emphasizing the value he places on the product, I'm trying to motivate him to accept a higher price.

**Strategy:**

I'm continuing to hold firm on my minimum price while also demonstrating flexibility. By offering a compromise, I'm trying to maintain a positive dialogue and push Bob towards a more agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we are getting very close. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $775,000. This demonstrates my seriousness about the deal while acknowledging the value you place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I need to see if I can push him higher, even if it risks losing the deal.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer again in the next round.  Time is running out, so I need to make a decision soon.  I might be willing to accept a slightly lower price in the next round if it seems like Bob won't budge further, but I'm still hoping for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $812,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value we both place on it.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 812500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $812,500, which is the midpoint between Bob's last offer and my previous offer. This demonstrates my flexibility and willingness to compromise while still securing a price closer to my minimum.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the offer and suggesting that it's in both our interests to close the deal. I'm also reiterating the value of the product to build a sense of urgency and motivate Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

With only a few rounds left, I'm aiming to reach a compromise that secures a decent profit while avoiding the risk of losing the deal entirely.  This counteroffer shows a willingness to meet halfway, which could encourage Bob to accept.  However, I'm still prepared to walk away if necessary, especially if Bob continues to lowball.  The next few rounds will be crucial in determining the final outcome of the negotiation."
