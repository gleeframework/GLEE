"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $12,000. I'm hoping to get a price closer to my minimum of $15,000, but I'm also aware that I have the option of selling to John if negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $14,000 is a decent offer, I believe I can do better. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still holding out for a higher price than Bob's initial counteroffer. I'm hoping this will show Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price, but also willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum price, and I'm happy to accept it. There's no guarantee that I'll be able to get a higher price in the remaining rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob completely."
