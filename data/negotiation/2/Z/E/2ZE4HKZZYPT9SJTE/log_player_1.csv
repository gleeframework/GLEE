Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000. This is a good starting point. It's significantly more than what the product is worth to him, but still leaves some room for negotiation and potential profit for me. 

It's important to remember that I have a backup buyer in John who will pay $12,000, so I'm not desperate to make a deal with Bob. This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's closer to his valuation of the product, it's still significantly below what I consider fair.  I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer.  I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a decent price for me. It's also a reasonable step towards Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. It's important to keep in mind that John is still waiting, so I'm not under pressure to sell to Bob at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still not enough for me.  I've already spent time negotiating with him, and while I could continue, John is waiting to buy for a significantly higher price.  

At this point, it's best to cut my losses and sell to John. I'm confident I'll make a better deal with John, and I can spend my time pursuing other opportunities."
