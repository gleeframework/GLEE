{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $170. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than what the product is worth to me, but still lower than what John is willing to pay. This gives me some room to negotiate with Bob, while also ensuring I get a decent price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low, even considering it's worth $80 to him. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest but $60 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $120, which is still a great deal considering what the product is worth. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product but I have a budget in mind. How about $75? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, even though he claims it's his final offer. I'm not going to waste any more time trying to negotiate with him. I'm going to sell the product to John for $150, which is a much better price for me."
