Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $1,200,000, which is its minimum value to me. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While I value this product at $1,200,000, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair price that reflects its value to you while also allowing me to reach my minimum.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,150,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,050,000. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob's offer is getting too low.  I'm not comfortable selling below my minimum price of $1,200,000.  It's time to take the guaranteed offer from John."
