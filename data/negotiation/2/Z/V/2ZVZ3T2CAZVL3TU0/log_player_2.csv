"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me right now. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter-offer.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than your offer reflects.  Let's find a middle ground - I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but that's still a bit too rich for me. I could go up to $700,000.  If that doesn't work, we might need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our valuations remains substantial.  To be frank, walking away with anything less than $1,600,000 would not be worthwhile for me. That's my final offer, and I believe it's a fair one considering the value this product holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear she won't go below $1,600,000. This is far above your maximum price of $800,000 and John offers a guaranteed option at that price.  Continuing to negotiate is unlikely to close the gap and you risk losing the opportunity to secure the product from John."
