Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially even more than it is to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. I think that's a fair price that reflects its significance."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with a slightly lower offer ($1,400,000) leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up if he desires. 
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000 provides a strong fallback position, allowing for a bolder initial offer to Bob."
