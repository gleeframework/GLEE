Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,000?  This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it would still be a great deal for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
