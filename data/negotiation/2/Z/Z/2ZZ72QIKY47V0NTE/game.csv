"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $15000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12500?  This would still be a great deal for you, and I'd be able to move forward with the sale. ",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to pay $11500.  This is my final offer, let me know if you're willing to accept.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and go with $12000?  This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it would still be a great deal for you.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,5,
