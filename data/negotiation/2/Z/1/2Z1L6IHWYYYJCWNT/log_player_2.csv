"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is tailored to meet your specific needs. Considering its value to you, I propose a price of $12000. This offer includes a limited-time discount, ensuring you get the best deal possible. Please let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your budget. It's worth exploring the negotiation process further to see if you can secure a lower price.  There are 9 rounds left, and you might be able to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount. However, my budget is closer to $10,000. I'd be willing to buy the product for $10,500. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. To accommodate your situation, I would like to propose a price of $11000 for the product. This still offers a reasonable discount while ensuring we both benefit from the transaction. I hope this proposal aligns better with your financial planning. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is only $1,000 above your ideal price.  You've already demonstrated your willingness to negotiate, and further rounds might not yield a significantly better price. It's likely John's price will remain fixed, so taking Alice's offer is the safest bet to secure the product."
