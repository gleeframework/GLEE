Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I think $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.

We're still significantly above John's offer, so it makes sense to counter and see if Bob will budge further."

Round 6

While we're closer to our initial ask, Bob seems firm on his budget, and we're still significantly above John's offer. Accepting $1,900,000 guarantees a good profit at this point."
