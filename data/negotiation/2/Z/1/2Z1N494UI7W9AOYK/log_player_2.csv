"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. This item is not just any commodity; it's an investment in quality and excellence. Given its value to both us and you, we believe it's worth every penny of the $8,000 we're asking for. We understand that such a significant purchase requires careful consideration, so let's discuss how this product can enhance your needs and exceed your expectations. Should you decide to proceed, we're confident it will be a mutually beneficial transaction. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly set on the $8,000 price, highlighting its value and calling it an ""investment.""  While you're willing to pay that as a maximum, there's no harm in seeing if she'll come down a bit. Rejecting her offer opens the door for a potential counter-offer where she might lower the price to secure the sale. 

You're not at a disadvantage since you have John as a backup option at your target price."
