Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to try to get a better price than $950,000. Bob clearly values the product more than that, and I think I can get closer to my desired price range."
