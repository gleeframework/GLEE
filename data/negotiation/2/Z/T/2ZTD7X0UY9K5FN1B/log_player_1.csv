Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly valuable to you, and I'm aiming for a price around $18,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potential for a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  The message is designed to gauge Bob's interest and gather information about his perception of the product's value. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John provides leverage. You're not desperate to sell to Bob at any cost.

**Strategy:**

This offer allows Alice to:

1. **Potentially Secure a Higher Profit:** If Bob accepts the $18,000 price, Alice earns significantly more.
2. **Negotiate Down:** If Bob counters, Alice can gradually reduce the price, aiming to stay above the $12,000 mark.
3. **Walk Away:** If Bob's counteroffer is too low, Alice can politely decline and sell to John for the guaranteed $12,000."
