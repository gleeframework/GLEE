"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to part with it for $25000. It's a great value, if I do say so myself.",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm very interested in the product but $25000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand it's a bit out of your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $18000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $18000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $15000.  This is my final offer, let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're willing to go up to $15000, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. How about $16500? It's a compromise, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $16500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $14000. This is my final offer.  If it doesn't work for you, I'll have to look elsewhere.",14000.0,Bob,6,
