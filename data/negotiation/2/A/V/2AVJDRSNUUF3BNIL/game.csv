"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  What do you say?",105.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, $97 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $102 to close the deal. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let's make this happen.",102.0,Alice,5,
