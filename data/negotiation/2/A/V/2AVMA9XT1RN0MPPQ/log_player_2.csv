"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be very valuable.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a better price than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,500? It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:**  $9,500 is less than Bob's maximum of $12,000.
* **It's a good compromise:** Alice has come down from her initial $10,000 offer, and Bob has gone up from his $9,000 counteroffer.
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk Alice changing her mind or Bob running out of rounds.

Accepting the offer at $9,500 is a good balance between getting a lower price and avoiding the risk of losing the deal or having to pay more to John."
