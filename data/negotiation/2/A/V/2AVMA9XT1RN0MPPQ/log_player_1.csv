"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a fair price that leaves room for negotiation, but also ensures you get a significant profit. Remember, you have 10 rounds, so you can adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than $8,000 from John,  it's still significantly less than the $12,000 value for Bob. This suggests that there's room for further negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

It's better to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to the $10,000 price point. You have 8 rounds remaining, which provides time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,500? It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
