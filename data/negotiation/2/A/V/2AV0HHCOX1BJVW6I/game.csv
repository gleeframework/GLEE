"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering its value. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. I'm willing to negotiate, however.  How about we meet halfway and settle at $975,000?",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $975,000 is still a stretch for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $912,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.",912500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $950,000. How about $960,000? This offer reflects my desire to make a deal while ensuring a fair price for such a valuable product.",960000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $960,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $940,000? This would allow both of us to walk away with a good deal.",940000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, this is a very desirable product, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm willing to make one final concession at $945,000.  This is my absolute best offer, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",945000.0,Alice,7,
