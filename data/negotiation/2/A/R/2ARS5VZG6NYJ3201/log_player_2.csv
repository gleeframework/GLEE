Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $650,000?"", ""product_price"": 650000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $900,000 might be a bit high for you, but $650,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $800,000. This is the best I can do, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your initial offer, but $700,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $750,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down considerably from her initial offer, and while there might be a slight chance of getting the price lower, the difference is becoming less significant. At $750,000, we're saving a considerable amount compared to John's offer and avoiding the risk of further negotiation. It's a good balance between savings and deal security."
