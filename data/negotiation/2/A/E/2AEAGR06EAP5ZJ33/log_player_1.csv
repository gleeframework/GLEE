Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  He's willing to pay $800,000, so $900,000 gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below my minimum:** This gives me some space to potentially lower the price if needed.
* **It's a strong starting position:** It shows confidence in the product's worth.

I'm prepared to negotiate further if Bob rejects, but I'll also be monitoring the situation and considering selling to John if the negotiation drags on or if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired target. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can secure a price closer to $900,000.  I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
``` 

I'm offering $875,000 to Bob. This is a reasonable counteroffer:

* **It's a compromise:**  It's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **It's still above Bob's perceived value:** He values the product at $800,000, so this is a good deal for him.
* **It's closer to my desired target:** This brings me closer to my goal of selling for $900,000.

I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair offer and accept. However, I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed, and I will also continue to consider selling to John if the negotiation stalls."
