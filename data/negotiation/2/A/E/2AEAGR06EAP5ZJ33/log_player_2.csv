"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You have room to negotiate since you're willing to pay $800,000 and Alice wants at least $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $875,000 is close to your maximum budget of $800,000. Accepting this offer saves you from further negotiations and potential for the deal to fall through."
