{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a good deal for Bob:**  He's getting a $500 discount on something he values at $10,000.
* **It's good for you:**  You're earning $1,500 more than your minimum price.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob wants to counter, you have space to adjust the price slightly without compromising too much. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit, but also keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

```

While $8,500 is more than what John is offering, it's still below your minimum price. There's room for negotiation with Bob, and by rejecting his offer, you can counter with a price closer to your desired amount."

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. While it's a good starting point, I'm not quite ready to sell at that price. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This still gives you a good discount, and it's closer to what I need.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}

Bob's offer:

While $8,750 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to get. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get him to come up a bit more."
