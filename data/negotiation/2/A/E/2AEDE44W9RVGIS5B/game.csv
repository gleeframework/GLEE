"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to get closer to the market value.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $950,000 is simply too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,050,000. This is a fair offer that considers both our needs.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1,025,000, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,037,500? This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product and the price you're willing to pay.  Let's close the deal.",1037500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'd like to propose a final offer of $1,020,000. If you're willing to meet me there, I'll consider it a done deal.",1020000.0,Bob,6,
