Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum price and Bob's maximum price. This means a deal is impossible unless one of you changes your valuation or a creative solution is found. 

**The Offer**

Since a standard negotiation is impossible, you have two options:

**Option 1: Aim for John**

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, after reviewing other offers, I'm unable to accept anything less than my current asking price. I understand this may not be ideal for you, and I wish you the best in your search."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

* **Explanation:** You're essentially politely declining to negotiate with Bob. The high price ensures he'll reject, leading you to John's guaranteed offer.

**Option 2: Explore Creative Solutions (Less Likely)**

While the prompt doesn't provide space for complex negotiation, in reality, you might explore options like:

* **Payment Plans:**  Could Bob pay over time, making the immediate cost lower?
* **Added Value:**  Can you bundle the product with a service or other asset to increase its value to Bob?

**Important Note:**  Option 1 is the most logical based on the information provided. Option 2 is only viable if the prompt allows for more complex negotiations."
