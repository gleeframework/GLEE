"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to your business. I understand it's worth significantly more to you than to others. I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's fair to both of us.  Would you be interested in purchasing it for $1200000?  This allows for a substantial profit for you while still exceeding my minimum asking price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
