"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $16,000 is still a bit much for my budget.  Would you consider $12,000? I think that's a fair offer.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this product.  $12,000 is too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $14,000 for you.  This is my final offer.",14000.0,Alice,5,
