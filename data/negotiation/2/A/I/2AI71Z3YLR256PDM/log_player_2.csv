Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product.  $12,000 is too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $14,000 for you.  This is my final offer.

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $14,000.  To maximize savings, it's best to buy from John for $8,000."
