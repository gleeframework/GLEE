"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm asking for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is below Bob's maximum price, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about $8,500? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Compromise:** This offer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is starting with a significant discount from Alice's initial price.  This suggests willingness to negotiate.
* **Fair Counter:** $8,500 is halfway between Alice's $8,000 value and her $9,500 asking price, giving her some wiggle room to accept.
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains friendly and emphasizes a desire to find a mutually beneficial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:**  $9,000 is still above Bob's desired price point and closer to Alice's initial offer than his counteroffer.  There's still room to potentially get a better price.
* **Strategic Rejection:**  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to keep the pressure on Alice and potentially secure a price closer to his target. 
* **Avoiding Jhon:**  Buying from Jhon at this point would mean paying more than Alice's current offer, which doesn't make sense strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in this product and think $8,750 is a fair price.  It's a good compromise between our last offers. Let's see if we can close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Increase:**  This counteroffer moves Bob's offer up slightly from $8,500 to $8,750, showing a willingness to compromise. It's a smaller step than Alice's previous move. 
* **Fairness Emphasis:** The message stresses that this price is a compromise, making it more appealing to Alice.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message stays upbeat and focused on closing the deal. This keeps the negotiation friendly."
