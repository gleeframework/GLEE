"I appreciate the unique opportunity to own this product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I can't meet you at $600000. I'm willing to consider a compromise, though. I can sell it to you for $700000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and rarity.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $700000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $650000. Can you consider this price?",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $650000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I can sell it to you for $675000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and rarity. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target price.",675000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $675000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to make another offer, but I need to be closer to my target. I can do $620000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. Can you consider this price?",620000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $620000 is still a bit below my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I can sell it to you for $660000.

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to feel like we're not getting anywhere. I'm willing to make one final offer, and that's $600000. If you can't meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to walk away and consider buying the product from John for $1000000. I'm not willing to go any higher than this.",600000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're making a final offer, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $600000. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get at least $650000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll accept your offer.",650000.0,Alice,9,
