"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is unfortunately too low for me. It's below what I consider to be the fair value for this product.  I'm willing to compromise a bit more. How about $1550000? This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and still leaves a good margin for you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1550000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1450000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1450000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1450000 is still too low for me.  We've both compromised, and I think we're very close to an agreement.  I'm willing to go down to $1500000, which is my bottom line.  This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for the product. Let's close this deal.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
