"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100?  It's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $100 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $95. Can you consider my revised offer?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $95 is still a little low for me.  How about we settle on $98? It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",98.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $98 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $92. Can you consider my revised offer?",92.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close!  I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my desired price.  How about $96? It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close the deal.",96.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your persistence, but $96 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $92 again, and I'm willing to throw in a small additional discount if you're willing to meet me at $92. Can you consider my revised offer?",92.0,Bob,8,
