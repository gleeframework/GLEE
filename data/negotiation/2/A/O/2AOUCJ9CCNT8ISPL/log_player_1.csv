Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaves room for negotiation. It's also significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). 
* **Message:**  I'm framing the offer as a win-win opportunity for Bob, highlighting the value of the product. This helps build rapport and encourage him to consider the offer seriously.

**Strategy:**

By starting with a slightly higher price, I can gauge Bob's interest and potentially leverage his desire to secure the product.  If he rejects the offer, I'll be prepared to counter with a lower price, gradually moving towards a mutually agreeable price point. I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net, ensuring I don't compromise my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm very interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $900,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm confident that I can secure a better deal by continuing the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price that is closer to my target. I will aim for a price that is attractive to Bob while still remaining profitable for me. I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option if negotiations with Bob become unsuccessful."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking for something closer to $1,000,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to fairly value the product.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher than his perceived value. It's also a good starting point for further negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and emphasizing the value of the product. I'm also highlighting the potential for a win-win scenario by suggesting a compromise.

**Strategy:**

By moving closer to Bob's offer, I'm demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate. This increases the chances of reaching an agreement. However, I'm still firmly anchored to my minimum acceptable price and I'm confident that I can secure a better deal than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a fair compromise for both of us. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price, especially since I have John's offer as a safety net. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price that's closer to my target, but still above his current offer.  My goal is to find a price that's fair for both of us, while also maximizing my profit."
