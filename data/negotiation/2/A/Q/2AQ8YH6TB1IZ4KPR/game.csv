"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a lot to me, at least $1500000, but I believe it could be even more valuable to the right person. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $2000000. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1800000. Can we meet in the middle?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $1800000 is a good starting point, but I'm not quite there yet. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $1900000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be well worth the investment for you.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1900000. How about we meet at $1700000? I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to be comfortable with the price.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1700000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's settle on $1800000. It's a fair price, and I believe it reflects the true value of this product.  What do you say?",1800000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $1800000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to feel comfortable with the price. How about $1750000?",1750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1750000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to make one last compromise.  Let's settle on $1775000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with this deal.  What do you think?",1775000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go above $1700000. This is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to move forward with the deal.",1700000.0,Bob,8,
