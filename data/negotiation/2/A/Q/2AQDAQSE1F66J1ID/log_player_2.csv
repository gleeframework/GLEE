Alice's offer is way above your budget. You should reject and make a counteroffer."

This is your maximum budget, so you're starting with your best offer. If Alice rejects, you can still buy from John, so you have no incentive to go higher."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,250,000 is closer to your budget, it's still significantly higher than what you're willing to pay. You should continue negotiating with Alice and see if you can get closer to your target price."

You're increasing your offer a little bit, but staying below $1 million. This shows Alice you're serious about buying but still have a limit."
