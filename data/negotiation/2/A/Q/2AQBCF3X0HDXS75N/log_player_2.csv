(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $20,000 is over Bob's budget. It's worth exploring if he can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

Bob should start low. Offering $10,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial price and might incentivize her to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $17,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

Bob should continue to negotiate. $12,000 is a reasonable compromise between his initial offer and Alice's latest offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject the offer. While $16,000 is getting closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He's only used 5 rounds, and there's a good chance he can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

Bob should make a final push towards his budget limit. $14,000 is a significant compromise and may convince Alice to accept the deal. He needs to be careful as he has only 4 rounds left before he has to decide whether to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject the offer. While it's very close to his budget, he has only 3 rounds left.  He should try to get a better price. If Alice doesn't budge, he can always buy from John in the final round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

Bob should make a final counteroffer of $15,000. This is his absolute limit, and if Alice rejects, he can buy from John for the same price in the next round."
