"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $100, which is still above Bob's value for the product, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone helps keep the negotiation positive and open to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** Mentioning the ""great deal"" subtly suggests that the price is fair.
* **Setting a Deadline (implicitly):**  The ""10 rounds"" limitation is a subtle pressure point to push Bob towards a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $85. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Still Below My Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $120 value I've set for myself. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially secure a price closer to my target.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Selling to John is always an option, but rejecting Bob's counteroffer keeps the negotiation open and shows him I'm not desperate for a quick sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a little low for me.  How about $95?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll still get a good deal.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a profitable margin for myself. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains positive and friendly, encouraging further negotiation.
* **Fairness Emphasis:**  Reiterating the ""good deal"" aspect subtly pressures Bob towards acceptance.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  My counteroffer is still above Bob's maximum, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $85 is a bit low, but I'm still not comfortable with $95. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $90. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** $90 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Time is Running Out:**  With only 6 rounds left, the risk of losing the deal to John increases.
* **Potential for Counteroffers:** Even though I'm accepting, there's still a chance Bob might counteroffer again in the future.  

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, accepting Bob's offer now secures a decent profit and minimizes the risk of ending up with nothing."
