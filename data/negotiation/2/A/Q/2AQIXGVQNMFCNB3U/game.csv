"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,600,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $800,000.  Let's start with that number and see if we can find some common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. To move forward, I can offer a revised price of $1,400,000. This reflects a considerable compromise on my end while still recognizing the product's value.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that considers the value of the product and my budget. Let's meet in the middle.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. While I see you're making an effort, we need to find a solution that truly works for both of us.  To be frank, I can't accept anything less than $1,300,000.  I believe this reflects the true value of the product and offers a fair deal for both parties.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see you're committed to getting a good price, and I respect that. I can go up to $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value we're both bringing to the table. Let's try to close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
