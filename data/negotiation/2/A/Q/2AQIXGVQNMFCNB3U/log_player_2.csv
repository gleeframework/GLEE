Alice's offer is way above your budget.  It's best to start negotiating and see if you can get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,600,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $800,000.  Let's start with that number and see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. To move forward, I can offer a revised price of $1,400,000. This reflects a considerable compromise on my end while still recognizing the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's a step in the right direction, it's still significantly over my budget. I'll counter with a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that considers the value of the product and my budget. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. While I see you're making an effort, we need to find a solution that truly works for both of us.  To be frank, I can't accept anything less than $1,300,000.  I believe this reflects the true value of the product and offers a fair deal for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

Alice's offer is still too high, although it's getting closer. I'm going to counter with a lower offer to try to reach a mutually acceptable price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I see you're committed to getting a good price, and I respect that. I can go up to $1,100,000.
