"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit lower than my minimum, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. I'm also including a friendly message to build rapport and encourage a response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer but $95 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm sticking with a price that's still above my minimum but lower than my initial offer. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product.  I'm also keeping the message friendly to maintain a positive relationship."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. Considering my budget constraints, would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round. I have several rounds left, and I'm not desperate to sell right now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $100 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $105. This is a great opportunity to get a valuable product at a fair price. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm sticking with a price that's still above my minimum but lower than my initial offer. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product.  I'm also keeping the message friendly to maintain a positive relationship."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility. I'll counter with $100, as I believe that's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round. I have several rounds left, and I'm not desperate to sell right now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a bit more. How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? This seems like a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 102.5}
```

I'm offering a small increase to try and get Bob closer to my minimum price. I'm also framing it as a ""split the difference"" compromise, which can make it seem more reasonable to Bob. I'm hoping that this final push will be enough to seal the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad we're finding common ground. I'll counter with $100 again, as I believe that's a fair price given the value of the product. Let's see if we can finalize this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where the negotiation with Bob is becoming tedious and I'm not confident I can get a higher price.  John has offered a price that meets my minimum, and I'd rather sell to him at that price than continue to haggle with Bob. It's better to secure the sale than risk losing both potential buyers."
