"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $95?",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer but $95 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product. Let me know if you're interested.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. Considering my budget constraints, would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but $100 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $105. This is a great opportunity to get a valuable product at a fair price. Let me know if you're interested.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility. I'll counter with $100, as I believe that's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if we can agree on this.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a bit more. How about we split the difference and go with $102.50? This seems like a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you think?",102.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm glad we're finding common ground. I'll counter with $100 again, as I believe that's a fair price given the value of the product. Let's see if we can finalize this.",100.0,Bob,8,
