"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the discount, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer you $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price that still allows you to make a profit. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $10,500. Considering the product's value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $11,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. This is a fair price that would allow you to make a profit, and it's closer to my budget. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I can still make a decent profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm offering you a counteroffer of $11,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
