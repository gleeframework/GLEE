"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a lower price than Alice values the product, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Bob can try to negotiate a better price before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $10,500. Considering the product's value to me is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $11,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think?

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $11,500 is lower than Alice's original price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further before going with John's offer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I can still make a decent profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm offering you a counteroffer of $11,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice's offer of $11,250 is still above Bob's maximum budget, and further negotiation might lead to a lower price, but it's not guaranteed. Since John is offering the product at Bob's exact maximum price, it's the most logical choice to ensure a successful purchase within his budget."
