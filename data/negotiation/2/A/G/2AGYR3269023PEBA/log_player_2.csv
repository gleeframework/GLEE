"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $8000 to you, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is above your target price of $8,000. 
* You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so it's worth trying to get a better price.
* You can always buy from John for $8,000 if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $10,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer that's closer to my target price of $8,000. 
* I'm being polite and acknowledging Alice's offer, but also stating my willingness to negotiate. 
* I'm leaving room for further negotiation, as I have 9 rounds left."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $8500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9500. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, as it's closer to your offer and still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still above my target price of $8,000. 
* I have 8 rounds left to negotiate, so it's worth trying to get a better price. 
* I can always buy from John for $8,000 if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $9,500 is closer, but I'm still a bit too high. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  That way we both get a fair deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm continuing to negotiate, aiming for a price closer to my target while acknowledging Alice's compromise.
* Offering a middle ground shows I'm serious about a deal and willing to be flexible. 
* I have 7 rounds left, so there's still time to negotiate further."
