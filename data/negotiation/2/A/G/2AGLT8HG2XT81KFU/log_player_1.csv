{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe will be a great asset to you. I'm offering it to you for $18,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product. Let me know if you're open to negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I will reject Bob's offer. $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I will try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $15,000 for the product.  This represents a substantial discount from my initial price.  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $15000 is still too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $10000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your initial asking price, and it allows me to stay within my budget. I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my target.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 isn't quite there for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $12,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to ensure I get a reasonable return on this valuable product.  I'm confident you'll find this price agreeable. "", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12500 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11000.  This is a fair compromise, and it ensures we both get a good deal. Let's finalize this and move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $11,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit. I've already reached the halfway point in the negotiations, and there's no guarantee Bob will agree to a higher price in the remaining rounds. I'm confident that selling to John for $12,000 is the best option to maximize my earnings."
