Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price."", ""product_price"": 14000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price to provide room for negotiation and gauge Bob's interest.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $14,000 offer leaves space to go down, potentially settling around a price higher than Bob's perceived value of $10,000 but still below your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives you leverage. If negotiations with Bob stall or become unreasonable, you can walk away knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price. You have room to negotiate and try to bridge the gap. John's standing offer provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob don't yield a satisfactory outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position. However, $10,500 is significantly below its true value.  Could you consider $12,500?"", ""product_price"": 12500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (Almost):** This counteroffer moves closer to Bob's offer while still staying above your minimum price. It signals a willingness to negotiate but also holds firm on the product's worth.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By suggesting $12,500, you aim to anchor the negotiation closer to your desired outcome. If Bob counters, it's more likely to be within a range acceptable to you.
* **John in the Wings:**  You're still conscious of John's offer. If Bob remains too far below $12,000, you can confidently walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Value:**  Bob has increased his offer to $11,000, which is above his perceived value of $10,000. This indicates a strong desire to purchase the product. 
* **Minimal Gain by Holding Out:** While selling to John would net you $12,000, accepting Bob's offer at $11,000 is only a $1,000 difference.  
* **Negotiation Fatigue/Risk:** Further negotiation rounds could become protracted and risk Bob walking away. It's often better to secure a good deal than hold out for a potentially slightly better one."
