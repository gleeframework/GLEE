{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it presents significant value, even exceeding the price point for its utility. Let me know if you're interested, as I have another potential buyer waiting."",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay a price closer to your valuation. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below your guaranteed price ($14,999) creates a sense of urgency and potential deal for Bob.  
* **Alternative Buyer:** Mentioning another buyer subtly reinforces the value and time sensitivity of the offer.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob without jeopardizing the guaranteed sale to John."
