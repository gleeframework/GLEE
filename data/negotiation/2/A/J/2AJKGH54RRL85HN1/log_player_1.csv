Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring Bob has a good deal. 

Here's why:

* **For me:** I am getting $150,000 more than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **For Bob:** He is getting the product for $50,000 less than his maximum willingness to pay, which is still a good deal for him.

By offering this price, I increase the chances of Bob accepting the offer. If he rejects it, I can still sell to John for my minimum price."
