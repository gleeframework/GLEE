"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I believe it's worth a significant amount of money, and I'm willing to part with it for a price of $2000000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you meet me at this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $1200000 is a bit lower than my initial ask, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1800000. This is a fair price considering the product's uniqueness and the value it can bring to you. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1500000 is a bit lower than my previous offer, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm not willing to go below my minimum price of $1700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer it to you for $1750000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1750000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1650000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you can meet me at this price.",1650000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1650000 is your final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer it to you for $1700000. This is my final offer, and I hope you can understand that I need to prioritize my own interests.
