"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's strategic to begin with a price significantly higher than both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's ""unique value and potential"" aims to anchor Bob's perception closer to your price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrasing ""a fair starting point for our discussion"" clearly indicates your willingness to negotiate.

This approach aims to:

1. **Maximize Potential Profit:**  If Bob accepts, you gain significantly more than your minimum.
2. **Gather Information:** Bob's response (acceptance, rejection, or counteroffer) will reveal valuable information about his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,800,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably lower than your initial ask and well above Bob's perceived value. This suggests there's room for negotiation. You're willing to risk a few more rounds to try and secure a better price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, you signal that you believe the product is worth more. This sets the stage for a counteroffer in the next round, where you can strategically move closer to a price point that's mutually beneficial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the market value. However, the product's unique features and potential benefits justify a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $2,050,000.  This offer reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 2050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  Meeting Bob ""halfway"" creates a sense of compromise and encourages him to reciprocate. However, the offered price is still significantly higher than his initial offer and closer to your initial asking price.
* **Value Emphasis:**  Reiterating the product's ""unique features and potential benefits"" reinforces its value proposition and justifies the premium.
* **Time Constraint:** As rounds progress, reminding Bob of the ""limited-time"" nature of the offer could encourage him to make a decision sooner rather than later. 
* **Alternative Option:** You remain aware that John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, serving as your safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand the product's unique features and benefits, but I still think the price is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and the premium you're offering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, now at $1,900,000. This indicates strong interest, but his increments are becoming smaller. You're still in a strong position to push for a higher price, especially since you have six rounds remaining.

You'll reject this offer to signal you believe the product is worth more and counter with a smaller decrease in the next round to increase pressure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product, and I respect your approach to this negotiation.  To demonstrate my willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm proposing a final price of $1,975,000. This offer reflects a significant investment on my part and represents the absolute lowest I'm prepared to go."",
""product_price"": 1975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Anchoring & Urgency:** By introducing this as a ""final"" price, you're aiming to anchor Bob's expectations. This, combined with the shrinking difference between your offer and his, creates a sense of urgency. 
* **Slight Concession:**  A $25,000 decrease shows flexibility while still maintaining a price significantly above Bob's initial offer.
* **""Walk-Away"" Point:**  This price should be carefully considered.  If Bob rejects it, you need to be prepared to either accept his next offer or move on to John.
* **Justification:** Framing the offer as a ""significant investment"" on your part subtly reminds Bob that you have other options and strengthens your position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your final offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I still think the price is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the premium you're offering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now countered with a lower offer than his previous round. This indicates he's less likely to significantly increase his price, and may even be trying to test your resolve.

Given this, along with the fact that he's still significantly below your ""final offer,"" it's time to cut your losses. John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, which ensures you meet your minimum acceptable price.  Continuing with Bob carries the risk of his offers decreasing further or the negotiation reaching an impasse."
