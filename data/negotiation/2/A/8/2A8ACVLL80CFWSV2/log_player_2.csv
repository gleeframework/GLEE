Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making a counter offer. While your valuation is understandable, the product's true value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,300,000.  This still leaves a considerable margin for you to realize a significant return on this investment.
