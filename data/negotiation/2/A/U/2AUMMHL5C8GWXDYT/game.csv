"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $950,000 for the product.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find common ground. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. My counteroffer is $925,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the profit I need to make.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While I value the product, $925,000 is still a bit above my target.  I'm willing to go to $875,000.  Let's try to find a solution that benefits us both.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we're getting closer, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000. This is my final offer, as I don't want to go any lower. I believe this price is fair and reasonable considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $885,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. If you're not willing to consider this, I may have to look at other options.",885000.0,Bob,6,
