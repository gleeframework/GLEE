This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me is $800,000, and I want to make sure I'm not losing out on the deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. I can see you're serious about the product. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think about other opportunities, and I don't want to miss out on a better deal. Can you meet me at this price?",950000.0,Alice,5,
