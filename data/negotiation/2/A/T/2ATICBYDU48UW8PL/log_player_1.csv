Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given its value to you at $1,000,000, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This would still allow you a healthy profit while giving me a good deal.
