"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I understand your perspective, $800,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product and its potential return for your business. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a fair offer considering the unique benefits it offers.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but that's still a bit too high for me. I could go up to $900,000. I believe that's a fair offer considering the market value.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price, but I need to be upfront â€“ offers below $1,500,000 simply aren't feasible.  That said, I'm invested in making this work. How about we meet halfway between your last offer and mine at $1,400,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we need to find a compromise. How about we split the difference between your offer and my last one? I propose $1,150,000.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're definitely getting the hang of this negotiation! I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,150,000 is tempting, I'm aiming for something closer to my previous offer. Would you consider $1,300,000? That would bridge the gap significantly.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close! I appreciate your movement. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1225000.0,Bob,8,
