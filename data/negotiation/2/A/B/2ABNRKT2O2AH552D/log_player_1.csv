{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested in this product, but $9,000 just isn't enough for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,500?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $9,750 isn't quite getting me there. Let's meet halfway between our last offers at $10,125.

Bob is getting really stubborn, and we're running out of rounds.  I'm not sure if I can get a better price from him, so I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's better than risking getting nothing from Bob."
