Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at a special price of $145. I believe it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible, while still ensuring a profit above our minimum ($150).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $145 creates a sense of urgency (""limited time,"" ""special price"") and positions it as a potential bargain for Bob. 
* **Alternative Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, we have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, ensuring we don't lose out.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible profit while accounting for the potential of Bob rejecting the offer."
