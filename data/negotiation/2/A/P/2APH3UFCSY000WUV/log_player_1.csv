""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Potential Gain:** Since Bob values the product at $10,000, there's a possibility he might be willing to pay more, especially if he believes it's a unique opportunity. 
* **Fallback Option:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, so there's no risk of getting less than your minimum.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting high allows room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can potentially settle closer to your desired price. 

By starting with a higher offer, Alice maximizes her potential profit while still having the security of a guaranteed sale at her minimum price."
