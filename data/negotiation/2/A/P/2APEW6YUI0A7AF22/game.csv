"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. Let's get started with a fair offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer. This product is interesting to me, but that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more than $800,000. I can offer it to you for $950,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  While $950,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price point closer to $900,000. Would you be willing to consider $880,000?",880000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're making progress, but I'm still a bit far from where I need to be. I can see that you're willing to pay $880,000, but I'm not ready to meet you there just yet. I'll try to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $880,000. How about $915,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",915000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to meet you closer. How about $895,000?",895000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I'm getting closer to your price, but I still need to make a bit more. I'm willing to compromise at $920,000. I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",920000.0,Alice,7,
