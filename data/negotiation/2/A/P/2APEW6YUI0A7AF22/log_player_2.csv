Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more than $800,000. I can offer it to you for $950,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're making progress, but I'm still a bit far from where I need to be. I can see that you're willing to pay $880,000, but I'm not ready to meet you there just yet. I'll try to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $880,000. How about $915,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I'm getting closer to your price, but I still need to make a bit more. I'm willing to compromise at $920,000. I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

It's clear Alice is very attached to a price above $900,000.  We are getting close to our walk-away point with John, and continuing to negotiate with Alice is unlikely to result in significant savings. Buying from John for $1,000,000 guarantees we stay within our budget."
