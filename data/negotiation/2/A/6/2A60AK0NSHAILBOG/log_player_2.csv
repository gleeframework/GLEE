"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $20,000 is above Bob's maximum budget, and he can get the product for $15,000 from John.  There's no reason to accept this offer.  It makes more sense to try and negotiate with Alice, and if that fails,  he can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I really appreciate it. However, $20,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $17,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $17,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $18,500 is closer to his budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay. Since he can get the product from John for $15,000, it makes sense to keep negotiating with Alice and try to get a lower price. There's still room for compromise, and he can always walk away and buy from John if he has to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $16,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 16500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $16,500 is close, but I can't go that low.  My final offer is $17,500.  This is a great price for a product this valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $17,500 is closer to his budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay.  He can get the product from John for $15,000, so it makes sense to continue negotiating with Alice and see if he can get a lower price. He has a few rounds left, and there's still room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you have a bottom line, and I appreciate you working with me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to pay $17,000, which is right in the middle of our last two offers.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 17000}
