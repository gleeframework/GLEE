"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, but also takes into account my budget constraints. What are your thoughts on this revised offer?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the unique benefits this product offers you. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,225,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
