"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but  $1,800,000 is not even close to what I'm willing to pay. How about we come down significantly, say to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we consider $1,450,000? This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $1,450,000 is still too high. While I believe this product has value, I have a budget in mind.  Would you consider $950,000?  That's a fair offer.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation.  I'm seeing a gap between our positions, but I'm confident we can bridge it.  To demonstrate my willingness to move towards a deal, I propose $1,300,000. This reflects a significant adjustment on my part and keeps us moving in the right direction.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but the gap is still pretty wide for me. To be frank, I have a firm budget for this purchase, and I need to stay within it. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 - that's my final offer. It's a fair price, and it allows me to stay within my constraints. What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty and the fact you've moved closer to my valuation.  I've considered your final offer carefully. To be transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price. However, I value the rapport we've built, and I'm motivated to close this deal with you.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,7,
