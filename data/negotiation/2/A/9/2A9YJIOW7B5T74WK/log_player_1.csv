Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm willing to make a deal at $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you want to try and get more from Bob if possible.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting with $950,000 leaves room for negotiation (if Bob tries to haggle) while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" reinforces that the price is justified."
