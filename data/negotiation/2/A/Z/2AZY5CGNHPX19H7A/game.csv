"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, the price point is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  Could you consider $875,000? This feels like a more reasonable compromise.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $875,000 is still a bit more than I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
