# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $10,000 is still less than I hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $12,000 as my final offer. This is a significant discount, and I need to ensure it aligns with the value I'm offering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
