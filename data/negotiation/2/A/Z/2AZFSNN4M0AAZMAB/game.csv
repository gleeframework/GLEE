"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $16,000 is way too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $8,000. Let's start there.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  Let's find a middle ground. How about we agree on $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $14,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but that's my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $10,000 is still less than I hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $12,000 as my final offer. This is a significant discount, and I need to ensure it aligns with the value I'm offering.",12000.0,Alice,5,
