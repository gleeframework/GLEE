"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. Given my research and the product's current market value, I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value we both see in this opportunity.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is too low for me to consider. This product has significant potential beyond what the current market reflects. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  I believe this price is a more accurate reflection of its value and leaves room for us both to benefit.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, and I'm willing to pay a fair price. However, $1,800,000 is still out of my range. I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000, which reflects the value I see in the product and represents a significant investment for me. I'm confident this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
