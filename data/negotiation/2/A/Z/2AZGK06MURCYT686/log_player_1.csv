Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for a limited time at $200. I think you'll find it's a great deal for its value."", ""product_price"": 200} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning a ""limited time"" and hinting at the ""value,"" I'm creating a sense of urgency and implying the price is justified, even without explicitly stating why. 

My strategy is to slowly lower the price during negotiation, aiming to settle somewhere above $150. If Bob makes a reasonable counteroffer, I might accept. However, if negotiations stall or go below a profitable point, I'll switch to John, ensuring my minimum profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $150 for it. Would you be able to accommodate this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer matches my absolute minimum acceptable price. While I could try negotiating further, there's no guarantee I can get him higher, and I risk him lowering his offer or walking away. John offers a guaranteed $150, ensuring I don't lose out on any potential profit.  It's a better business decision to take the guaranteed profit than to risk losing the sale or engaging in lengthy negotiations."
