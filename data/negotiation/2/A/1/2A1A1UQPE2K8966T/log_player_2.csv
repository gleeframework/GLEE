"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a good price, it's still above the product's value to Alice ($800,000) and leaves room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate.  It's still a good deal for Alice, as it's above her valuation of the product, but it also leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still a bit high, and there's still room for negotiation. While Bob could accept and get a better price than John's offer, there's a chance he can push Alice lower.  Rejecting the offer gives him more rounds to potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, but it's still below Alice's last offer and closer to his desired price.  This demonstrates his willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation. It's better for Bob to reject this offer and try to get a lower price, especially since he has a good alternative with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again slightly increasing his offer, but still below Alice's last offer.  This demonstrates his willingness to compromise while continuing to push for a better price.  This could be the final round where Bob can secure a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a better price than John's offer, Bob has already shown his willingness to negotiate and is still within his desired price range. There are only 3 rounds remaining, and there's a chance Bob can secure a lower price by continuing to negotiate. It's a calculated risk, but the potential savings are worth it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now making a counteroffer that is closer to Alice's last offer. This shows his willingness to compromise, but also that he's still trying to get a better price. It is a risky move as there are only two rounds left, but it might be enough to convince Alice to accept. It's a gamble, but Bob is pushing for a deal that is good for him."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round of negotiations with Alice. While Bob could try to get a lower price by making another counteroffer, it's a risky move with only one round remaining. Accepting Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is a good deal for Bob, as it's still below his maximum budget of $1,200,000 and significantly better than buying from John."
