"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Confidence:**  My message conveys confidence in the product's value, aiming to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal if he accepts.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** I'm aware that Bob might not be willing to pay $110, but this sets the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation. 

**Important Note:** While I'm aiming for the best price, I also want to keep the deal alive.  I'll be ready to adjust my price based on Bob's response in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum value:** While Bob's offer is better than his initial rejection, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can explore the possibility of a higher price in the next round.
* **Minimizing risk:**  While I could sell to John for $100, I'm not yet desperate.  I want to see if I can get closer to my target price with Bob.  

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to $100 to see if we can reach a compromise.  I'll need to be careful not to push Bob away, but I'm confident that I can find a price that's acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, it's still a bit too low for me.  How about $95?  I'm willing to be flexible, but I really need to get at least that much for this product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his offer.
* **Emphasize Value:** My message reiterates that I'm still motivated to sell to Bob, but also emphasizes the value of the product.
* **Strong but not aggressive:** My message is firm but not overly aggressive, hoping to avoid alienating Bob further.

**Next Steps:**

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be attractive enough for Bob to consider. If he rejects it, I'll have to make a decision about whether to keep negotiating or sell to John.  But I'm confident that a deal with Bob is still possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum Value:** Bob's offer of $85 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  
* **Limited Negotiation Room:**  We've already gone through a few rounds, and Bob's offers haven't come close to my minimum. It seems unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  By selling to John, I can secure my minimum price and avoid further negotiation with Bob, which could potentially lead to a lower price or a deal falling through entirely.  

**Next Steps:**

Selling to John ensures a guaranteed profit and avoids the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob that might not lead to a satisfactory outcome."
