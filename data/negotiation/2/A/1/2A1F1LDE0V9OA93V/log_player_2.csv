"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's something that's worth at least $10000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

* **You're still getting a good deal:**  The product is worth $15,000 to you, and you're getting it for $12,000."
