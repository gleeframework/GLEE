"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

*  You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000.
* Alice is offering the product for $1,500,000. 
* John is also willing to sell the product for $1,500,000.

Since both Alice and John offer the same price, you can reject Alice's offer and buy from John. This doesn't save you money, but it gives you the option to potentially negotiate a lower price with John in the future."
