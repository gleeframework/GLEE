"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product at a price of $9,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this offer reflects that. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $10,000, and Alice is willing to sell for $8,000. There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the initial offer gives you a chance to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm hoping for a price closer to $9,000. I'm really interested in the product and I believe this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? This is a very competitive price for a product of this value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your preferred price.  At $9,250, you're still getting a decent deal, and it's only $250 more than your last counteroffer.  It's likely that further negotiation might not result in a significantly better price, and you risk losing the deal altogether.  It's better to secure the product at this price than risk having to buy from John at a higher price."
