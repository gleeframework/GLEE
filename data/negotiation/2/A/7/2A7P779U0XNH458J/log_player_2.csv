"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $13000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $13,000 is better than John's offer of $15,000.
* However, you can likely get a better price by counteroffering. You know the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging the value to me. I'm interested, but I'm aiming to stay within a budget of $12,500. Would you be willing to come down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13250. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $13,250 is a fair compromise and is still a better price than buying from John for $15,000. 
* While you could continue negotiating, there's a good chance Alice will hold firm at this price since it's closer to her desired value.  
* Accepting the offer saves you $1,750 compared to John's offer."
