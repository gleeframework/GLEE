"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you're interested in. My asking price is $10,000, which I believe is fair given its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a better deal than Alice's original asking price of $12,000, Bob can still aim for a lower price.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible. While I'm interested in the product, $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $8,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $8,500 is tempting, I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the product's value.  How about $9,500?  This still leaves some room for negotiation, but it gets us closer to finding a mutually agreeable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to his limit of $8,000. While Alice's offer of $9,500 is better than her previous offer, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay.  He should reject the offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $9,500 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a bit too high. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $9,000? This is a fair price, and it would allow us to close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 9000}
