Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you're interested in. My asking price is $10,000, which I believe is fair given its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible. While I'm interested in the product, $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $8,500. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $8,500 is still too low for me. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $8,500 is tempting, I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the product's value.  How about $9,500?  This still leaves some room for negotiation, but it gets us closer to finding a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $9,500 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a bit too high. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $9,000? This is a fair price, and it would allow us to close the deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm accepting Bob's offer. While $9,000 isn't my ideal price, it's getting closer to my desired value and I want to avoid further negotiation. The risk of losing the deal to another buyer is not worth pushing for a higher price at this point."
