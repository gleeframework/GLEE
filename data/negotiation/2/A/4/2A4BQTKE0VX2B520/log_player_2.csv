# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product for a price of $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price given its value to you. Let's discuss! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,750,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for this product, given its value to me.  Let's work towards a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $1,600,000. This price is still fair considering its value to you, and I believe it allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's find common ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial price, it's still above Bob's budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice will go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. This is a fair price for the value I see in the product, and it's the highest I can offer. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  While $1,450,000 is closer,  it's still a bit below what I need.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,550,000. This would allow us both to walk away with a good outcome.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still $50,000 over his limit. Bob should continue to negotiate for a lower price, as he has a few more rounds to try.  If he rejects, he can counteroffer closer to John's price and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $1,550,000 is still slightly outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,525,000. This is a fair price given the value of the product, and it's very close to my limit. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1525000}
