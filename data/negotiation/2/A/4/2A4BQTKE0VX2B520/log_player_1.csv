Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,750,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for this product, given its value to me.  Let's work towards a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal quickly, I'm confident I can secure a better price. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired amount in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $1,600,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. This is a fair price for the value I see in the product, and it's the highest I can offer. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  While $1,450,000 is closer,  it's still a bit below what I need.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,550,000. This would allow us both to walk away with a good outcome.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1550000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $1,550,000 is still slightly outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,525,000. This is a fair price given the value of the product, and it's very close to my limit. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,525,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,525,000 is very close to my desired price. It's only $25,000 below my minimum, and I'm confident that further negotiation might not yield a significantly higher price. Accepting this offer would guarantee a sale and a good profit."
