"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product for a price of $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price given its value to you. Let's discuss!",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,750,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for this product, given its value to me.  Let's work towards a mutually agreeable price.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $1,600,000. This price is still fair considering its value to you, and I believe it allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's find common ground here.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. This is a fair price for the value I see in the product, and it's the highest I can offer. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  While $1,450,000 is closer,  it's still a bit below what I need.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,550,000. This would allow us both to walk away with a good outcome.  What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $1,550,000 is still slightly outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,525,000. This is a fair price given the value of the product, and it's very close to my limit. Let's finalize this deal.",1525000.0,Bob,6,
