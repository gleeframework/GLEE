"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $13,500.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is a decent price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  He has a clear upper limit of $15,000, so there's room to counter and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $12,000? "", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! While $12,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a little to $11,500.  This reflects the value of the product and also leaves some room for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,500, which is significantly closer to Bob's target price of $10,000.  While he could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting the counteroffer or Bob having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential for a small additional saving.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without risking further negotiation."
