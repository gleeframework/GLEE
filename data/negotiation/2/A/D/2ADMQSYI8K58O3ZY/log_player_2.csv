"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. It's worth at least $800000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000.  This is a significant opportunity, and I believe it has the potential to generate substantial returns for your business. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'll reject Alice's offer. I can get the same product from John for $1,200,000, so paying $900,000 to Alice would save me $300,000.
