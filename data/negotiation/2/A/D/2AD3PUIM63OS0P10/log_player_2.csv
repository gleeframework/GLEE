"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this unique product for $1,000,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe holds immense potential for you. This is a price that reflects its true worth and ensures a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Since you can buy the product for $1,000,000 from John, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer at the same price. Rejecting her offer opens the possibility of a counter-offer from Alice at a lower price."
