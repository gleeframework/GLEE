"Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I believe will be a valuable asset to your business.  I'm asking $1500000 for it, which is a fair price considering its unique capabilities and potential.  What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me at this point. Considering the potential of this product, I'd be willing to pay $1200000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to discussing that price further.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1200000 is unfortunately below what I can accept at this time. However, I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product offers.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1350000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable right now.  I'm prepared to pay $1250000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering the value and our discussions.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
