Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is significantly less than what I'm willing to part with. How about we meet in the middle - would $110 work for you?"", ""product_price"": 110}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $110 is still a bit much for me. Could we settle on something around $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing some movement here, but that price is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference again and call it $90?  This would save you quite a bit from my original offer."", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $90 is closer, but I'm trying to keep it under $80. Would you be willing to do $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has consistently shown he's unwilling to meet a price that's acceptable to you. He's unlikely to go above $80, and you've already gone as low as $90.  It's time to cut your losses and take the guaranteed $100 from John."
