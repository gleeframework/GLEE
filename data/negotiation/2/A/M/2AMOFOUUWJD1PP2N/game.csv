"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is significantly less than what I'm willing to part with. How about we meet in the middle - would $110 work for you?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $110 is still a bit much for me. Could we settle on something around $70?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing some movement here, but that price is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference again and call it $90?  This would save you quite a bit from my original offer.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $90 is closer, but I'm trying to keep it under $80. Would you be willing to do $75?",75.0,Bob,6,
