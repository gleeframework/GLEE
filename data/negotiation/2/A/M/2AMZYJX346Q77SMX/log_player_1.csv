"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept it on the first round. This allows me to gauge his interest and leave room for negotiation. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm not in a rush. I'll see if I can get a better price by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering $9,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product above his initial offer.  Let's see if he bites."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is a good price and only $500 less than my ideal.  Given that there are only 6 rounds left, I'm not confident I can get a better price. Accepting this offer is the best move."
