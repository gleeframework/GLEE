"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $8,000. I believe this is a fair deal and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message tries to persuade you, you know you have a better option. You can get the product for $8,000 from John, which is your maximum price point.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to pursue this better deal."
