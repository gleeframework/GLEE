"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  It's worth $1,000,000 to her, and she's already asking for $1,200,000. There's room for negotiation, so I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to pay $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, but I'm still within my budget.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying but am also looking for a good deal. It's a strong starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe the product's value to you is higher than that, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay. While she's moved closer,  $1,300,000 is still too far from my initial counteroffer of $950,000. I'll reject and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000, which is a significant increase from my initial counteroffer and leaves room for us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer slightly to show that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still firmly within my budget.  The ""split the difference"" approach often helps in negotiations, and I'm hoping this will encourage Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,100,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe the product's value to you is closer to this price, and I'm willing to give you a slight discount from my initial offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still too high. While she has come down from her initial offer, $1,250,000 is still more than what I'm comfortable paying.  I'll continue to negotiate and try to get the price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,250,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is a significant increase from my last offer, and I hope we can finally find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer again, but still keeping it well below Alice's offer.  I'm showing that I'm serious about making a deal but also that I won't overpay.  This is a good opportunity to see if Alice is willing to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,150,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000, but I'm willing to make a slight concession. How about we meet at $1,220,000? This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a good compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her offer, $1,220,000 is still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm getting closer to my target, but I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll reject and continue negotiating to push for a price closer to $1,150,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a compromise, but $1,220,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,180,000. This is a significant increase from my last offer, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to have a successful transaction. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1180000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer again, but only slightly. I'm showing Alice that I'm serious about buying and am close to meeting her price, but still trying to get the best deal possible. This is likely to be my final offer before considering buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're close to reaching a deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,250,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $1,200,000? This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a good compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her previous offer, but $1,200,000 is still higher than what I'm comfortable paying.  We're close to a deal, but I have one more round left, and I'm not ready to give up on trying to get a lower price.  I'll make one last counteroffer, hoping that Alice will finally accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  I'm very close to my budget, but I can go up to $1,190,000.  This is a final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider my other options."", ""product_price"": 1190000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final counteroffer. I've raised my price slightly to show that I'm serious about making a deal but also that I'm not willing to go any higher.  This puts the pressure on Alice to make a decision. If she rejects, I'll move on to John."
