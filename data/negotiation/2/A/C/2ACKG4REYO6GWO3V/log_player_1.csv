Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My minimum:** I value the product at $15,000.
* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $10,000.
* **My offer:**  I'm offering the product for $14,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum, but still above Bob's value.

**Why this strategy:**

* **Potential for profit:** This gives me a good chance of getting a sale close to my desired price.
* **Negotiation room:** It leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers, allowing me to potentially get closer to my minimum.
* **Safety net:**  I have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer:**  Bob's offer is below my minimum value ($15,000) and significantly lower than my initial offer.
* **My goal:** I want to maximize my profit. 
* **Next steps:** While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price. 

**Why reject and counteroffer:**

* **Potential for higher price:** I believe there's room to negotiate a price closer to my minimum.
* **Risk assessment:** While I have the option to sell to John, it's still worth trying to get a better price from Bob. 
* **Negotiation tactic:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows that I'm determined to get a better price and sets the stage for further negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My goal:** My goal is to maximize my profit while still potentially securing a deal with Bob.
* **Previous offers:** My initial offer was $14,000 and Bob countered with $12,000.
* **Counteroffer:**  I'm offering a price of $13,000, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility while still pushing for a better price.

**Why this counteroffer:**

* **Midpoint compromise:** This counteroffer is closer to my initial offer, but it still allows for potential for negotiation. 
* **Increased chance of acceptance:** By being willing to compromise, I increase the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer. 
* **Staying firm:** I'm not willing to go lower than $13,000, as that would be below my minimum value."
