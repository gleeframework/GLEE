"Thanks for the offer, Alice! That product looks great, but $110 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $90?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $100. It's a great compromise, considering its value to you is $120. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in!",100.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle at $95? That seems like a fair deal to me.",95.0,Bob,4,

"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to accept $95 just yet. I can offer you a slight adjustment to $98. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth it. What do you think?",98.0,Alice,5,
