"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you are willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product and Alice is offering it at exactly your maximum price, there's no incentive to accept her offer. You can get the product from John for the same price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you keep your options open and might even be able to negotiate a lower price with John."
