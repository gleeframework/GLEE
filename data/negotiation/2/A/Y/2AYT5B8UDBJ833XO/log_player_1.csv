Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize my profit.  I'll adjust based on Bob's response and the potential risk of losing him to another buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum.  I'll counteroffer to try and get a better price, but I'll keep John's offer in mind as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm going to stick to my minimum price of $1,200,000.  This is my floor, and I'm not willing to go lower than that.  I'm hoping Bob sees the value in my product and is willing to meet me at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and I'm not sure if he'll ever meet my price.  To avoid further negotiation and risk losing him completely, I'm going to sell to John.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum and ensures I get a guaranteed sale."
