"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity to get a deal on a product that's worth $1,500,000 to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is interesting, but I'm not quite ready to commit to your price. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in the product.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to negotiate a fair price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,300,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I believe you'll see the value in the product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000.  This is a fair price that allows for a healthy profit for you while still being a great deal for me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value the product brings. I'm not willing to go any lower, but I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
