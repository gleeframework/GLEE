"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer! While I agree the product is valuable,  $9,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price of $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. Considering your counteroffer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,500. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a touch high. How about $7,500? I think that's a fair offer that benefits us both.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, and I'm willing to make another concession. Considering your offer of $7,500, I'm willing to meet you at $8,000. It's the lowest price I'm comfortable with, but I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.",8000.0,Alice,5,
