Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, and I'm willing to make another concession. Considering your offer of $7,500, I'm willing to meet you at $8,000. It's the lowest price I'm comfortable with, but I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.

Alice has come down to her lowest price, which is a significant savings compared to John's offer. It's unlikely she'll go any lower, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal."
