{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum value ($150). This leaves room for negotiation and increases the chances of a successful sale.
* **Leaving room for counter-offers:** A price of $130 allows for potential counter-offers from Bob without me dropping below my minimum. 
* **Positive message:**  A friendly and optimistic message encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

This strategy aims to secure a good price while keeping the negotiation open and encouraging Bob to make a counter-offer. If Bob rejects the offer, I will continue the negotiation by considering his counter-offer and adjusting my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $100 is lower than my minimum value of $150, so accepting would result in a loss.
* **Potential for better price:** I can still negotiate with Bob and potentially reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **John's offer as backup:**  John's offer provides a safety net, ensuring I won't settle for a price I'm uncomfortable with.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my position and have the opportunity to improve the deal through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115? I'm confident you'll still get a great value at that price. "", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:**  The counteroffer of $115 represents a compromise, showing flexibility while staying above my minimum value.
* **Positive and encouraging message:** The message emphasizes a willingness to negotiate and aims to maintain a positive rapport with Bob.
* **Strategic pricing:**  $115 is a halfway point between my initial offer and Bob's counter-offer,  creating a clear midpoint for negotiation. 

This counteroffer aims to find common ground with Bob while ensuring I don't drop below my minimum price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $110? That's as low as I'm comfortable going. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  While $110 is still below my preferred price, it's very close to my minimum of $150. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject this offer, Bob might walk away, and there's no guarantee I can get a higher price in the next round. 
* **John's offer as a backup:**  Although John is offering more, I can still secure a decent profit by accepting Bob's offer.

Taking this offer minimizes the risk of losing the sale completely and still allows me to gain a respectable profit."
