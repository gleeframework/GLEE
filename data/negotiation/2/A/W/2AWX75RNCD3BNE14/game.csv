"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest!  While $60 is a bit low for me, I appreciate your offer.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $90?  That's still a great price for this amazing product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, $90 is closer but I'm on a bit of a budget.  Would you do $75? That's the highest I can go.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer of $75, but unfortunately, that's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but $85 is the lowest I can go.  It's a fair price for this amazing product, and I'm sure you won't regret it.",85.0,Alice,5,
