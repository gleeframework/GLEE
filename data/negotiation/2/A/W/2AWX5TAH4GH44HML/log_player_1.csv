Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal quickly, I believe I can still secure a better price by continuing the negotiation.  $750,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I want to see if I can push Bob closer to my desired price point."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm open to finding common ground, $750,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.

I'm confident that we can finalize this transaction soon. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $775,000. I believe this price is more reasonable, considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm eager to find a mutually beneficial agreement and finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000.

While Bob's offer of $775,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm going to reject this offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round. I have time on my side and there's still a good chance I can get a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $775,000 simply doesn't reflect the true potential of this product.  It's a valuable asset with strong future prospects, and I believe a price closer to $800,000 would be more fair.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This price gives you a great deal, and it allows me to achieve my desired outcome. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement with this compromise.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 825000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose $795,000.

While Bob's offer of $795,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to hold out for a bit longer. I only have 4 rounds left, so I need to be careful. However, there's a chance that I can push Bob just a little further and get my full asking price."
