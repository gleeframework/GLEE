Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $775,000 simply doesn't reflect the true potential of this product.  It's a valuable asset with strong future prospects, and I believe a price closer to $800,000 would be more fair.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $825,000.

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to come up on your price. $795,000 is definitely getting closer to what I'm looking for. However, as this product is truly unique and holds a lot of potential, I can only accept a price of $800,000. It's my minimum acceptable price, and it ensures I can meet my own financial goals.
