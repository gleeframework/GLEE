Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I believe you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Motivating language:** My message highlights the product's value and emphasizes the deal aspect, hoping to entice Bob to consider.
* **Room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to go lower, but I'll still be aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum than his maximum.
* **John as backup:** The knowledge that I have another buyer willing to pay my minimum gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting this offer would mean a significant loss for me.
* **Leveraging John:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum. This gives me the flexibility to reject Bob's low offer.
* **Counteroffer potential:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer that is more favorable to me, potentially reaching a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in this price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** My counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This shows flexibility while maintaining a favorable position.
* **Fairness emphasis:**  I emphasize the ""fair deal"" aspect, appealing to Bob's sense of compromise and encouraging a positive response.
* **Avoiding John:** For now, I want to see if I can close the deal with Bob. Selling to John is a guaranteed option, but I'm hoping to maximize my profit through negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm still very interested, but to make this work for me, I'd need to be closer to $10,000. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  While $10,500 is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum of $15,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** If I reject this offer and make a counteroffer, there's a risk that Bob will walk away or continue to haggle, potentially leading to a lower price.
* **Time factor:**  Negotiations can be time-consuming, and the longer it takes, the more likely it is that either Bob or I will lose interest.
* **John as a fallback:** I still have John as a guaranteed buyer if this deal falls through. 

At this point, accepting the offer minimizes my risk while still securing a reasonable price."
