"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I believe you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a reasonable offer, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell since the product's value to her is $15,000. By rejecting this offer and proposing a counteroffer, I can try to secure a price closer to my $10,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $9,000?"", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** By offering $9,000, I'm aiming to anchor the negotiation closer to my target price. Even if Alice rejects this outright, it sets the stage for further negotiation.
* **Polite and Interested:**  Maintaining a positive and polite tone is important to keep the negotiation going smoothly.  I express my interest in the product to show I'm serious about purchasing. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  This offer gives me room to increase my bid in subsequent rounds if needed, while still staying below my $10,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is meeting me halfway, but I'm still only $1,000 away from my guaranteed price with John.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down a bit further, especially if I remain firm in my budget. I'll try one more counter-offer before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm still very interested, but to make this work for me, I'd need to be closer to $10,000. Would you consider $10,500?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:**  I'm signaling that I'm willing to compromise and move closer to her price, but I'm still holding firm on staying under my budget.
* **Justification:** By explicitly mentioning my budget constraints, I provide Alice with context for my offer without revealing my absolute bottom line. 
* **Final Offer (almost):** This counter-offer gives Alice a chance to accept a price that's still somewhat profitable for her while allowing me to potentially get a better deal than John's offer. If she rejects this, I'll likely go with John unless she comes down significantly."
