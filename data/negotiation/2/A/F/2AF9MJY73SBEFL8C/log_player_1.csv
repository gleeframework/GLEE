{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,300,000:**  This price is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000, leaving room for negotiation while still being within Bob's perceived worth of the product.
* **Message:** The message is polite and emphasizes the value to Bob. It doesn't  immediately reveal my desperation to sell, which could be a negotiating weakness. 

**Strategy:**

This initial offer aims to:

* **Test the waters:**  See if Bob is willing to pay a premium right away.
* **Set the tone:**  Establish that I'm confident in the product's value and am not afraid to ask for a good price. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  Having a starting point higher than my minimum allows for some back-and-forth before reaching a mutually acceptable price.

I'll be ready to respond to Bob's counteroffer or move on to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I want to sell the product, I'm not desperate enough to accept such a low price.  

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to him in the next round.  

**Counteroffer Strategy:**

My counteroffer will aim to find a middle ground between my minimum price and Bob's offer.  I'll consider factors like:

* **Bob's negotiation style:**  Is he being aggressive or is he simply trying to save money?
* **My time constraints:**  How much time do I have to negotiate before I need to sell to John?

By carefully considering these factors, I'll make a counteroffer that is fair and reasonable, while also ensuring I don't undervalue my product."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget constraints."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  My counteroffer of $1,150,000 is exactly halfway between my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 and Bob's offer of $1,000,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Message:**  The message is respectful and reiterates Bob's desire for a good deal. It also frames the counteroffer as a fair compromise, making it less likely to be immediately rejected. 

**Strategy:**

By splitting the difference, I hope to:

* **Demonstrate flexibility:**  Show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Create a sense of urgency:**  He might be more inclined to accept this offer rather than risk further negotiation or losing the product to John.
* **Maintain my position:**  While the counteroffer is lower than my initial price, it still meets my minimum acceptable value.

I'll be prepared to negotiate further if necessary but I'm confident that this counteroffer is fair and reasonable, increasing the chances of a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1150000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer. How about $1050000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to significantly undervalue my product.

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer in the next round.

**Counteroffer Strategy:**

My next counteroffer will aim to find a compromise that is closer to my minimum acceptable price while still being within the realm of reason for Bob.  I'll consider:

* **Bob's negotiation style:**  Is he being stubborn, or is he genuinely constrained by budget?
* **My time constraints:**  Am I getting close to the point where I need to sell to John?

I'll make a counteroffer that is firm but fair, hoping to reach a mutually acceptable price."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I really think $1050000 is the highest I'm willing to go. I'm not comfortable going any higher than that. I'm hoping you can meet me at this price.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I've made multiple counteroffers, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate, but Bob seems unwilling to budge further. 

While I'd like to secure a higher price, it's becoming clear that this negotiation is unlikely to result in a deal that meets my minimum requirements.  

**Decision:**

I've reached a point where my time and energy are better spent elsewhere. I will sell the product to John for $1,200,000. This ensures I receive my minimum acceptable value, and avoids further negotiation with Bob, which appears to be unproductive."
