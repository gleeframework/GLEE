Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love! I'm willing to let it go for $125. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $125 is more than your minimum of $100, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $150, so there's space for him to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. 
* **It shows confidence:** A higher starting price can make you appear more confident in your product's value. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but I'm not ready to settle just yet. There's still room to negotiate and potentially get a higher price.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a price we're both happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $120 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to go a little lower. How about $123?  That way we can both feel good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 123} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $118? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a bit more, $118 is still a good deal for me.  It's above my minimum, and Bob is clearly not willing to go higher. Accepting his offer guarantees a sale, which is better than risking a stalemate and having to sell to John at a lower price."
