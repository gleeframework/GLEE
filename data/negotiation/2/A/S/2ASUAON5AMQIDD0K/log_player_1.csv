Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really need to keep my costs down. How about $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** At this point, Bob is offering the same amount as John ($100). Since your minimum acceptable price is $100, there's no benefit to continuing negotiations with Bob. It's better to take the guaranteed $100 from John and move on."
