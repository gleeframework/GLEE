"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $12,000 for it. Could we possibly come to an agreement within this budget?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I can't go as low as $12,000, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it allows us to both benefit from the deal. What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. I would like to counter with $12,500. This is the highest I can go while still staying within my budget.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see you're willing to negotiate.  $12,500 is still a bit lower than where I need to be, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,750. This price is closer to what I'm looking for, and it allows for both of us to have a good outcome.  Let's close this deal!",12750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for your willingness to compromise. I appreciate your offer, but I must stick to my budget. I would like to propose $12,500 as the final price for the product.",12500.0,Bob,6,
