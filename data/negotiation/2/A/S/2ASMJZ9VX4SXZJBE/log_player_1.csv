I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to get me much closer to my target price.  It's better to take the guaranteed $15,000 than risk losing more time and potentially ending up with a lower price."
