Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $115 for it."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) to leave room for negotiation but aim for a higher profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By offering $115, I signal that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also aiming for a price significantly above my minimum ($100).

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a favorable deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $105 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll aim for a counteroffer that's closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer suggests a compromise, aiming to find a price point that's fair for both parties.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  While still negotiating, I'm ensuring the price remains above my minimum acceptable price ($100).
* **Encouraging Agreement:** By framing it as ""meeting in the middle,"" I'm promoting a sense of fairness and encouraging Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Can you consider $108? It's getting close to the original offer, but I'd like to save a bit more 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $108 is still a profitable price for me, exceeding my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the sale altogether. Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, and further haggling might not yield significantly better results. 
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids potentially lengthy negotiations and ensures I can move on."
