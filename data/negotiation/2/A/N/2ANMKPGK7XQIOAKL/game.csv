"Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product at a price of $1,750,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality asset. I'm confident it will be a valuable addition to your business.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a much lower price.  How about we start at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  Given its value and potential, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and it leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but it's still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and it would allow us to close the deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget to stick to, but $950,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I truly believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
