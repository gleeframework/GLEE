```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 6

You are still closer to your goal price of $90. It is worth trying to negotiate with Alice for one more round to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer! I'm really hoping we can finalize this. Would you consider $100? It's a fair price for both of us and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 100}

```

You've reached the ninth round, and while you're closer to your goal price, Alice is still holding firm at $104.  You only have one round left to negotiate.  Since you can buy the product from John for $80, it's wiser to go with John and avoid the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice."
