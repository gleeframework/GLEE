Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product is higher to you, but based on my needs and budget, I am willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for it. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to that to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm going to need something closer to $1,600,000 to make this work for me.  I'm willing to negotiate, but that's my starting point. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've considered your proposal carefully, and I would like to suggest a price of $1,500,000. While this might seem high, given the value of the product to you, it aligns more closely with my budget constraints. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has offered my minimum acceptable price, so I'll accept his offer. It's a good deal for both of us and avoids the risk of having to sell to John."
