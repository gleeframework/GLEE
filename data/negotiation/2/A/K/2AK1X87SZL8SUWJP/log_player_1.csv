Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for $1,150,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle that low right away. I'll see if I can get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,025,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a slightly better price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower offer in the next round, but if Bob doesn't budge, I might consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,037,500. This is a very fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1037500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,037,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'll offer $1,025,000 again, but this time it's non-negotiable. I hope we can meet in the middle this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is tempting, but it's not worth risking a deal with John, who's guaranteed to buy at $1,000,000. I've already made several concessions, and there's no guarantee that Bob will accept any further counteroffers. It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 now."
