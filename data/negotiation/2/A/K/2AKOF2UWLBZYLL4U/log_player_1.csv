Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm starting with a price of $14,000, which is a good starting point considering my minimum value is $15,000 and Bob's maximum is $10,000. 
* This offer leaves room for negotiation and potentially reaching a deal that benefits both of us. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll have to analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, make a counteroffer, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price or sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counter-offering at $13,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer of $14,000 and Bob's offer of $12,000. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product at a higher price. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John, as I'm getting closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,500 is still significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000.  I'm getting closer to my desired price but not close enough to justify the risk of further negotiation. John is offering my desired price, so I'm going to sell to him. It's the most secure and profitable option at this point."
