"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $110. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $110 is less than the $120 from John, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $95 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get as close to his maximum value of $120 as possible, but is still willing to negotiate. Offering $95 is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob is serious about getting a good deal, but leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $95 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $105? I'm eager to find a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is better than Alice's initial offer, Bob can likely still get a better price. Rejecting this offer allows for further negotiation and potentially a lower price closer to Bob's desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is inching closer to Alice's desired price while still staying within his budget.  Offering $100 demonstrates a willingness to compromise while also leaving room for a slight adjustment if needed.  This counteroffer positions Bob for a successful negotiation."
