Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still a little high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $100. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to move on to another seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is firmly rooted at $100 and even threatening to walk away.  While we might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars, it's risky. John offers a guaranteed $100, which is our minimum acceptable price.  It's time to take the sure thing and move on."
