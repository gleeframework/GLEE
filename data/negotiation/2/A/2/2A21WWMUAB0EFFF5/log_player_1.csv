{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm initially setting the price at $14,000.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations above your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for bargaining and allows you to potentially secure a higher final price.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial offer will give you insight into Bob's enthusiasm and perceived value of the product. His response will guide your next move. 
* **Alternative Option:** Keep in mind you always have John willing to buy at $10,000. This knowledge gives you a strong position and the ability to walk away if the negotiations don't seem promising."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. How about we set the price at $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly below your minimum:** $8,000 is considerably less than your $10,000 minimum and even further from your initial asking price. Accepting this would be a significant loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Bob's counter-offer indicates he's interested but trying to secure a bargain. There's space to negotiate towards a mutually agreeable price.
* **John as a Backup:** Having John ready to buy at $10,000 provides leverage. It allows you to confidently negotiate with Bob, knowing you have a guaranteed sale at your minimum price if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move things forward, how about we meet in the middle at $12,000?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility (But Not Too Much):** Moving down to $12,000 signals to Bob that you're willing to negotiate. However, it's a substantial jump from his $8,000 offer, reinforcing the product's value. 
* **Target a Favorable Outcome:**  $12,000 represents a solid profit margin for you, making it a desirable outcome. 
* **Maintain a Strong Position:** You're still aiming significantly higher than both Bob's offer and your backup option with John.  This keeps you in a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, considering my budget constraints, could we aim for $10,000 instead? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meets Your Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,000 matches your lowest acceptable price and the amount John is willing to pay. 
* **No Guarantee of a Higher Price:**  While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Bob will go higher. You risk prolonging the negotiation and potentially losing the sale altogether.
* **Secure a Profit:** Accepting the $10,000 offer ensures you make a profit and avoids the potential hassle of finding another buyer."
