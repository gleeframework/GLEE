,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $105 for it. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $110 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product. Let me know what you think.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $115 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm firm on my offer of $105.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and it would be a good deal for me. Let's see if we can make this happen.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on your offer of $105, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $112.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product. Let me know what you think.",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $112.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $110, which is a fair price for both of us. It's a good deal for me, and it's closer to your desired price point. Let's close this deal now.",110.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell at $110. I'll make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $111. It's the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",111.0,Alice,7,
