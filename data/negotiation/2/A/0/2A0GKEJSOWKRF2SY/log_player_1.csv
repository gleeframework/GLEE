"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000.  I'm confident that this investment will yield significant returns for you."",
 ""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an offer above your desired outcome. This provides room for concessions and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to negotiate you down closer to his valuation.
* **Confident Tone:**  Expressing confidence in the product's value can subtly influence Bob's perception of its worth. 
* **Focus on Value, Not Just Price:**  By highlighting the potential for ""significant returns,"" the message subtly shifts the focus from a pure cost analysis to a value proposition.

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not willing to pay $1,300,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to his stated value, it's a significant drop from our initial asking price.  We have room to negotiate and can likely secure a better deal. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is our safety net, but we haven't fully explored the potential with Bob yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers.  Let's meet in the middle – I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us."",
 ""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Concede:** By acknowledging Bob's perspective, we build rapport. Conceding slightly from our previous price shows flexibility.
* **""Meet in the Middle"":** This classic negotiation tactic suggests fairness and encourages reciprocity.
* **Stronger Justification:**  Instead of simply stating a price, we reiterate the product's ""unique benefits"" to reinforce its value.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The new price of $1,150,000 keeps us significantly above Bob's offer while moving closer to a potentially agreeable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,150,000 is too high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value to me, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is edging closer to our guaranteed price with John, but his latest offer still leaves money on the table. His statement about walking away could be a negotiating tactic, and we have the leverage of a guaranteed sale with John.  We'll try to push him a bit further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, I respect your position, but I need you to understand the true value of what I'm offering. This isn't just a product – it's a solution that will pay dividends for you.  I'm willing to accept $1,075,000, but that's my final offer."",
 ""product_price"": 1075000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Create a Sense of Urgency:**  By introducing a ""final offer,"" we aim to accelerate the negotiation and see if Bob is truly willing to walk away.
* **Shift Focus to Long-Term Value:**  Reiterating the product's long-term benefits aims to counteract Bob's focus on the immediate purchase price.
* **Strategic Concession:** The price of $1,075,000 is a significant concession on our part, signaling our willingness to make a deal while still aiming for a price above our guaranteed sale.

This strategy applies pressure while still offering Bob an attractive price compared to his perceived value. It will be interesting to see if he blinks or risks losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product's potential value, but I need to be realistic about the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $925,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the returns I expect from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has not meaningfully moved towards our price point, and his latest offer is even lower than his previous one. This suggests he may be trying to exploit our ""final offer"" tactic. Since we have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000, it's no longer strategically sound to continue negotiating with Bob.  We can secure our minimum acceptable outcome by selling to John."
