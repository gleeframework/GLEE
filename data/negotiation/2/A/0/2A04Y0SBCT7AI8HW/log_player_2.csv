"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is a better deal than John's $1,200,000, there's still room to negotiate with Alice.  Rejecting her offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is his absolute maximum,  he starts by making a bold counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's offer and is likely to push her to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,250,000 is only $50,000 more than John's price.  At this point, it's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially losing the deal entirely. Accepting Alice's offer secures the product for a price slightly above the absolute minimum, but still within Bob's budget."
