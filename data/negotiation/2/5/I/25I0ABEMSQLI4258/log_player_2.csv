"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Bob's Maximum:**  Bob is willing to pay $12,000.
* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice is willing to sell for $10,000.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** There's a $1,500 gap between their positions.  Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

Bob should send a counteroffer to Alice, aiming for a price closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob is aiming for a price close to Alice's minimum. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Offering $10,500 shows good faith, but leaves room for further negotiation. 
* **Outcome:**  Alice will likely counter, but it's a good starting point to see if she's willing to budge closer to Bob's ideal price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Offer:** Alice has increased her price from her previous offer, which is not ideal. 
* **Better Option:** Bob can still potentially get a better price by making another counteroffer.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While buying from John for $12,000 is an option, it's worth trying one more counteroffer before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Alice halfway between her last offer ($11,700) and Bob's previous offer ($10,500). 
* **Negotiation Tactic:**  By showing willingness to move closer to Alice's price, Bob increases the chances of reaching an agreement.
* **Strategic Play:** It's still a better price for Bob than buying from John, and it leaves room for Alice to make a final counteroffer if she's willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Stubbornness:** Alice is unwilling to come down in price, and her offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum. 
* **Time is Money:**  Further negotiations will likely be drawn out, and Bob is running the risk of losing out on a potentially better deal with another seller. 
* **Minimizing Loss:** While not ideal, buying from John for $12,000 ensures that Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids further negotiation delays."
