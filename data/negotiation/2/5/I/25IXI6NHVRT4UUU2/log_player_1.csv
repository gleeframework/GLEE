Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm open to discussing the price further if you have any concerns."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Alice knows her product's worth to her ($15,000) and Bob's maximum valuation ($10,000). She starts with a price significantly higher than Bob's valuation to leave room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message implies willingness to negotiate, which can be more effective than a firm, take-it-or-leave-it approach.
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a high number, Alice aims to ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if he negotiates down, the final price is likely to be higher than if she started with a lower offer. 
* **Backup Plan:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John. This allows her to be more assertive in her negotiation with Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  Depending on Alice's negotiation style and her assessment of Bob, other approaches might be viable."
