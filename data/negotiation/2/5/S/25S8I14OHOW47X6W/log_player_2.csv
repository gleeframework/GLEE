Alice's offer is far too high.  Bob should reject the offer and counter with a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob. However, $10,000 is below its true value to me.  Could you consider $13,000? I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

While $13,000 is closer to Bob's acceptable range, it's still higher than his target price of $8,000. He should continue to negotiate with Alice."
