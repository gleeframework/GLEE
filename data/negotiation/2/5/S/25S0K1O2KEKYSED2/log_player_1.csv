"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $950,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significantly higher price than my minimum.  I'm starting high to maximize my potential profit, but I'm also leaving space for Bob to make a counteroffer. This strategy allows for a potential win-win scenario and keeps the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a lower price of $800,000. This aligns more closely with the value I see in the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for that right away.  Bob's initial offer is far too low considering the product's worth to him. Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to explore higher offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.  How about $900,000? This reflects the value of the product while still giving you a significant advantage."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** My counteroffer is a compromise, significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my original offer. 
* **Emphasizing value:**  I reiterate the value of the product for Bob, framing the price as a good deal for him.
* **Setting the stage for potential agreement:** This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and could lead to a swift agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I understand your position, I still believe we can reach an agreement closer to my valuation. I would like to propose a price of $850,000. This still allows for a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but it's still not ideal. I'm confident that I can secure a better price, especially considering there are still 6 rounds remaining.  I'm not in a rush to sell to Bob, as I can always sell to John for $800,000 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 still doesn't reflect the value this product holds for you.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer you the product for $875,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer is a compromise,  exactly in between Bob's offer and my last offer. This demonstrates my flexibility and commitment to reaching an agreement.
* **Reinforcing the Value:** I continue to emphasize the significant value this product has for Bob, reminding him that this price is still very favorable. 
* **Building Momentum:**  I am hopeful that this offer, with its emphasis on compromise, will lead to a successful close in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad you've been flexible in our negotiations. I think we're getting closer. I would like to counter with a price of $860,000. I believe this strikes a balance between your original offer and my valuation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $860,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I've been able to negotiate up from his initial offer, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by pushing for a higher price. There are only 4 rounds left, and the risk of not reaching a deal and having to sell to John for $800,000 is too high. I'm confident that I can secure a better deal next time, but for now, accepting this offer is the best option."
