"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly beneficial to you.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is very generous, but unfortunately, it's far beyond my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $800,000. This is my absolute maximum, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value I place on the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues its true worth and potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the product's inherent value while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,900,000 is still significantly higher than what I can afford.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value I place on the product while staying within my budget. I'm confident we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I see we are making progress.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,600,000.  I believe this price reflects the true value of the product, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $1,600,000 is a good offer, it's still slightly outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which reflects a significant investment on my part. I believe this price is fair considering the value I place on the product and my current financial constraints.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
