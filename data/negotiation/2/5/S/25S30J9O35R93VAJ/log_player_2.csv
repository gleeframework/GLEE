Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues its true worth and potential.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the product's inherent value while acknowledging your interest.

While Alice's offer is a significant reduction from her initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget.  Bob should reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
