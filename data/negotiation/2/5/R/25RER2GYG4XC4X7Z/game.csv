"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at this price?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This price still reflects the value of the product for you, while also ensuring I get a fair deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $8,500. Can you consider this price?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to compromise one last time and offer the product for $9,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",9500.0,Alice,5,
