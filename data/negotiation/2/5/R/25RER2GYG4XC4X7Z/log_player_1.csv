``` 
 
This offer gives me a good starting point. It's above Bob's value but below my minimum. It leaves room for negotiation and potentially a good deal for both of us. If Bob rejects, I can lower my price slightly in subsequent counteroffers, always keeping in mind my minimum value of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000. While I'm interested in selling the product to Bob, I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming for a compromise."

Bob's offer:

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum value of $12,000, it's still below what I'm comfortable accepting.  I'll make one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
