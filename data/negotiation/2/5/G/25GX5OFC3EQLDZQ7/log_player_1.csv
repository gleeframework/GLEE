Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75.

 Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price, and I am confident I can get a better deal. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $75 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about $78? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $75. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk further negotiation. Selling to John guarantees me a profit, and it's a better deal than what Bob is offering."
