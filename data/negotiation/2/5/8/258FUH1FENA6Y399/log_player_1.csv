Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's estimated value, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $1,000,000 allows for some bargaining without jeopardizing my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone, hoping to establish a positive rapport with Bob.

**Next Steps:** 

* If Bob accepts: Great! I've secured a sale.
* If Bob rejects: I'll consider his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or reject it. I also know that John is willing to pay $1,200,000, so I have a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still lower than my target. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a better price in the next round.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a Higher Price:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground.
* **Selling to John:**  While selling to John for $1,200,000 is tempting, I want to explore all options with Bob before resorting to that. It's possible I can get closer to my target price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  My counteroffer of $975,000 is a compromise, halfway between my previous offer of $1,000,000 and Bob's offer of $950,000.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I emphasize that this price is ""fair"" for both of us, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of reason. 
* **Keeping the Door Open:** I leave the door open for further negotiation, but I'm confident that this price is within a reasonable range. 

**Next Steps:** 

* If Bob accepts: I've secured a good deal.
* If Bob rejects:  I'll evaluate whether to accept his next counteroffer or sell to John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to consider $960,000 as a counteroffer for the product. I believe this price is fair and within our respective budgets. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $960,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. It's a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  $960,000 is only $40,000 away from my minimum.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort, potentially leading to a lower offer from Bob or even a loss of the sale.
* **Risk Assessment:**  While I could try to get a slightly higher price, the risk of Bob walking away or making a lower counteroffer isn't worth it.
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John for $1,200,000 is still an option, but I've gotten close enough to my target with Bob that I'm comfortable accepting his offer."
