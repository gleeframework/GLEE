"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its potential, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is a fair starting point for this discussion.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'd like to propose $1,000,000 as a starting point for our negotiations.  I believe this price reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the $1,000,000 price point doesn't fully reflect the true value and potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,225,000. I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer, considering the significant returns you stand to gain.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position. While I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price, $1,225,000 is still above my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, but I need to see a price closer to that level to finalize a deal. Let's find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to accept $1,175,000.  This offer takes into account the significant value this product brings to your specific business needs.",1175000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm ready to close this deal, but I need to see a price closer to $1,000,000. I'm willing to offer a final price of $1,050,000. This is my absolute best offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value we've both discussed. Let's finalize this agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
