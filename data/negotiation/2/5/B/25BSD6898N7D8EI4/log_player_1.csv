"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a relatively high price ($15,000) as I don't know Bob's perceived value. This allows room for negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:** My message highlights the potential value of the product to Bob, without revealing specific details that could be used against me.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm making it clear that I'm open to negotiation, inviting Bob to respond.

This approach balances maximizing profit with keeping the negotiation open and flexible for the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is there any flexibility on the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  $8,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Opportunity to counter.**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired value, keeping the negotiation going.
* **Maintaining leverage.** Selling to John immediately would secure a guaranteed $10,000, but there's still a chance I can get more from Bob.  

In the next round, I'll counter with a price higher than $8,000, but still lower than my initial offer, to encourage continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $8,000 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's a price I can work with."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering a price halfway between my initial offer ($15,000) and Bob's offer ($8,000). This shows good faith and willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I emphasize that this is still a ""great deal"" for Bob, subtly reinforcing the perceived value of the product.
* **Reframing the Offer:**  Instead of simply rejecting Bob's price, I'm reframing the offer as a compromise that benefits both of us.

By offering a reasonable counteroffer and maintaining a positive tone, I aim to keep Bob engaged and increase the chances of a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but $11500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $9000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.**  $9,000 is still less than my $10,000 floor, even though it's getting closer. 
* **Room for negotiation.**  There's still a chance to get closer to my desired price. Rejecting the offer allows me to counter with a slightly higher price, potentially pushing Bob closer to my minimum.
* **Balancing risk and reward.** While selling to John would be a guaranteed $10,000, I'm not willing to give up on a potentially better deal with Bob just yet. 

I'll counter with a price slightly higher than $9,000, keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. To show my willingness to continue negotiating, I'm offering $9,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  My counteroffer of $9,500 is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer while still being above my minimum.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I reinforce the value of the product and suggest it's a ""win-win"" for both parties, making it more appealing.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive tone, encouraging Bob to see the potential for a successful deal.

By offering a slightly higher price and using positive language, I aim to push Bob towards accepting my offer and closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9000, but I think that's my limit. Can you meet me at $9000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is at my minimum.** While $9,000 is my floor price, I've been through several rounds of negotiation and haven't been able to reach a higher price.
* **Limited time and risk.** I've only got a few rounds left, and continuing to negotiate carries the risk of losing the deal completely. 
* **Guaranteed sale with John.** Selling to John at $10,000 is a guaranteed way to secure a good price, given the limited time and the potential for a stalemate with Bob. 

By choosing to sell to John, I'm minimizing the risk of getting a lower price from Bob and ensuring a reasonable profit."
