Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering Bob the product for $1,500,000. This is higher than John's offer of $1,200,000, giving me a chance to earn more.
* I'm not going too high with the price, as I don't want to risk Bob rejecting the offer outright. 
* This is a calculated risk, as I don't know Bob's valuation. If he values the product at $1,500,000 or higher, he'll accept the offer. If not, I'll still get my guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
