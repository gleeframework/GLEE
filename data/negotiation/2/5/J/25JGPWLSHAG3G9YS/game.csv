"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I think you'll love it, and I'm confident it will meet your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value is worth $10,000 to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering your offer of $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable going all the way down to $9,000, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,200. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm finding it hard to justify going above $9,000.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $9,100?",9100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm getting close to accepting your offer, but I'm still not comfortable going all the way to $9,100. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,200 and $9,100, which would be $9,150. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",9150.0,Alice,7,
