Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will benefit you greatly. I'm asking for $1,200,000. Let me know if you're interested, as I have other potential buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you have room to start high.  A price of $1,200,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit.
* **Value proposition:** The message emphasizes the product's value without revealing your bottom line. 
* **Sense of urgency:** Mentioning ""other potential buyers"" subtly encourages Bob to act quickly and consider the offer seriously.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's perspective:**  While the product is worth $800,000 to Bob, his willingness to pay more might be influenced by factors like budget constraints, perceived return on investment, and competition for the product.
* **Negotiation strategy:** This initial offer sets the stage for potential negotiation. Be prepared to adjust your price based on Bob's response and your assessment of his willingness to pay."
