Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the value of this product, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000, which is a fair price considering the value I see in this product. I hope we can reach a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

{

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're passionate about this product, but $1,800,000 is still too far from my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my genuine interest. I believe this price fairly reflects the value we both see in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob is unlikely to move much higher than $1,400,000. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
