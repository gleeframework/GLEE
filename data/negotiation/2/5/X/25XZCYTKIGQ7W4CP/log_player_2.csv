"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. After careful consideration of its unique features and benefits, we believe it's worth more than $1200000 to us. However, we're open to discussing the price. Our initial offer for this exceptional product is $1500000. We understand that value perception can vary, so let's work together to find a price that reflects both the quality of our product and your needs. Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is your maximum price.  There's no immediate gain in accepting.  Rejecting and counter-offering allows you to potentially get a lower price. You can always fall back to John's offer if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the unique features of this product, $1,500,000 is a bit above my initial budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which reflects the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
