"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $180. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price to give myself room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Reasonable:** My message is polite and expresses interest while making it clear I'm looking for a substantial discount. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By starting low, I'm aiming to understand Alice's bottom line and how flexible she might be on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is too low for me. Could you do $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** $130 is closer to my budget, but still significantly more than I want to pay. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's counter-offer suggests she's willing to negotiate. There's space to meet somewhere in the middle. 
* **John as Backup:** I'll keep John in mind as a backup option if the negotiation doesn't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm trying to stick to a tight budget.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise by significantly increasing my offer.
* **Targeting a Sweet Spot:** $105 is still below my maximum budget but a reasonable jump from my previous offer, potentially enticing Alice while leaving room for a final adjustment.
* **Clear and Direct:**  The message is clear about my desired price and implies that this is a serious offer."
