You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is below her perceived value, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000 and what John offers. Rejecting this offer opens the possibility of negotiating a better price with Alice or proceeding to purchase from John at a more favorable cost."
