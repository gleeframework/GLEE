"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you my unique product for $15000. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I believe it has significant value. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always good to start by seeing if you can get a better price. While $15,000 is your limit, there's no reason to jump at the first offer.  Rejecting allows for negotiation and potentially a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. A $5,000 drop shows I'm serious about buying but also leaves room for compromise. This also helps me understand how much she wants to sell the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $12000 to make this deal happen.  It's a fair price considering the product's unique value. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still a bit high. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial counteroffer.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer allows for further negotiation and potentially a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still a bit hesitant at $12,000.  How about $11,000? It's a fair compromise that allows us to both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows that I'm serious about buying the product but am still trying to get a better price. A $1,000 decrease from Alice's last offer shows a willingness to compromise while still staying within my price range."
