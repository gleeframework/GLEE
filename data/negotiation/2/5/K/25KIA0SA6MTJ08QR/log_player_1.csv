Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to offer it for $20,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a favorable outcome. 
* **Justification:** While the price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, the message hints at the product's broader value and time sensitivity, aiming to create a sense of urgency and potential loss if he declines.
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, so there's no risk of losing money. If Bob rejects the offer, you're still securing your minimum price.

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters.  You can gradually lower the price, but aim to stay above your $15,000 minimum."
