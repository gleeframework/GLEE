**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob.**  While Bob could get the product from John for $1,500,000, Alice is offering it for $1,200,000. This saves Bob $300,000.
* **The offer is within Bob's budget.** Bob is willing to pay up to $1,500,000, so $1,200,000 is well within that range. 

Therefore, the best decision for Bob is to accept Alice's offer."
