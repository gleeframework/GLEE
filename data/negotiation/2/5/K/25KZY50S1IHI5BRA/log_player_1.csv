Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's estimated value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  While $1,800,000 is more than Bob's perceived value, it's still less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Strategic Play:** This initial high offer signals my confidence in the product's value and encourages Bob to engage in a negotiation. 

I'm confident that Bob, seeing the value in the product, will be willing to negotiate, and I can leverage John's offer of $1,500,000 as a safety net if Bob is unwilling to meet my demands."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, it shows he's willing to negotiate. I believe there's still room for a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Leveraging John's Offer:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my leverage, knowing that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails.

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer, aiming to secure a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  My counteroffer of $1,600,000 represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. It also leaves some room for further discussion.
* **Keeping a Margin:**  While $1,600,000 is still below my ideal price, it's above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This ensures that I won't lose out on a significant profit.
* **Strategic Compromise:** By making a reasonable counteroffer, I'm signaling to Bob that I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. This increases the likelihood of reaching an agreement.

This counteroffer creates a more balanced negotiation, allowing for further dialogue and potential compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Unacceptable:**  $1,000,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss for me and wouldn't be a financially sound decision. 
* **Limited Negotiation Potential:** Bob's continued low offers suggest that he may not be willing to come closer to my desired price range.  Further negotiation with him might be unproductive and time-consuming.
* **Securing the Safe Option:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, ensuring I don't settle for a significantly lower offer. 

It's more advantageous to secure a guaranteed profit by selling to John rather than risking further negotiation with Bob, who appears unwilling to meet my minimum acceptable price."
