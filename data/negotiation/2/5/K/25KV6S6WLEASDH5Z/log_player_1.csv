Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. If Bob rejects, I'll gauge his interest level and adjust accordingly.  I'm confident that I can get at least $8,000 from John if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$7,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to accept a price that's significantly below my minimum. I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a good profit. I'm willing to be flexible, but I'm not going to go too much lower.  I'm confident that I can get a better price than $7,000, and I'm willing to continue negotiating to get it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has finally come up to my minimum price. I'm happy to accept his offer and sell the product to him for $8,000. It's a fair price and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
