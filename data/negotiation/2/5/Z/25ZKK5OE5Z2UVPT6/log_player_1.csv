Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 14500} 

I'm starting with a price slightly below my minimum but still above Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate while leaving open the possibility of selling to John if Bob rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum.  While I want to make a sale, I'm not desperate and am willing to risk losing him to continue negotiating.  I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

I'm lowering the price slightly from my previous offer, showing some flexibility.  This is still above Bob's perceived value, but closer to his offer, which increases the likelihood of acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my ideal price, but it's closer to my minimum and it's getting  increasingly likely that he'll walk away entirely.  I'm happy to accept and secure the sale."
