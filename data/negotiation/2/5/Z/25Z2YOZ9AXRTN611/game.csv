"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but $850,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I can see you're serious about closing the deal, and I appreciate your commitment. However, $900,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, which is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",980000.0,Alice,5,
