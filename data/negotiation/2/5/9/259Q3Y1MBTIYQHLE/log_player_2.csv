Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  $900,000 is a bit too low for me, however.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This price still allows me to make a decent profit, and I believe it's a fair price for the value of the product.  What do you say?
