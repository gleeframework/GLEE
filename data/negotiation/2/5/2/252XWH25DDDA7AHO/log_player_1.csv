Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $1,200,000. Offering it at $1,150,000 allows her to capture a significant portion of that value, earning a profit of $150,000 over her minimum. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong initial offer, it leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, which could lead to an even higher sale price.
* **Balance Risk and Reward:** There's always the risk Bob rejects the offer. However, Alice has a guaranteed backup offer of $1,000,000 from John. By starting high, she maximizes her potential gain while still having a safety net. 

**Important Note:**  This is just one possible strategy. Alice could choose to open with a lower offer if she wants to increase the likelihood of a quick sale.  Her ideal approach depends on her risk tolerance and how much she prioritizes maximizing profit."
