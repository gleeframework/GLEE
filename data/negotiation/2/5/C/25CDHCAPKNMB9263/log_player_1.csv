"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm starting with a high price to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. I'm also considering that if he rejects, I can always sell to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob in the hopes of getting a better price, but I'm aware that I can always sell to John for a guaranteed higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer but still aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that could lead to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  With only 6 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John."
