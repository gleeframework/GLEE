This is a starting point, and I'm aiming high.  I'm hoping Bob values the product significantly higher than $1,500,000.  If he doesn't, we can negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$1,200,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price."

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway.  $1,750,000 is still a good amount for me, and it might be a good enough deal for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'll counter-offer again to see if we can reach a compromise."

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to $1,600,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still maintain a price that's profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

```

Bob is clearly not willing to go any higher than $1,450,000.  While that's better than my minimum, it's not enough to justify further negotiation. I'll accept John's offer to sell for $1,500,000, which is a much more comfortable margin for me."
