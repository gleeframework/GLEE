{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $140. It's worth every penny, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a slightly higher price to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but $110 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $125 for this product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're willing to come down, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $115 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $115 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to close the deal closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, but $115 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120, which is my absolute minimum.  This is a great product, and I know you'll be happy with it.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 120}
