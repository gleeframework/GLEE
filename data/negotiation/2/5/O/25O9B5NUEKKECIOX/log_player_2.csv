"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $100. I think you'll find it's a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $100.** This is less than your maximum price of $120. 
* **Buying from Alice saves you $20** compared to buying from John. 
* Therefore, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer."
