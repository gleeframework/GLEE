"I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. However, that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $500,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $500,000 is a significant reduction from your initial offer, but I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this stage. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate the movement, but $900,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $700,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'll offer you $850,000. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal. What are your thoughts?",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting close. I appreciate you working with me on the price. Honestly, with my budget, anything above $800,000 is really pushing it. I'm willing to do $810,000, but that's my absolute limit.",810000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $810,000 and $850,000, which is $830,000. This is my final compromise. What are your thoughts?",830000.0,Alice,7,
