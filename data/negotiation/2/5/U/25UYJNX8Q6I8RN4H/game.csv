"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand its worth to you is significant, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that reflects its worth to both of us. I'm asking $12,000 for the product. This allows for a good profit for me while still offering you a substantial saving compared to its value to you.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
