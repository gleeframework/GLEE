"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand its worth to you is significant, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that reflects its worth to both of us. I'm asking $12,000 for the product. This allows for a good profit for me while still offering you a substantial saving compared to its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer
