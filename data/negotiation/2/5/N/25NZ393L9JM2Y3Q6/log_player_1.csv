"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that it's likely Bob will reject it. This allows me to gauge his interest and begin the negotiation process.  I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum price ($120) as possible, but also want to see if I can get more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm countering with $130. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also maintains my value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is getting closer to my minimum price of $120.  While it's still below my ideal price, I'm worried about running out of rounds and being stuck with John's offer of $120. It's risky, but I'm going to take the deal and sell to Bob."
