"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can we meet in the middle at $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, how about $12000?  That seems like a fair compromise.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $12000. I'm willing to go up to $9500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back and forth, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9500 and $11000, which is $10250. Can we agree on that price?",10250.0,Bob,6,
