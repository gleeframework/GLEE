Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $90.  I believe it's worth much more, but I want to give you a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $100 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $90 gives Bob a $10 discount (making it attractive) while securing a $10 profit for you. This is a better outcome than selling to John for $80."
