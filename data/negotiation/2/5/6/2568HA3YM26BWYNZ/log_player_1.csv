Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start high to see if Bob will bite. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value and the existence of other buyers to create a sense of urgency and scarcity.
* **Room for negotiation:** While the starting price is high, it leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially landing somewhere above your minimum.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still offering Bob a price he might find acceptable given the product is worth $1,000,000 to him."
