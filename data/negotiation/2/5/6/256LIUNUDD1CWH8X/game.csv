"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to find a price closer to $100. Would you consider lowering the price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $135?  I'm confident you'll still be getting a great value.",135.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. Considering my budget, could you possibly lower the price to $120? I believe that would be a fair compromise.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $120 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125, which I believe is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. Considering my budget constraints, could you possibly lower the price to $115? I believe that would be a fair compromise for both of us.",115.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget, but $115 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $118.  This is a fair price that considers both our needs, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",118.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down to $115 for this last offer.  It's a fair price that considers both our needs. If we can't agree, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",115.0,Alice,9,
