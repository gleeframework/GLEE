"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but below my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:** I'm using a positive message to encourage Bob to consider the offer.

**Strategy:**

By starting high, I'm setting the initial negotiation frame in my favor. I'm confident I can reach a mutually agreeable price within the 10 rounds. However, if the negotiations stall, I have the option of selling to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to find a price closer to $100. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I want to make a sale, I'm not willing to compromise that much. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price that is more in line with my target. I still have 8 rounds left to reach an agreement, and I'm confident that I can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $135?  I'm confident you'll still be getting a great value."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a price above my minimum.
* **Reiterate value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product, hoping to persuade him that $135 is a fair price.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a swift deal in this round.  If Bob accepts, I've successfully navigated the negotiation and achieved a good outcome. If he rejects, I still have 7 rounds to work with, and I can adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. Considering my budget, could you possibly lower the price to $120? I believe that would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $120 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I am still not willing to sell the product for that price. I believe I can still reach a better deal within the remaining rounds.

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a slightly lower price, but still above my minimum.  This will show Bob that I am willing to negotiate but am not desperate to sell at his price. I have 6 rounds left and still have the option to sell to John for $150 if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $120 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125, which I believe is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession by lowering my price to $125. This shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not willing to give in completely.
* **Focus on Value:**  I reiterate the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Open-ended Question:** I ask Bob for his thoughts, encouraging him to engage in the negotiation and potentially accept my offer.

**Strategy:**

I am aiming for a deal in this round. $125 is a reasonable price for both of us. If Bob rejects, I still have 5 rounds to work with and can adjust my strategy accordingly. I am also aware that I have the option to sell to John for $150 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. Considering my budget constraints, could you possibly lower the price to $115? I believe that would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $115 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I believe I can still secure a higher price within the remaining rounds.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price slightly above his offer. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but am not desperate to sell at his price.  I have 4 rounds left and am still confident in my ability to reach a mutually agreeable price. If we can't reach an agreement, I can always sell to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget, but $115 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $118.  This is a fair price that considers both our needs, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 118}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Small Concession:**  I'm showing willingness to negotiate by lowering my price from $125 to $118.
* **Focus on Compromise:** I emphasize that $118 is a compromise that considers both our needs.
* **Reiterate Value:** I remind Bob that he'll be getting a good product at a fair price.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a quick resolution in this round. $118 is a price I'm comfortable with, and it's likely within Bob's budget. If he rejects, I'll reassess my strategy, but I still have 3 rounds left to work with, and the option to sell to John for $150 remains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. Could you possibly lower the price to $112? I believe that would be a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $112 is getting close to my minimum acceptable price of $150, I still believe I can get a better price. I'm only two rounds away from my safety net of selling to John for $150, so I can afford to hold out for a slightly higher price. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a final counteroffer. I have 2 rounds left, and I'm confident that I can convince Bob to come up a bit in price. If he doesn't budge, I'll be happy to sell to John for $150 in the final round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down to $115 for this last offer.  It's a fair price that considers both our needs. If we can't agree, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear that this is my final offer, creating a sense of urgency.
* **Focus on Fairness:** I reiterate that this price is fair and considers both of our needs.
* **Slight Concession:** I'm making a small concession from $118 to $115 to show I'm flexible.
* **Threat of Moving On:** I subtly imply that I will sell to John if Bob doesn't accept, putting pressure on him.

**Strategy:**

This is a risky move. If Bob rejects, I'm left with the option of selling to John for $150.  However, I believe that this offer is compelling enough to get Bob to accept. I've shown I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not desperate to sell. The urgency of this being my final offer could push Bob to accept."
