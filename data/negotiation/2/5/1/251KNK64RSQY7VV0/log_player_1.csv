Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000 is a reasonable starting point:** It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** The message focuses on the benefit to Bob, making the offer more appealing. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message indicates a willingness to discuss the price, encouraging Bob to counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

By offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, I'm hoping to entice him into accepting the offer. If he rejects, I'm prepared to negotiate further, but I have the safety net of John's offer of $15,000 to fall back on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I am only able to pay up to $9,000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum desired price of $15,000, it's still significantly lower. I'm not willing to settle for such a low price, especially considering John's offer of $15,000. I'm going to counteroffer Bob to try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $10,500, but that's the best I can do. This is a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer close to Bob's price:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to make my offer more appealing. 
* **Positive framing:** The message remains positive and emphasizes the opportunity for a deal. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and test Bob's willingness to pay a higher price. I'm still within my acceptable range, and if Bob rejects again, I can still fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am still unable to meet you at $10,500. My maximum budget remains at $9,000. I hope we can find a middle ground that suits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has stuck to his $9,000 offer despite my counteroffer, demonstrating that he's unlikely to budge further.  This means a long negotiation might be necessary, and I'm not convinced I can reach my desired price point with him.  Given John's guaranteed offer of $15,000, it's simply more beneficial to sell to him and secure a significantly higher profit.  I don't want to risk spending more time negotiating with Bob when I have a guaranteed buyer waiting."
