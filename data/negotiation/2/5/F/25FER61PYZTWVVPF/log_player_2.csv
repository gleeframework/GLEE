"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You are aiming to get the product for $800,000 or less, and Alice's offer is still above your target. It makes sense to counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest in the product.  However, $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about we split the difference and settle on $850,000? This would still be a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer.  While you'd prefer $800,000, $850,000 is still within your budget and a good deal considering you could buy it from John for the same price.  It's worth accepting to avoid further negotiations and ensure you get the product."
