"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,000. This is a good starting point as it's a bit higher than the product's worth to Bob, but not so high that it's immediately rejected. I'm hoping this will encourage negotiation and allow us to find a price that's beneficial for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept $7,500, I believe I can still get closer to my target price of $8,000. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with $8,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still allows me to get a higher price than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my target price, I still believe I can do better. It's worth risking another round to see if I can reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8200}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with $8,200. This is another compromise, but it's still closer to my target price than Bob's last offer. I'm hoping that we can finally reach an agreement in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $8,000.  While Bob's offer is getting closer, we've been at this for a while and it's not clear if we'll be able to reach an agreement that's satisfactory to both of us.  It's safer to secure the guaranteed sale with John at this point."
