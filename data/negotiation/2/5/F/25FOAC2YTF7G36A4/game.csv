"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your consideration, $13,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $12,500. This price ensures a good deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. However, given the production costs and my business objectives, I am unable to accept $12,500 for the product. I would like to propose a price of $13,000. This price allows for a reasonable profit margin while still being competitive in the market. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
