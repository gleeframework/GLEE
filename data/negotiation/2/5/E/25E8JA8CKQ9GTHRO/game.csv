"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,000,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for this product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $2,000,000 reflects the true value of this product, I understand your perspective.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. I believe this revised price represents a fair compromise.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,250,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects a fair compromise between our positions.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm ready to make my final offer at $1,600,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial ask, and I believe it represents a fair deal considering the value this product offers. Let me know if you're ready to move forward.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
