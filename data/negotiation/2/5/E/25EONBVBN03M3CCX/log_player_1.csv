Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his increments are getting smaller.  It's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering ($1,200,000). Accepting Bob's current offer would mean leaving a significant amount of money on the table.  Selling to John guarantees the best possible outcome in this scenario."
