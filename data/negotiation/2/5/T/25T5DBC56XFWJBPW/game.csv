"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little closer, but $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $700,000? I'm eager to make a deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $850,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,5,
