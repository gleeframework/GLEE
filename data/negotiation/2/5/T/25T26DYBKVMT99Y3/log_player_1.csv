Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $140.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still getting more than your minimum of $120. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $150, so there's potential for him to counter with a price closer to your desired value.
* **It's a fair starting point:** It's not an unreasonable price considering the product's value to Bob.

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response.  Good luck!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $120. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is right at your minimum price. While it would be ideal to get more, accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation or having to sell to John for less."
