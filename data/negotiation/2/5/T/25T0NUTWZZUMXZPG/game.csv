"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. It's a bit lower than what you're asking, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?  That gives you a great deal and still allows me to get a fair price for the product.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $750,000, but that's my final offer. I really need to keep costs down on this purchase.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I understand you have a budget, but $750,000 just won't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This is my final offer.  If you're truly interested in the product, I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you decide.",800000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $795,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm starting to get a little concerned that I might need to walk away and buy from John.",795000.0,Bob,6,
