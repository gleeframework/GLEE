I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob. Even though I'm down to $13,000, I think I can squeeze a little more out of him."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Even though I'm getting closer to my minimum, I still think there's room for negotiation. I'll see if I can get him to go up a little more."

Round 9

I'm going to counter with $13,000. I'm getting a bit worried, but I still believe I can get a better deal than John's offer."

This is a tough one. I'm very close to my minimum, but I've also only got one round left. If I reject Bob's offer, I risk getting nothing at all.  I'm going to go with the guaranteed $10,000 from John. It's not ideal, but it's better than nothing."
