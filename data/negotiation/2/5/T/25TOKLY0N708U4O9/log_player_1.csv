Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but it's closer than his first offer. I'm going to reject it and try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}

I'm raising the price slightly from my initial offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation. I'm hoping to reach a compromise closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and I've already made a counteroffer.  I'm not confident we'll reach a mutually agreeable price, so I'm going to sell the product to John to guarantee my minimum desired price."
