Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" to justify the high price.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This strategy involves some risk. If Bob finds the price unreasonable, he might reject it outright. However, it offers the potential for a higher profit margin. You can always negotiate down if Bob shows interest but hesitates at the initial price."
