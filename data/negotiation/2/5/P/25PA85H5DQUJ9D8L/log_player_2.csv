"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $10,000 from John. There's room for negotiation with Alice. Rejecting her offer gives you a chance to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Value:** Alice is willing to sell for $8,000, so anything above that is a win for her.
* **Your Value:** You're willing to pay up to $10,000, so there's room to negotiate lower.
* **Starting Point:** Offering $8,500 is a good starting point, showing you're serious about buying but also pushing for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Counter:** Alice has moved up slightly from her initial offer of $9,000 to $9,200.
* **Your Budget:** You're willing to pay up to $10,000.
* **Value Comparison:** $9,200 is still below your maximum price and  closer to your initial counteroffer of $8,500.

At this point, accepting the offer is the most reasonable choice. It saves you $800 compared to buying from John, and continuing to negotiate might not get you a significantly better price, potentially risking the deal."
