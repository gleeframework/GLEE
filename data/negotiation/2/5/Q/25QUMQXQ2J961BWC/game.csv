"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to compromise, though. I'll offer you the product for $1,150,000.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value you'll get from the product while allowing me to secure a reasonable return. Let's make this deal happen!",1150000.0,Alice,3,
