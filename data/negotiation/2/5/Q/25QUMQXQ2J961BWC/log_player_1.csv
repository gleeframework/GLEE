Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset for your business.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's interests:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for him and highlighting the potential value of the product. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This gives Bob some wiggle room and encourages him to engage in the negotiation. 

**Important Note:**  This is just the initial offer.  My strategy will depend on Bob's response. I'm prepared to negotiate further or walk away if necessary to secure the best possible price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly below my desired outcome.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,200,000 at this point.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob has shown some willingness to negotiate, so it's worth exploring a counteroffer. I believe I can get him closer to my asking price.
* **John is a backup:**  Knowing I have John's offer of $1,500,000 gives me leverage in negotiations with Bob.  

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to get a price closer to $1,200,000. I'll be prepared to be flexible but won't settle for a price that significantly undervalues the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to compromise, though. I'll offer you the product for $1,150,000.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value you'll get from the product while allowing me to secure a reasonable return. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** I've lowered my price from $1,200,000 to $1,150,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Still above my minimum:**  This offer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Positive language:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to accept, highlighting the value he'll receive and emphasizing the potential for a successful deal. 

**Next Steps:** I'll be prepared to negotiate further if Bob rejects this counteroffer. I'm confident that I can reach an agreement with him, but I'll be ready to walk away and sell to John if the price falls too low."
