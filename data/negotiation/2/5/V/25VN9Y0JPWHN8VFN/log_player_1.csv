"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. I'm aware that Bob's value for the product is unknown, so I'm leaving room for negotiation. However, I want to establish a high baseline price from the start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room to negotiate and secure a better deal. I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still aiming for a profit significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping that by making a reasonable counteroffer, I can encourage Bob to continue negotiating and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now close to my target price and significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. There's a risk that he might lower his offer in subsequent rounds, but I'm willing to take the deal and secure a profit."
