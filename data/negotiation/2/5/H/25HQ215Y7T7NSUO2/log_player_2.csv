"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to you, but we're starting our negotiation at $120. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to propose a different price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good starting point, Bob can likely do better. He has a clear goal of saving as much money as possible, and rejecting the initial offer allows him to initiate a negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $100.  Would you be willing to consider $110?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible. By starting at $110, he's demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still staying within his desired budget.  This counteroffer also leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we aim for $125? This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit while remaining competitive. Please let me know if this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save money. While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price point of $100. He can continue to negotiate and try to push the price down further. Rejecting the offer allows him to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $125 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  Let's split the difference and go with $115.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing flexibility by offering a price that's a midpoint between his previous offer and Alice's current offer. This demonstrates a genuine effort to find a compromise while still remaining within his budget."
