"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is still a great deal for you, given the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground and reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $775,000. That's the best I can do. What do you think?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $775,000 just doesn't work for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $825,000. That's a fair price considering the value of the product and we can both walk away happy. What do you say?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $825,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to go down to $795,000. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",795000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting very close! I'm willing to come down to $800,000, my minimum price. This is a great deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this agreement and move forward.",800000.0,Alice,7,
