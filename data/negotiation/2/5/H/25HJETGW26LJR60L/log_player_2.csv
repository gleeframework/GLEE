"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be highly valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you for $1000000.  This is a one-time opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you're willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for the product, and John is selling it for that price, there's no incentive to accept Alice's offer.  You can get the same product from John for the same price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price with her or find another seller who is willing to offer a better deal."
