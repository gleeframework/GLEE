"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I have 9 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and selling to John is always an option if I can't get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1,000,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $1,300,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? That's a significant move on my part, showing I'm serious about buying. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  While Bob's offer is a step in the right direction, $1,150,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I have 6 rounds left, and I'm not desperate to sell to Bob. Selling to John is always an option if I can't get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $1,150,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers, but I need at least $1,250,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering its value and the potential it holds for you."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
