# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discussed, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000. I'm willing to make a concession to make this deal happen. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your target price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $900,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down, her final offer of $900,000 is still higher than John's guaranteed price of $800,000. It's unlikely Alice will go lower, and further negotiation may not yield a better result than John's offer."
