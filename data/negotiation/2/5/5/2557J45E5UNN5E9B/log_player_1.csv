Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $950,000.  This is a significant discount given its value to you.  I believe it's a fair price that allows for a profitable deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still get more from him or potentially from John.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that's too far below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This still leaves room for a healthy profit for you, and it's a price that reflects the true value of the product. Let's try to find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875000. I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still holding out for a higher price.  While $875,000 is better than John's offer, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you and I'm willing to compromise further.  How about $890,000?  This is a significant drop from my last offer and represents a solid deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal before we both miss out on a great opportunity."", ""product_price"": 890000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $890000. I'm willing to meet you at $885000. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $885,000 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $900,000, accepting this offer will still result in a good profit, and I'm not sure I can get a better price from Bob in the remaining rounds.  The risk of losing the deal to John is also a factor in my decision."
