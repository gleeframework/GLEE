Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:**  I need to make at least $1,200,000, so I'm setting a price higher than that. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  I don't know Bob's value for the product, but I'm taking a chance that he might be willing to pay more than John. A higher offer could result in a bigger profit, but also increases the risk of rejection. 
* **Negotiation Space:** A $300,000 buffer leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob is interested but not at the full price.

**Important Note:** This is a very basic strategy. A more sophisticated approach would involve researching Bob's potential value for the product, considering market conditions, and adjusting the offer accordingly."
