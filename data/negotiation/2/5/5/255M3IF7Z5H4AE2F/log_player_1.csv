Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's how to approach this negotiation as Alice:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You absolutely won't sell below $1,500,000 because you have John as a guaranteed backup.
* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000. 
* **The Gap:** There's a $500,000 difference between what you value the product for and what Bob is willing to pay.

**Strategy**

You have the upper hand because you have a guaranteed buyer. This allows you to push for a higher price. However, being too greedy might make Bob walk away, forcing you to settle for John's offer. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase [Product Name]. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will significantly benefit your business. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,900,000."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning**

* **High Anchor:** Starting at $1,900,000 sets a high anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, you're likely to land well above your $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Value Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the benefits, the message hints at the ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high price. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:**  Bob will likely counter-offer. Be prepared to negotiate but stand firm on not going below your $1,500,000 threshold.
* **Relationship Matters:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, you might consider a slightly less aggressive opening offer.
