"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for you, as the product is worth $800,000 to you.  It's a win-win situation!  If you decline, I'll be selling it to John for $1,500,000, so you have a chance to get it for a significantly lower price. Let me know your decision.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
