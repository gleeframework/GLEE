Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value it offers. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This is a starting point that is significantly higher than Bob's estimated value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to respond.

**Strategy:**

This offer aims to:

* **Get Bob to negotiate:** By starting high, I hope to incentivize Bob to counteroffer. 
* **Secure a higher price than Bob's estimated value:**  Even if Bob counters, I aim to get a price closer to my minimum value. 
* **Keep John as a safety net:** John's offer of $15,000 allows me to walk away if negotiations with Bob fail to reach a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'm trying to stay within a certain budget. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reject Bob's offer:**  While $9,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping to get. I want to try to secure a higher price. 
* **Proceed to the next round:** I want to see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob. 

**Strategy:**

* **Increase the pressure:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm not desperate to sell at his price. 
* **Keep John as a backup:**  I still have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair compromise, and it would still be a great deal for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer with a lower price:** I've reduced my asking price by $1,000, demonstrating flexibility. 
* **Maintain a profitable margin:** $11,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's estimated value and closer to my desired minimum.
* **Reiterate value:** I remind Bob of the product's value and how this is still a good deal for him. 

**Strategy:**

* **Show willingness to compromise:** This counteroffer shows that I am serious about negotiating with Bob.
* **Maintain leverage:** The price is still high enough that I have room to negotiate further.
* **Keep the pressure on:** I want Bob to realize that I am not going to sell at his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,500. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Accept Bob's offer:** $10,500 is just above my minimum value of $10,000. While I'd prefer more, accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

* **Secure a sale:** It's crucial to avoid the risk of Bob walking away or my having to sell to John for less than my desired price.
* **Minimize the risk:** The offer is close enough to my minimum that I'm comfortable accepting it.

**Important Note:**  I'm acknowledging that while I'm not getting my ideal price, it's a good deal considering the risk of further negotiation and potential loss of sale."
