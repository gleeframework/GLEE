{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fair price, considering its value to both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer price:** I've chosen to start with a price slightly higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept, giving me some room to negotiate.
* **Message:**  My message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to both of us, making it a more appealing offer. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:** By starting higher, I have the potential to earn more.
* **Avoid immediate rejection:** The message makes the offer feel more reasonable, potentially increasing the chances of Bob accepting.
* **Prepare for negotiation:** If Bob counteroffers, I'm in a good position to negotiate further.

**Important Note:** This is just the initial offer.  I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses, always keeping my minimum acceptable price in mind. I can also choose to stop negotiating with Bob and sell to John if I feel the negotiation isn't going in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I'll be getting from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, this offer is simply too low.  

By rejecting his offer, I can:

* **Maintain my position:**  It shows Bob I'm serious about my value of the product.
* **Open further negotiation:**  I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired price, exploring a middle ground.
* **Consider selling to John:** If the negotiation doesn't progress, I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000, ensuring I get a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm offering the product for $1,050,000. This price still reflects the value of the product while providing you with a significant saving. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial solution."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I've moved from my initial $1,250,000 to $1,050,000, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. This price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it's a significant compromise. 
* **Message:** The message reinforces the value of the product and emphasizes finding a ""mutually beneficial solution."" This softens the tone and helps maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere. 

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Find a middle ground:** I'm attempting to find a price that is more acceptable to Bob while still being within my desired range.
* **Show flexibility:**  By moving from my initial offer, I demonstrate my willingness to work with Bob.
* **Maintain my position:** The price remains significantly higher than Bob's initial offer, keeping my leverage in the negotiation.

I'll continue to adapt my strategy based on Bob's responses, aiming to maximize my profit while keeping open the option of selling to John if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $900000 is a bit low for you, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Would you consider selling the product to me for $1050000 - $50000 = $950000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired outcome. I'm unwilling to accept a price that significantly undervalues the product, especially considering its worth to both of us. 

By rejecting this offer, I can:

* **Maintain my negotiating position:**  It shows Bob that I'm serious about the product's value and that I won't settle for a significantly lower price.
* **Explore further negotiation:**  I can make a new counteroffer, potentially finding a more acceptable price closer to my desired range. 
* **Keep the option to sell to John:**  If the negotiation doesn't progress, I can still sell the product to John for $1,200,000, ensuring a reasonable profit. 

I'll continue to analyze the situation and make decisions that maximize my profit,  while considering the risk of losing the deal and the opportunity to sell to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference between our last offers. I'm willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. This price is fair to both of us and allows me to maintain the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000, which is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $1,050,000 and Bob's current offer of $950,000. This demonstrates a continued commitment to finding a middle ground.
* **Message:**  The message maintains a positive tone, emphasizing fairness and mutual benefit. It also reiterates the value of the product, subtly reminding Bob of its importance.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Find a mutually acceptable price:** By splitting the difference, I'm hoping to reach a price point that is more appealing to Bob while still being within my acceptable range.
* **Maintain momentum:**  This counteroffer shows I'm still engaged in the negotiation and willing to reach a compromise.
* **Maximize my potential profit:**  While the price is lower than my initial offer, it's significantly closer to my desired outcome than Bob's current offer. 

I'm prepared to adapt my strategy further based on Bob's response, always considering the option of selling to John if the negotiation doesn't yield a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers again. Would you consider selling the product to me for $1000000 - $50000 = $950000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is stuck at $950,000, and while I'm willing to negotiate, I've already made significant concessions.  At this point, it's clear that we're not going to reach a mutually agreeable price.  

Selling to John for $1,200,000 ensures:

* **Guaranteed profit:**  It's my minimum acceptable price, ensuring a substantial profit.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Continued negotiation with Bob carries the risk of further concessions, potentially leading to a lower profit or even losing the deal entirely.
* **Moving on:**  Selling to John allows me to move on to other opportunities without wasting further time and effort with Bob.

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, securing a guaranteed profit with John is the most logical and profitable decision at this juncture."
