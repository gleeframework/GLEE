Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially saving you significant resources in the long run. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering its potential worth."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, I want to see if I can get a higher price from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $950,000 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still offers him a substantial discount compared to my alternative sale ($1,000,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While unlikely, Bob might counter-offer, and this price gives me some wiggle room to potentially settle around $900,000."
