What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still very confident that this product will bring significant value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1150000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is still $1500000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're still hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1125000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is still $1500000. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above Bob's maximum value.  He's willing to pay up to $1,000,000.  There's no indication that Alice will go lower, and continuing to negotiate might lead to a stalemate.  Therefore, the most logical option is to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, ensuring Bob gets the best possible price within his budget."
