"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discussed, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $1000000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.
