Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $150.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Accounting for Bob's Valuation:**  While we know Bob values the product at $100, he might be willing to pay a premium if he believes it's worth it. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $100 provides a safety net. Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, we can still sell it at our minimum price. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters."
