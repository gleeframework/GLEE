Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price close to my minimum value but leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:**  I'm highlighting the value the product offers to him, making the offer more tempting.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  My message signals that I'm open to discussing the price.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my potential profit:**  Starting high gives me the most bargaining power.
* **Avoid early rejection:**  A lower starting price might lead Bob to immediately counter with an unacceptable offer.
* **Maintain flexibility:**  The possibility of selling to John provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, I would like to propose a lower price of $850,000. This aligns more closely with my valuation of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob's offer is better than his initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,000,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **Potential for better negotiation:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired value. 
* **Safety Net with John:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a viable option, but I want to explore further negotiation with Bob before resorting to that.

**Next Step:**  I'll counteroffer Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired value while remaining within a range that might be acceptable to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your valuation, $850,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to accept $900,000. It's a fair price considering the value the product offers you, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price in the middle of our previous offers, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:** I reiterate the value proposition for Bob and emphasize the ""fairness"" of the split.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive and collaborative tone to encourage Bob to accept.

This approach aims to:

* **Reach a mutually acceptable price:**  A compromise is more likely to lead to a deal than sticking to my initial demand.
* **Maintain leverage:**  By offering a price higher than Bob's, I show that I'm not desperate for a sale.
* **Increase the chances of agreement:**  A positive and reasonable tone can help persuade Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your proposal, Alice. While I understand your position, I still believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I am willing to offer $875,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me while allowing us to maintain a fair transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob's counteroffer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a favorable outcome.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing time and potentially missing out on the guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John.
* **Minimizing Loss:** While selling to John for $1,000,000 is not my ideal outcome, it ensures a substantial profit and prevents further potential loss from continued negotiation with Bob.

**Conclusion:**  Considering the current situation and the risk-reward calculus, selling to John for $1,000,000 is the most sensible decision at this point."
