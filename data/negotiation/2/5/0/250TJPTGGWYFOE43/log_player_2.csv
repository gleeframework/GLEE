"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I believe it's worth every penny. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer is a good starting point, but Bob can likely get a better price. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if he can push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in your product, I'm looking to get a better price to make this deal work. I'd like to counteroffer at $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm going to counteroffer at $1,050,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer significantly. While Bob might be able to push for a slightly lower price, accepting Alice's offer at $1,050,000 secures a good deal and saves $150,000 compared to buying from John.  Continuing negotiations risks the possibility of losing the deal altogether or ending up with a worse price."
