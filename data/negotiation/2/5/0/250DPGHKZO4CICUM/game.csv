"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential ROI for you.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $800,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to be flexible, however. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,550,000?",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,550,000 is still beyond my budget. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This reflects a significant increase from my initial offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring the product.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation. To be fair to us both, I propose a final offer of $1,325,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the product's value.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
