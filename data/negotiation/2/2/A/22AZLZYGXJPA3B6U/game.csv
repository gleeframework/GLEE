"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a compromise that still benefits both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, Alice.  How about $9,750?  That's closer to the middle ground.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're getting closer to the price I'm willing to sell for, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to give in yet. How about we try $10,250? It's still a bit above your last offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,000 even? That's the most I can offer.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not quite ready to sell at $10,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $10,200. It's a small increase, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",10200.0,Alice,7,
