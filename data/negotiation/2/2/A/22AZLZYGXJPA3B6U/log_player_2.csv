Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not quite ready to sell at $10,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $10,200. It's a small increase, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:

At this point, it's unlikely Alice will go much lower. Accepting $10,200 is a reasonable compromise to avoid the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John for $12,000."
