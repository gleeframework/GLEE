"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what I'd get from another buyer. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget and I'm trying to get the best deal possible.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a limited budget, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a great deal for you. It's closer to your budget, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,000,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $980,000. Can you consider that?",980000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $980,000 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000, which is a fair compromise. This way, we both can get a good deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not sure if $1,050,000 is the best deal for me. I'm willing to go up to $990,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",990000.0,Bob,6,
