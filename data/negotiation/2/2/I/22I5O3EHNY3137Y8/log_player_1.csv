Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy my product before I list it publicly.  I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $120. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a little higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:**  While not essential, hinting that the product might be available elsewhere (public listing) can sometimes encourage a buyer.
* **Politeness:** A friendly and approachable tone is more likely to get a positive response. 
 
**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this offer, Alice still has a guaranteed sale at $100 to John.  This safety net allows Alice to be a bit bolder in her initial ask."
