"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you! I'm asking for $12,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but still below what the product is worth to Bob. This gives him room to negotiate but also shows I value the product.  I'm aiming for a win-win scenario where we both feel good about the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum of $8,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to sell for less than my bottom line. I'm going to try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be compensated fairly. How about $10,000? This is a great deal for both of us and ensures we're both happy with the transaction."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about $9,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is above my minimum of $8,000 and closer to my desired price.  While it's not my ideal outcome, it's a good deal and I'm confident I can get a better price in future negotiations if I reject it."
