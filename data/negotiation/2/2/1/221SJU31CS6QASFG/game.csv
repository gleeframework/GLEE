"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $10000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. Can you consider this price point?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $14000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still looking to stay within my budget of $10000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11500. Can you consider this price point?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $11500. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $13000. This is my final offer within the range I'm comfortable with, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the product.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, but I'm still not comfortable going above $10000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised you're still willing to go up to $10500, but I'm not willing to meet you at that price. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm at my lowest comfortable price point. I'm counteroffering at $16000, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value. This is my last serious offer, and I expect a more substantial price for the product.",16000.0,Alice,7,
