Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150."",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you should aim higher with Bob to potentially earn more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $150 allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially settling on a price higher than $100.
* **Avoid Appearing Desperate:** Offering it at $100 immediately might make Bob think it's worth less or that you're desperate to sell.

It's a balancing act.  You want to maximize your potential earnings from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough that he doesn't reject it outright."
