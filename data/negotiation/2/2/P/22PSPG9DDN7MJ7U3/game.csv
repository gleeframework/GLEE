I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to let it go for $18000. What do you think?,18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $16000 is still a bit too rich for my blood. I'm willing to pay $14000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're a serious buyer, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to compromise at $16500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal.",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think that this product might not be worth the investment at this price. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to a mutually agreeable price. I'll make one final offer: $13500. If that's not acceptable, I'll consider buying from John for $10000",13500.0,Bob,6,
