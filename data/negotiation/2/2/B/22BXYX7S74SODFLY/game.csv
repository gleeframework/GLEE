"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I appreciate your offer, $750,000 is unfortunately below what I can accept.  However, I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to reflect your interest. This price still allows me to cover my costs and gives you a substantial discount on my original asking price. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable paying $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825,000. Can you consider this price?",825000.0,Bob,4,
