# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us, allowing me to make a good profit while offering you a significant discount from my true value. Let me know what you think.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I appreciate your offer, $750,000 is unfortunately below what I can accept.  However, I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to reflect your interest. This price still allows me to cover my costs and gives you a substantial discount on my original asking price. What do you think?
