Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us, allowing me to make a good profit while offering you a significant discount from my true value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $900,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential benefit for both parties. This helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider my offer seriously. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Secure a good deal:**  $900,000 is a strong starting point, giving me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Avoid unnecessary delays:**  By starting with a reasonable offer, I avoid wasting time on lowball offers from Bob.
* **Keep John as a backup:**  My fallback option of selling to John for $1,000,000 ensures I have a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $750,000 is a decent offer, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I believe I can get a better price by continuing negotiations.  

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  
* **Focus on value:** I'll emphasize the product's true value and the potential benefits for Bob.
* **Maintain the safety net:**  The option to sell to John for $1,000,000 ensures I don't settle for an unacceptable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I appreciate your offer, $750,000 is unfortunately below what I can accept.  However, I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to reflect your interest. This price still allows me to cover my costs and gives you a substantial discount on my original asking price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable paying $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $825,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  While I would prefer a higher price, it's important to weigh the potential of a prolonged negotiation against the risk of losing the deal entirely.  Accepting his offer allows me to secure a sale and earn a decent profit.

**Strategy:**

* **Minimizing Risk:**  Continuing negotiations could lead to a stalemate or even a lower offer from Bob. Accepting his offer eliminates this risk and ensures a sale.
* **Time Value:**  Negotiating further might consume valuable time, which could be better spent on other opportunities.
* **Balance of Profit:**  $825,000 is a significant profit and allows me to achieve a good outcome while maintaining a positive relationship with Bob."
