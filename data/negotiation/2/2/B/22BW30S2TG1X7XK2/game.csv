"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. Given the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the potential for both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective, $850,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a very fair price for both of us. This offer reflects a significant compromise on my end and I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering the value you've placed on the product, I believe $875,000 is a fair price that reflects a win-win for both of us. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $875,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $885,000. This price reflects the value of the product while still giving you a significant opportunity to profit. Let's close this deal and move forward.",885000.0,Alice,5,
