Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. Given the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the potential for both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you think?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
