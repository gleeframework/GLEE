Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to earn as much as possible. Since I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 from John, I need to aim higher with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $11,999 is a strong starting point, offering slightly below my guaranteed price leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate upwards if he's particularly interested. 
* **Urgency and Value:** My message to Bob subtly implies urgency (limited-time offer) and emphasizes value, hoping to sway him towards a quick purchase. 

By starting high, I increase my chances of either securing a sale close to my maximum value or falling back on my guaranteed offer from John."
