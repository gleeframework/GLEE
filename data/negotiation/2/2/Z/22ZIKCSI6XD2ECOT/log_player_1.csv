{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $115."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price above my minimum ($120) but also leaving room for negotiation to make a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum, so I will reject it. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is still a great deal for you, and allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm still aiming for a price above my minimum, but I'm willing to negotiate a bit further. I believe $110 is a fair price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I value your product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to go beyond $100 for the product. Would you be open to meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum.  While I could keep negotiating, I've already gone down in price, and there is a risk of going back and forth without reaching a deal. I know I can get my minimum price from John, so I'm going to sell to him."
