"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,500. This is a great price considering its value to you is $15,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,500 isn't a terrible price, you can potentially get a better deal. Alice is clearly motivated to sell and knows you value the product. By rejecting her first offer, you might encourage her to come down closer to her own valuation of $12,000."
