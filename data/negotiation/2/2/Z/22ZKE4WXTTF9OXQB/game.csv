"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting point. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $650,000 is significantly below the product's value. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $725,000. Would that be agreeable to you?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price, but $725,000 is still significantly lower than the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers.  Would you consider $787,500?",787500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts in finding a mutually agreeable price. However, $787,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a fair offer, considering the value of the product, and I hope we can finalize the deal.",825000.0,Alice,7,
