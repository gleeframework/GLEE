"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at $800,000 to me, and I'm confident it will be equally valuable to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's potential. Let me know your thoughts!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it. I believe that's a fair offer considering its value to me.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your offer. However, $650,000 is significantly below the value I've placed on it.  I'm willing to come down to $750,000,  which is still a fair price considering its potential. This would be a win-win for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $750,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,
