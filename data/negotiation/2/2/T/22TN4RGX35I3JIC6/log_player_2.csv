# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,050,000. It's worth $1,000,000 to you, so this is a great opportunity to acquire it for a modest premium. Let me know if you're interested, but please respond quickly as I have other potential buyers.

It's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John for $1,000,000. Even though it's a higher price, it's still lower than what Alice is asking. You are trying to save as much money as possible."
