Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}

I'm starting with a high price of $9,000. This gives me a good starting point and leaves room for negotiation. It's also above Bob's estimated value of $8,000, which may motivate him to negotiate."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $8,500. This is still above Bob's initial offer, but closer to my minimum value. I'm hoping this shows flexibility and encourages Bob to come closer to my desired price."
