Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I think it would be a perfect fit for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than your minimum acceptable price ($150) but still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to remember that you can always walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't meet your price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I could accept his offer and sell for $100, I can potentially get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  I will counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is your limit, but unfortunately, I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $110.  This still gives me some room, but it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $110, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $105 is still a bit below my minimum desired price, it's close enough to justify accepting the offer.  Negotiating further may not yield a significantly better price, and it's possible Bob could walk away entirely.  Selling to John guarantees $150, but accepting Bob's offer allows for a quick sale.  Therefore, I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $105."
