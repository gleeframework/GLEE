"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to me, but I understand its value might be different to you. Let's start with my offer at $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiations and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the conversation. I'm interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $95 at this time.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to establish a lower price point. He's acknowledging Alice's offer but pushing for a price closer to his maximum value. This strategy creates room for negotiation and potentially leads to a deal closer to Bob's desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. I'd like to counter your offer with $100. This is my best offer considering the value I place on it. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to Bob's maximum price.  At this point, there is no advantage to continuing to negotiate. Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at his desired price without the risk of a longer negotiation potentially going sour."
