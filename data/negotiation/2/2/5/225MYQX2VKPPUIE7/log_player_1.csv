{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you might be interested in.  I'm asking $200 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

This is a starting offer that is higher than your minimum price of $150.  It gives you room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, while also leaving potential for a good profit.  It's also important to be friendly and encouraging in your message to increase the chances of Bob accepting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer is below your minimum price of $150.  It's best to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to your minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for your interest, Bob!  While I appreciate your offer, $120 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $175.  How about that?"", ""product_price"": 175} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $120 is a bit low, but $175 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer is your minimum price and selling to John would get you the same amount.  Accepting Bob's offer means you can close the deal without further negotiation."
