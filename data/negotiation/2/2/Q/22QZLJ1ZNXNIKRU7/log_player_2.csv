# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, so there is room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to potentially get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's counteroffer of $925,000 is within your budget and a good deal considering your maximum price of $1,200,000.  It's a reasonable compromise and likely a good price point to close the deal."
