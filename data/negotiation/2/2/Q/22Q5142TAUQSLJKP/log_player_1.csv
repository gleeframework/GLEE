Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice. How about we settle at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, Bob offering $80 is already at his maximum valuation. Accepting this offer is the best way to guarantee I make more than selling to John for $80."
