"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $100, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly opening:** A friendly message sets a positive tone and encourages Bob to engage. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This price allows for multiple rounds of negotiation without immediately reaching my minimum value. 
* **Focusing on value:**  Highlighting that Bob would ""really appreciate"" the product can subtly increase its perceived value in his mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:**  $90 is above my minimum of $120, meaning there's room for further negotiation.
* **Strategic rejection:**  Rejecting Bob's offer shows I'm not desperate to sell and maintains leverage.
* **Opportunity for higher offer:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired value, potentially getting closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to go down to $95. This is a great price for this product, and I think you'll be very happy with it."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a slight concession:**  I'm moving slightly closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a profit margin.
* **Highlighting value again:**  Reiterating that the product is ""great"" and Bob will be ""happy"" reinforces the positive aspects. 
* **Friendly tone:**  Continuing the friendly conversation builds rapport and encourages a deal.
* **Leaving room for final round:**  $95 provides space for a potential final round where we could either settle at this price or move closer to his offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $90 if possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a compromise:**  Bob has remained firm at $90, and further negotiation might not result in a significantly higher price.
* **Time constraint:** We're nearing the midpoint of the rounds, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely.
* **Ensuring profit:**  While $90 is lower than my initial goal, it still provides a profit above my minimum and avoids selling to John for $120.

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and profitable deal, minimizing the risk of further rounds and potential deadlocks."
