Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.  He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. Any price within this range could potentially benefit both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high within the ZOPA but leave some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal.  Going too close to $1,200,000 increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth in the market."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You highlight the ""exclusive opportunity"" to add perceived value.
* **Justification:** Mentioning ""unique value and potential"" subtly reinforces the product's worth.
* **Strategic Price:** $1,350,000 is a strong starting point within the ZOPA, giving you room to negotiate if Bob counters.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to negotiate. If he rejects this initial offer, be ready to counter-offer, but never go below your $1,500,000 minimum."
