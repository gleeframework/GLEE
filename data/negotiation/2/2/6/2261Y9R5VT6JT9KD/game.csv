"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you seeing the value in this product. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $12,000 for it.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still a little hesitant at $13,000. Would you be willing to come down to $12,500?  I think that's a fair price that would allow us both to walk away happy.",12500.0,Bob,4,
