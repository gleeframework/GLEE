Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I believe it will be very valuable for you."", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** While Bob values the product at $100, it's best to start with a price higher than that. This leaves room for negotiation or for Bob to accept a price higher than his initial valuation.
* **Staying below John's offer:**  Offering it at $125 ensures that if Bob declines, you're still getting a better price from John ($150).
* **Justification:** Offering a ""special price"" attempts to create a sense of value and urgency for Bob."
