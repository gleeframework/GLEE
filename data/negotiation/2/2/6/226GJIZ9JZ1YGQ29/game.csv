"Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table. While your offer is generous, the value this product holds goes beyond that. How about we meet halfway at $1,900,000? This reflects the true potential of what we're discussing.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but your offer is still significantly below what I believe is a fair price for this product.  To move this forward, I'd need to see a more substantial jump.  How about $1,850,000?  This feels like a reasonable compromise considering the value at stake.",1850000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I've been flexible and tried to find common ground, but your offers haven't reflected the true value of this product. I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,800,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I need you to meet me halfway for us to make a deal.",1800000.0,Alice,7,
