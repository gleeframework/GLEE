Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. This is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and potentially reaches a price that is acceptable for both of us.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This initial offer gives me the space to negotiate downwards if Bob counters. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, so this offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest without risking losing out on that guaranteed amount. 

I'm hoping that by starting high, I can get Bob to counter-offer, and we can reach a price that is mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $850,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. Accepting would result in a major loss.
* **Negotiation Continues:** I want to continue negotiating with Bob. While his initial offer was very low, there's still a potential to reach a middle ground. 
* **John is a Safety Net:** I'm still comfortable with selling to John for $1,500,000, so I have no immediate pressure to accept Bob's offer.

I will counter-offer with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moving Towards a Middle Ground:** My counteroffer of $1,200,000 is a significant decrease from my initial offer of $1,400,000, showing my willingness to compromise. It's also well above Bob's initial offer of $850,000. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to meet me halfway.  
* **Still Above My Minimum:**  I'm still above my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000, so I'm not risking a substantial loss if Bob rejects this offer.

I believe this counteroffer is a fair starting point for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** While Bob has increased his offer to $900,000, it's still far below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is Stalling:** Bob's counteroffers are not demonstrating a willingness to meet my expectations.  
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:**  It's becoming increasingly clear that negotiating with Bob will be a lengthy and uncertain process. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired profit, and I don't want to risk losing out on that certainty.

It's time to secure the guaranteed profit by selling to John."
