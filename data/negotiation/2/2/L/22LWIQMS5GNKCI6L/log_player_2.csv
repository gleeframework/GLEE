"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm aiming to sell it for $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000.  It's not even close to a reasonable starting point for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is quite a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8,000 is significantly below its value. I could meet you halfway at $11,500. This offer stands as a compromise to get us both what we want. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a better offer than Alice's initial one, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price of $8,000.  Rejecting this offer allows me to counteroffer again and potentially reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get a decent amount and allowing me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $10,250? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,250 is getting closer to my target price, it's still above my budget. I am willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price of $8,000. Rejecting this offer allows me to counteroffer again and potentially reach a more agreeable price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the continued effort to find a compromise.  While I appreciate your offer, $10,250 is still a bit too high for me.
