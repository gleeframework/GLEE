Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm aiming to sell it for $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is quite a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8,000 is significantly below its value. I could meet you halfway at $11,500. This offer stands as a compromise to get us both what we want."", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to get a decent amount and allowing me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $10,250? This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 10250}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the continued effort to find a compromise.  While I appreciate your offer, $10,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500 to show my commitment to buying this product.  Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.
