{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $119. It's a great deal you won't want to miss!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120. 
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:** You have a backup offer from John for $100.

By offering the product to Bob at $119, you are maximizing your potential profit while still ensuring Bob gets a deal that's attractive enough for him to accept. If Bob rejects your offer, you can always sell to John for your minimum acceptable price."
