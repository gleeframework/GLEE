"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, but still below Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is a decent offer, I'm aiming for more. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round but am still holding out for a significant profit.  By meeting him halfway, I hope to encourage Bob to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better price.  While $900,000 is tempting, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm adjusting my offer again, coming closer to Bob's price but still aiming for a reasonable profit. This should incentivize Bob to accept, as it's a compromise from both sides."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. While $925,000 is getting close to my minimum, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm getting closer to Bob's last offer and I believe this is a reasonable compromise that could lead to a deal.  It's just slightly more than his last offer and significantly more than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get more, I'm starting to run out of time. Bob's offer is reasonable, and I'm confident I can't squeeze much more out of him.  It's also significantly more than what I'd get from John. I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
