"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $850,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $750,000? I believe that's a fair offer that reflects the value while working for me.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.
