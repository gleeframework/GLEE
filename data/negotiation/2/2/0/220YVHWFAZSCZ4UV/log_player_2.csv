Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.

This seems to be a good point to accept the offer. Alice has indicated this is her lowest price. Continuing to negotiate might push her away, and buying from John would mean spending more. Getting the product for $800,000 is a decent saving."
