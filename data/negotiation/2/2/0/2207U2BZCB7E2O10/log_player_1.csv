Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get out of it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I still think the product is a bit overpriced. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but no more. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 6

While Bob is getting closer to the million mark, we still have rounds to spare and can likely push him a bit further before going to John."

Round 8
Bob's offer:

Bob seems to be stuck at $1,225,000. It's unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer in the next two rounds. Taking the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John is the safest option at this point."
