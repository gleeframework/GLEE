"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. I'm initially offering it at $1,500,000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get out of it.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to find a buyer, the value of this product is quite significant. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I still think the product is a bit overpriced. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but no more. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,225,000? I think this is a fair compromise.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
