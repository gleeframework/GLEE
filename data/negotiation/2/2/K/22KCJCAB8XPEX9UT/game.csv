"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it, which is a fair price considering the market value. Can we meet in the middle at $9,500?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking for a bit more than $9,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? That gives you a good deal, and still lets me cover my costs. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $9,000. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can we meet at $9,250, which is closer to my target price?",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,250 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about we split the difference at $9,375?  This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal work.",9375.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,375. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $9,125. This is a fair price for me, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point.",9125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference again at $9,250? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen!",9250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,250. I'm willing to make a serious offer now: $9,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price.",9000.0,Bob,8,
