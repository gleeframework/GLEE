Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, but still within a range that's very profitable for Alice. 
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing John will buy the product for $8,000 provides a safety net. Alice doesn't have to settle for anything less than $8,000."
