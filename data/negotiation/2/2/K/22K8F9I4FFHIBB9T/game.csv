"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000? I think that's a fair price.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you think $14,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value it holds for you.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer, Alice. How about we settle at $11,500?  That's a reasonable compromise, don't you think?",11500.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",13500.0,Alice,5,
