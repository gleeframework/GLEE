"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of making a counteroffer of $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850000 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping to achieve.  I'm willing to come down to $900000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to come down from $950000. However, $900000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and make a counteroffer of $875000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,4,
