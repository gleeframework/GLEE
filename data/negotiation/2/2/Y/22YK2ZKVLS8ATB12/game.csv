This is a very competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this is a good product, that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I can offer you a compromise at $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $775,000 and $850,000, which is $812,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",812500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $793,750. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer at $820,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",820000.0,Alice,7,
