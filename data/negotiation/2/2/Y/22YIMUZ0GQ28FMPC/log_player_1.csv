Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while staying above our minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting us closer to our desired profit.
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing we have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John gives us leverage. We're not desperate to sell to Bob at any cost. 

This strategy balances maximizing potential profit from Bob while ensuring we don't lose out on the guaranteed sale to John."
