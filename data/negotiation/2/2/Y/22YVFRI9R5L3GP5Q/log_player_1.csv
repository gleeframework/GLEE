"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I know how valuable it would be for you, so I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with an ambitious offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a high profit.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob and uses positive language to encourage a favorable response.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** We understand this is the first round and expect potential counteroffers. By starting high, we signal our desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good offer, we're still in the early stages of negotiation. Bob's initial counteroffer confirms the product's high value to him. We have room to negotiate further and aim for a price closer to $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the value of this product is significantly higher. Would you consider $1,250,000? This feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We're moving closer to Bob's offer but staying firm on a price above $1,200,000.
* **Justification:** We're subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the higher price.
* **Compromise Language:** Using phrases like ""fair compromise"" encourages agreement without appearing overly aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I still think $1,250,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,175,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:**  $1,175,000 is a solid offer and represents a significant profit above our minimum acceptable price. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, and this offer demonstrates his seriousness. Holding out for more might risk losing the deal.
* **Time Value:**  While we have rounds remaining, closing the deal now provides certainty and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away in later rounds."
