"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but you can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting allows you to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 might be a bit high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $875,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.

Alice's counteroffer is closer to your ideal price, but you can still push for a better deal. You are willing to pay less than $875,000, and Alice is unlikely to walk away from a deal at that price point.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter with a price lower than $875,000."

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is a fair price considering your maximum budget and the potential cost of buying from John.  While you could continue negotiating, it's likely that you won't be able to get a significantly lower price from Alice.  It's better to secure this deal and save a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
