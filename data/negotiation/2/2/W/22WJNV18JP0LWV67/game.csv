"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 might be a bit high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $875,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $825,000 for the product.  This would be a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $825,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to offer the product for $850,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",850000.0,Alice,5,
