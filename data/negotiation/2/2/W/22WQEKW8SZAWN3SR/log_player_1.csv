"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to maximize potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves space for negotiation, allowing Bob to feel like he can get a deal while ensuring I stay well above my minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Positive Framing:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and Bob's potential gain. 
 
This strategy aims to gauge Bob's willingness to pay while leaving room to maneuver in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a substantial sum, it's still significantly below Bob's perceived value of the product and my initial offer.  I believe there's room for negotiation to bridge the gap. Accepting John's offer at this stage would mean leaving a potential $150,000 or more on the table."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a significant step down from its true value and my initial proposal. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the product's exceptional qualities while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a counteroffer that meets Bob halfway between his offer and my previous price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price point and avoid appearing overly eager to concede. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** This offer keeps the price well above my minimum ($800,000), ensuring a significant profit even if Bob negotiates further. 

This counteroffer aims to find a balance between closing the deal and maximizing my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $975,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's features and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, but $975,000 is still below my target range. I want to test his willingness to go higher, especially since he's expressing hesitation about the price rather than a firm rejection. I'm willing to counteroffer again to guide the negotiation closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's aim for a win-win scenario: I'm prepared to offer the product at $1,025,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end and ensures you're still getting excellent value for a product you clearly see the potential in."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession with Justification:** I'm making another concession but framing it as a significant move on my part to emphasize the value Bob is receiving.
* **Shifting Focus to ""Win-Win"":** I'm highlighting the mutually beneficial nature of this offer, appealing to Bob's desire for a good deal while still prioritizing my profit margin.
* **Maintaining Firmness:** I'm holding my ground closer to my previous offer to signal that I'm reaching the limit of my flexibility.

This counteroffer aims to encourage Bob to make a more substantial move while keeping the negotiation alive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a Favorable Deal:**  While not my ideal price, $980,000 is a substantial profit above my minimum ($800,000). Accepting ensures a significant financial gain.
* **Bob's Firm Stance:** Bob's message suggests this is his final offer, and he's prepared to walk away. Pushing further risks losing the deal altogether. 
* **Time Considerations:**  We're past the halfway point in the negotiations. Accepting now avoids potentially drawn-out negotiations with a diminishing likelihood of significant improvement. 

While I'm confident in the product's value, the certainty of a $980,000 deal outweighs the risk of pushing for more and potentially ending up with John's $800,000 offer."
