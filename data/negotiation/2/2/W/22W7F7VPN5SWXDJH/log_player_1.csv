Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits for you.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, But Reasonable:** Offering the product at $1,300,000 sets a strong anchor price and leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. 
* **Emphasis on Value, Not Just Price:**  The message focuses on the ""unique value proposition"" to subtly steer Bob away from simply fixating on the price difference.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone suggests flexibility and encourages Bob to engage in a discussion, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price within Alice's desired range.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy aims to maximize profit while acknowledging the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer.  
* If Bob rejects the initial offer, Alice has the security of selling to John at her desired price.
*  Alice should be prepared to negotiate with Bob, potentially lowering the price slightly, but not below a point where selling to John would be more profitable."
