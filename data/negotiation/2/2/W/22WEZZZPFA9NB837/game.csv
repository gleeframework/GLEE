"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80. Would that work for you?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $180 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $120? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. $120 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something a little more budget-friendly. Would you consider $95? That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to buy if you're happy with it.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a more budget-friendly option, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $95. How about we meet at $110? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",110.0,Alice,5,
