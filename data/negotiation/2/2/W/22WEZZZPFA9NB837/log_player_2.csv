"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's starting offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80. Would that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 80} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start Low:**  Negotiating is about finding a middle ground. Starting significantly lower than your actual budget ($100) gives you room to negotiate upwards while still potentially getting a great deal. 
* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:** This counteroffer will help you understand how willing Alice is to negotiate. If she outright rejects $80, you know you might need to increase your offers significantly. 
* **John as Leverage:** Remember, you always have the option to walk away and buy from John for $100. This knowledge gives you power in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $180 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $120? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While $120 is closer to your budget, it's still above what you're willing to pay.  Let's see if Alice is willing to come down a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. $120 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something a little more budget-friendly. Would you consider $95? That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to buy if you're happy with it."", ""product_price"": 95}

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Increase:** We're moving closer to your budget in smaller increments to show Alice you're serious but still looking for a good deal.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By stating you're ""ready to buy,"" you add a bit of pressure and imply that this is a serious offer. 
* **Staying Below John's Price:**  It's crucial to remain below $100 to ensure you're getting a better deal with Alice than your alternative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking for a more budget-friendly option, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $95. How about we meet at $110? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly holding firm above $100.  At this point, it's not worth continuing the negotiation. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $100 from John, which meets your budget.  It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and take the sure thing."
