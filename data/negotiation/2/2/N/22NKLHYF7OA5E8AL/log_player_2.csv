Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more adjustment. I'll sell it to you for $815,000. This is a final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I think we can make a deal. What do you think?

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **We're close to Alice's limit:** Alice has stated this is her final offer. While she might be bluffing, there's a good chance she won't go much lower.
* **Significant savings:**  We'll be buying the product for $815,000, a significant savings compared to John's $1,500,000 price tag.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns. We might be able to get the price down a little more, but we risk Alice walking away or not budging much, forcing us to buy from John anyway."
