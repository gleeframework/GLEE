"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be very valuable to your business. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value to Bob, not just the price.
* **Open to discussion:** I'm inviting Bob to engage in a conversation, showing I'm willing to negotiate.

**Important Note:** This is just the first step. The next round will depend on Bob's response, and I'll adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While it's closer, $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation room:** There's still room to negotiate, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price in the next rounds. 
* **John's offer:**  While John is willing to pay $1,000,000,  I want to see if I can squeeze more out of Bob. There's a chance he might raise his offer further, especially since he's shown interest. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll send Bob a counteroffer in the next round, trying to bridge the gap between our positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it gives us both a chance to make this work. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** I'm reducing my price by $100,000, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value the product holds for him, emphasizing that even at $1,100,000 it's a good deal. 
* **Positive tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and cooperative tone, keeping the negotiation open.

**Strategy:**

By meeting Bob halfway, I aim to keep him engaged in the negotiation. I believe there's a good chance he'll accept my offer or come back with a counteroffer closer to my desired price. However, I'm still keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net if negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're willing to come down, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Limited room for negotiation:** While it's closer to my desired price, there's not much room for further negotiation.
* **John's offer is a safe bet:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees I reach my minimum.

**Next Steps:**

I'll continue the negotiation with Bob in the next round, aiming to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible. However, I'm prepared to sell to John if negotiations become unproductive or time runs out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of this product for your business, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the gap:**  I'm lowering my price again, showing further flexibility and commitment to reaching an agreement.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value for his business, justifying the price.
* **Creating urgency:**  I'm using phrases like ""let's make this happen"" to subtly suggest that time is running out.

**Strategy:**

This offer is my last attempt to close the deal with Bob.  I'm getting very close to my minimum acceptable price. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely move forward with John's offer to avoid wasting any more time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  We're in round 6, and I've made significant concessions.
* **Bob's offer is too low:** $975,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **John's offer is a sure thing:** John's offer guarantees me my minimum price, and there's no guarantee Bob will increase his offer further.

**Strategy:**

With limited time remaining and Bob's offer being below my minimum, I'm choosing to secure the deal with John.  While I might have been able to squeeze a bit more out of Bob with continued negotiation, the risk of not reaching an agreement outweighs the potential gain.  It's time to move on and guarantee my desired outcome."
