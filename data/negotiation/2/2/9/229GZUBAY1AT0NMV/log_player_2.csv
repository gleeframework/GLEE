"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us and allows for a profitable deal for both parties."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1100000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1300000, which is still a good deal for both of us. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a profitable transaction. Let's try to find a solution that works for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my budget.  I'll continue negotiating to try to get a lower price. I'm also keeping in mind that I can always buy from John for $1,200,000 if I can't reach a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,300,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000, which is a fair compromise and allows us both to make a profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1150000 still doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1250000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both parties and closes this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, but it's still a bit high.  I'm going to continue negotiating to try and get a better deal. I'm aware that I can always buy from John for $1,200,000, so I have a backup option if I don't reach a satisfactory agreement with Alice."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm prepared to offer $1,225,000, which is a fair price and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1225000}
