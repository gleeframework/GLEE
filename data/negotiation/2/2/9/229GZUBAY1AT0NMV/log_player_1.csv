Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us and allows for a profitable deal for both parties.

I will reject Bob's offer. Although I want to close the deal, selling for $1,100,000 is too low for me. I will counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1300000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1150000, which is a fair compromise and allows us both to make a profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

I will reject Bob's offer. While I am tempted to sell at this point, I feel that I can still achieve a better price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 still doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I would prefer a higher price, $1,225,000 is a good deal and ensures a profitable sale. It's also close to what John would pay, so it's worth it to close the deal with Bob."
