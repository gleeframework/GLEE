This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a higher price, but I'm also aware that I have a fallback option with John.  Let's see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I want to get the best price possible, I'm not willing to settle for that amount. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still holding firm at a value that's reasonable for me.  I believe this counteroffer is fair and gives Bob a chance to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to what I'm willing to accept, I'm still not comfortable settling for that price. I'm going to counteroffer one more time and see if we can reach an agreement.  If not, I'll go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

```

I'm making one final counteroffer, hoping to meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it gives Bob a fair chance to buy the product at a price that works for him.  If he rejects this, I'll move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've decided to sell the product to John.  While I'd love to get a higher price, Bob's last offer was too low, and I'm not interested in continuing this back and forth.  John's offer is a solid guarantee, and I'm happy to move forward with the sale."
