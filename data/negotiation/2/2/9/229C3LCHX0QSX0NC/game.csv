"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1100000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, but I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1100000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product.  This is still a significant amount for me, and I believe it's a fair price given my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000,  which is still a significant discount from its true value to me.  This is my final offer, and if you're not comfortable with it, I will have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to get a good price, but $1000000 is still outside my budget. I can go up to $950000, which is a significant investment for me. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950000 is still not quite enough for me. I'm willing to compromise one last time and offer the product for $975000.  This is a very fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested.",975000.0,Alice,5,
