"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $7500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $9000 for this. It's still a great deal for you, as you're getting it for less than half its value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $9000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8200. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to stay within my budget.",8200.0,Bob,4,
