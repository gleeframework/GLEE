Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $125. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $125, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly approach:** I'm using a friendly tone and emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message leaves the door open for Bob to counteroffer, allowing me to adjust the price if needed. 

**Strategy:** 

I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum value ($150) as possible. However, I'm also aware that Bob might walk away, so I need to be prepared to negotiate and potentially accept a lower price.  If the negotiation drags on or Bob makes unacceptable counteroffers, I'll be ready to switch to John, who is guaranteed to pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $125 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $112.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still below my target.  I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation.
* **Potential for higher price:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer closer to my minimum. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing that John is willing to pay $150, I'm not under pressure to accept a low price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price that's closer to my target value but still within a reasonable range. I'll likely offer something between $112.50 and $125."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $112.50 is a good starting point.  Let's split the difference and see if we can agree on $118.75.  That way, we both get a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 118.75}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I've proposed a price that's halfway between Bob's last offer ($112.50) and my previous offer ($125). This shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my target. 
* **Framing it positively:** I've highlighted the benefits for both of us.  ""Split the difference"" creates a sense of fairness.
* **Keeping the negotiation open:** I've ended with a question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to get a price as close as possible to my target while still remaining open to negotiation. If Bob rejects my offer again, I'll reassess my position and be prepared to either counteroffer again or switch to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $118.75 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $110, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** Bob's offer of $110 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and only slightly higher than his initial offer of $90.
* **Further negotiation unlikely to be fruitful:**  There's little room for negotiation left.  Even if I counter with a slightly higher price, it's unlikely Bob will budge further.
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John ensures I receive my minimum price of $150, guaranteeing a profit and avoiding any further negotiation headaches.

**Strategy:**

While I'd prefer to get a higher price, time is a factor and further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome. Selling to John provides a guaranteed profit and allows me to move on to other opportunities."
