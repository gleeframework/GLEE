"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save money.  While $12,000 is his maximum, it's in his best interest to try and negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer starts the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows his intent to negotiate and sets the stage for a back-and-forth process. $11,000 is a substantial discount but still within the range of what Bob is willing to pay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,500, which is only $500 more than Bob's initial counteroffer. This is a good deal for Bob, as it's $500 less than what he would pay John. Accepting the offer saves Bob money and allows him to complete the transaction."
