Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his level of interest and price sensitivity. If he immediately rejects it, you can always lower the price. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Remember, you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120. This knowledge empowers you to be firm in your negotiation with Bob."
