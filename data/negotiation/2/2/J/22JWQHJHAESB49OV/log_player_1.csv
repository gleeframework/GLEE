```

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. Would that be possible? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.

* It's better to keep negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."

```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.
