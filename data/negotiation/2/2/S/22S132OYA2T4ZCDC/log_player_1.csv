Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $15,000 is higher than your minimum of $10,000, giving you some room to negotiate.
* **It's not too high:** A very high starting price could scare Bob away.
* **It includes a positive message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential value of the product for Bob.

Remember, this is just the first offer. You'll need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's responses!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8000 at this time. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Bob.  You can still make a counteroffer that's closer to your desired price point, potentially leading to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. $8,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $12,000. It's still a great price for the value this product offers.  Let me know if you'd be open to this."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $8000. It's a fair price for both of us, and allows me to move forward with this purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is firm on his $8,000 offer, which is below your minimum acceptable price.  While you could continue to counteroffer, it's likely that the negotiation will go back and forth without reaching a mutually agreeable price.  It's best to cut your losses and sell the product to John for $10,000, ensuring you at least meet your minimum goal."
