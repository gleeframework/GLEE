Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum acceptable price of $80 and leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $80 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not satisfied with Bob's counteroffer. It's too close to my minimum and doesn't leave me any room for profit. I believe I can do better, so I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering $90 as a counteroffer. This is a compromise, as it's lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's counteroffer. It allows for further negotiation, but also shows I'm willing to meet him halfway. I believe this price is fair, considering my minimum value and the possibility of selling to John for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is a good compromise. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price and leaves some room for profit. While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial offer, I don't want to risk losing the sale and having to sell to John for only $80. Accepting this offer ensures a good deal and prevents any further negotiation."
