Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to someone like you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We know Bob values the product at $150. Offering it at $120 allows us to capture a significant portion of that value.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While we aim high, starting at $120 leaves some space for Bob to negotiate down, potentially settling somewhere between $120-$150.
* **Avoid Alienating Bob:**  An overly aggressive offer (close to $150) might discourage Bob completely.  We want to appear fair while still prioritizing our profit.
* **Secure a Profit Above John's Offer:** The $120 price ensures we make a profit even if Bob rejects the offer and we have to sell to John for $80."
