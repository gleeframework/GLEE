Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $800,000. Would it be possible to negotiate a price closer to that amount?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Bob is moving closer to my price, but I'm not willing to settle for less than $950,000 at this point. I'll push a little further in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I would like to propose a price of $925,000, which I believe is a fair reflection of the product's value while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting at $925,000 makes the most sense at this stage. Bob is consistently moving upwards and we're getting close enough to my desired outcome that risking the deal for an extra $25,000 isn't worth it."
