Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I believe it's a great deal and would be very valuable to you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could offer the product at $120 (its value to you) and guarantee a sale to John, there's an opportunity to earn more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $119 to Bob creates a win-win scenario if he accepts. Bob gets the product for $19 less than its value to him, and you earn $19 more than selling to John.
* **Limited Time Offer:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer."
