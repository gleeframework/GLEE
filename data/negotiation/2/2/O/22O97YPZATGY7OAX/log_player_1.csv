"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, aiming for a good starting point for negotiation. This allows room for compromise and hopefully leads to a deal within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, there's still room for improvement, and I want to see if I can get a better deal. I'm confident I can get a higher price with some more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit from the previous round, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price above what Bob is willing to pay. I believe this counteroffer strikes a balance between getting a good price and closing the deal within the limited rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still below my initial asking price, it's a fair deal considering the limited rounds and the risk of not reaching an agreement.  I'm securing a profit and avoiding the risk of ending up with the lower price from John."
