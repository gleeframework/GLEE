"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm Alice. I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $145. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($150) but above your minimum ($120). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a high profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This first offer will help gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate. His response will provide valuable information for future rounds. 
* **Alternative Option:** Keeping the John offer ($120) in mind provides a safety net. If negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably, Alice can always opt for the guaranteed sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a decent offer, Alice knows Bob values the product at $150. Rejecting this offer keeps the door open for a potentially higher counteroffer from Alice in the next round, aiming to close the deal closer to Bob's valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your perspective, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $138? This feels like a fair price for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 138
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Bob's offer ($130) and Alice's previous price ($145). It signals a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly higher than her minimum.
* **Justifying the Price:** By framing it as a ""fair price"" and meeting in the middle, Alice attempts to make the offer more appealing and less likely to be instantly rejected by Bob. 
* **Time Consideration:** With seven rounds remaining, Alice can afford to make incremental moves towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit higher on the price. How about we try $135? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:**  Bob has now stated this is his ""lowest"" price. While he might be bluffing, it's a strong indication that he's close to his limit.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Further negotiation might yield a slightly higher price (e.g., $136-137), but the potential gain is relatively small compared to the risk of losing the deal altogether.
* **Time Value:**  Accepting now secures a solid profit of $15 above Alice's minimum.  Dragging out the negotiation for a few extra dollars might not be worth the time and effort."
