"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer, but $12000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but I'd need to be closer to $14000. Let's keep talking!",14000.0,Alice,3,
