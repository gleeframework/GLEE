"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $900,000 is less than Alice's valuation of $1,000,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's significantly closer to his maximum budget. This is a good starting point for negotiation, as it shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but also won't overpay.  The $850,000 price leaves some room for further negotiation, but it's a strong first move."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is higher than Bob's initial offer, and still above his budget.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob is better off continuing to try to get a lower price rather than accepting Alice's offer or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing a willingness to compromise.  $875,000 is still within his budget, but it's closer to Alice's previous offer, potentially making her more likely to accept. This is a good strategy for making progress in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer keeps increasing, and it's now well above Bob's budget.  While there are still rounds left, it's becoming increasingly likely that Bob will not be able to reach a deal with Alice within his budget.  To avoid further risk and to secure the product, Bob should buy it from John for $800,000. This guarantees him the product at a price he can afford."
