,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $130 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's make this happen.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $135 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $137.50? It's a fair price for both of us and will allow us to close this deal.",137.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I think $137.5 is still slightly higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I'd like to propose a price of $132.5 for the product. I hope this helps us reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",132.5,Bob,6,
