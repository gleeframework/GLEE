Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,500. I believe it would be a valuable asset to you."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible without scaring him off. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants, potentially landing on a price that's still very beneficial to me.
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 with John gives me leverage. I'm willing to walk away from a lower offer from Bob. 

This strategy balances ambition with a realistic understanding of the negotiation dynamics."
