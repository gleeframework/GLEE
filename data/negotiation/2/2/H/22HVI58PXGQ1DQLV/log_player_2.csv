Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is within your budget and represents a significant improvement from her initial offer. While you could potentially try to negotiate further, there's a risk that she'll reject your counteroffer, and you might end up having to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a price that's favorable for you."
