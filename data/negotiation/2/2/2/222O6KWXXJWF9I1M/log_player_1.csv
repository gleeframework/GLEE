Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:** Bob is willing to pay $8,000, so $10,000 is a price he might consider.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're willing to accept no less than $12,000, so you're giving yourself room to negotiate.
* **It's a clear opening:**  The message is friendly and invites Bob to participate in the negotiation."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm going to try to get closer to that by counter-offering."

Bob's offer:

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell it for that price. I'll make one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
