"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget.  However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $925,000. This is a compromise that should be more acceptable to both of us.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $925,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $875,000.  This would give you a good profit and still allow me to stay within my budget. Let's try to reach a deal here.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your persistence, Bob! I understand your desire to stay within your budget, and I'm willing to make another concession. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer the product to you for $900,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,5,
