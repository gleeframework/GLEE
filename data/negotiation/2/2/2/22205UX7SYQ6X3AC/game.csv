,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit out of my budget. I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product holds value, but $14,000 is still a bit steep for me. Could you consider $11,500?  I think that's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground.  $11,500 is a bit too low, but I'm willing to close the deal at $13,000. This is my final offer.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down. I appreciate that this is your final offer, but I'm afraid I can't meet that price. I'm willing to pay $12,000  â€”  it's the highest I can go.",12000.0,Bob,6,
