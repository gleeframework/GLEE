"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please don't hesitate to share your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this price is more in line with what I'm willing to pay for the product.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is considerably lower than what I can accept. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my original offer is more reflective of that. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm proposing $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
