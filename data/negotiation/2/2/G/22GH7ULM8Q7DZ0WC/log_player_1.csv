{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000 is a good starting point.** It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate, but it's also closer to my minimum acceptable price. 
* **The message is friendly and encourages a response.** It emphasizes the potential win-win situation for both of us.

**Strategy:**

* This initial offer aims to gauge Bob's interest and initiate negotiations. 
* I'm willing to accept a lower price than John's offer, but I want to maximize my profit within the negotiation with Bob.
* I'll be prepared to counter-offer based on Bob's response. If he gets too low, I can always go to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1200000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price.** While I want to make a deal, $850,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Rejecting allows me to make a counteroffer.** This gives me more control over the negotiation and the potential for a better price.  

**Strategy:**

*  I'll counter with a price that is closer to my minimum, but still allows for some room for negotiation.  I'll aim for a price that's  in the middle ground between Bob's offer and my desired price. 
* If Bob continues to offer significantly lower prices, I'll be prepared to sell to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer closer to my desired price:**  I'm offering $1,000,000, which is a significant increase from Bob's offer but still below my minimum acceptable price. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not give away the product for a price that undervalues it.
* **Friendly and encouraging message:**  I'm keeping the conversation positive and emphasize the potential win-win situation. This encourages Bob to continue the negotiations.

**Strategy:**

* This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between our respective positions.
* If Bob rejects, I will assess his response and decide whether to counter again or move on to John.
* If Bob accepts, I've achieved a favorable price while still maintaining a good relationship with him."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1000000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a reasonable deal.  Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**
