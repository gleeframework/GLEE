"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product of exceptional value. Given its unique features and potential, I'm confident it will significantly benefit you. I'm offering it for $1,300,000. I believe this price accurately reflects its worth and future returns."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We begin with an ambitious offer significantly higher than both our minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's eagerness. 
* **Justification:** We provide a confident message emphasizing the product's value, aiming to influence Bob's perception. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This first offer sets a strong anchor for the negotiation, hopefully leading to a final price closer to our desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below our minimum and John's guaranteed offer. We have room to negotiate and try to bridge the gap. We'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle while keeping John's offer in mind as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the value of this product is significantly higher than your estimation. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price reflects the true potential and returns you'll gain from this unique product."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We significantly decrease our initial asking price to show flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. However, we keep the offer significantly above Bob's, demonstrating we're not desperate to close at his initial offer.
* **Value Emphasis:** We continue to emphasize the product's value and potential returns, aiming to shift Bob's perception towards the higher end of his budget.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** We are conscious of John's standing offer but believe we can still reach a more favorable agreement with Bob before resorting to that option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you believe the product has significant value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly moving towards our desired price range, but we're not there yet.  His offer of $950,000 is still below John's guaranteed $1,000,000. We have room to negotiate, especially with six rounds remaining. We'll aim to push him a bit further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise.  To demonstrate my commitment to closing this deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This offer reflects a significant concession on my part while acknowledging the product's true value."",
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Movement:** We make another significant concession, moving closer to Bob's offer while still staying above John's guaranteed price.
* **Deadline Awareness:**  With five rounds remaining, we need to start applying gentle pressure. We emphasize our desire to close the deal and frame our price as a compromise. 
* **Value Reinforcement:** We continue to reiterate the product's value, hoping to nudge Bob towards the higher end of his potential budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced the product is worth $1,075,000. I'm willing to offer $925,000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is not moving sufficiently towards an acceptable price. He's decreased his offer, indicating potential unwillingness to meet our valuation. With four rounds remaining, the risk of getting stuck in a stalemate and losing both offers is increasing. John's offer provides a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is a reasonable outcome compared to the current trajectory with Bob. It's time to secure a favorable deal."
