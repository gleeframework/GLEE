"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. If you're not interested, I'll be selling it to John for $10,000, so this is your chance to get a better price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer

Alice is bluffing. She won't sell the product to John for less than what it's worth to her ($10,000). By rejecting her offer, you can likely get a better price from her in a future round or buy from John for $12,000."
