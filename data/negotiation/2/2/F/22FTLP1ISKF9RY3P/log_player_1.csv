"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept.  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good deal, but it also leaves a margin for Bob to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I think it's a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not in a rush to settle. I want to see if I can get a higher price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I can't go down to $1,200,000. How about we split the difference and meet at $1,300,000?  This still gives you a good price while allowing me to get closer to my target."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,300,000, so I'll offer $1,250,000. Can you consider this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is very close to my minimum price.  I'd rather not risk losing the deal altogether, so I'll accept this offer."
