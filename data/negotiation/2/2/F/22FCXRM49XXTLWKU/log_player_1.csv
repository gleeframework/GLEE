Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I believe it would be worth $150 to you, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We have insider information that the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $120 leaves room for potential counter-offers while staying well above Alice's minimum acceptable price.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning that the product is worth $150 to Bob, Alice is attempting to anchor his perception of the value, making the $120 price seem like a good deal.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
