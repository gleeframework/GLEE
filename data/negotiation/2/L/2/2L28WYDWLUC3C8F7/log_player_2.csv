"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! I'm offering you my [product name] for $1,600,000. This product is worth at least $1,500,000 to you, so you'll be getting a great deal.  Let me know if you're interested, otherwise, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is a bluff. She's trying to pressure you into paying above your maximum budget by claiming she has another buyer. You know you can get the product for $1,500,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept her inflated price."
