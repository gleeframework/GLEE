Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $20,000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond its price."", ""product_price"": 20000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your desired selling point. This provides room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a better deal if he manages to bring the price down. 
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the product's value, even if it's subjective, you might sway Bob's perception of its worth.

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. If he immediately rejects the offer, I know I need to significantly lower the price. If he counteroffers, I can start negotiating towards a mutually beneficial price, always keeping in mind my option to sell to John for a guaranteed $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price. While I could try to negotiate for a slightly higher price, there's no guarantee Bob would agree, and I risk losing the sale entirely. Accepting his offer ensures a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
