Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000 and she has a guaranteed sale at that price to John. Starting high allows room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Sense of urgency and exclusivity:** Phrasing the offer as ""exclusive"" and mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even if John is the only other one) creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly.
* **Justification of price:** While not explicitly stating the product's value, Alice hints at its ""unique value and potential,"" subtly justifying the high asking price. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's negotiating style:**  This offer assumes Bob might be willing to pay a premium. If Alice knows Bob is a tough negotiator or highly price-sensitive, a lower initial offer might be more strategic.
* **Risk tolerance:** There's a risk Bob might be turned off by the high price and walk away. Alice needs to weigh this risk against the potential for a significantly higher profit."
