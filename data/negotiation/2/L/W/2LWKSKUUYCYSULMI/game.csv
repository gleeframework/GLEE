"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I appreciate you recognizing the inherent value of this product. While $950,000 is a significant offer, I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial proposal.  Would you consider $1,050,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,025,000. I think this is a fair compromise that takes into account the product's value while also being mindful of my budget.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a price that works for both of us. While your offer is tempting, I'm still seeking something closer to my initial ask. Would you be willing to consider $1,037,500? This represents a small concession on my part while acknowledging the progress we've made in our negotiations.",1037500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1,015,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also being reasonable for me. I hope we can come to an agreement at this point.",1015000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I respect your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I need to be firm on the value of this product.  My final offer is $1,026,250.  This is a significant price reduction on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know your decision.",1026250.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand that you're firm on the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one last offer of $1,005,000. I think this is a fair price that takes into account the product's value, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price.",1005000.0,Bob,8,
