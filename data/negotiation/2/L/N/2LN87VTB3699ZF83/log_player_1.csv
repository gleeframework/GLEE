Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000** is a starting point that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but also leaves room for negotiation and allows for a potential profit for me.
* **The message** is friendly and invites Bob to engage in the negotiation, but also sets the tone that this is a fair price. 

By offering a price higher than Bob's perceived value, I'm encouraging him to engage in the negotiation and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum value of $1,500,000. I am prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the consideration. However, I believe we can come to an even better agreement. How about I offer to purchase your product for $950,000? This would allow us to meet somewhere in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price than Bob's initial value of $800,000, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a higher price. This will give me more leverage in the negotiation and potentially get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm offering a price of $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, but it's still well above Bob's initial counteroffer.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's counteroffer while emphasizing that my offer is still a fair deal. I'm also suggesting that we can find common ground.

This approach aims to keep the negotiation moving while maintaining a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position and am willing to consider your latest offer. However, I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000. This would allow us to approach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,050,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a higher price to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still below my minimum. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1,075,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm confident this is a win-win situation for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $1,075,000. This is a slight reduction from my previous offer, showing flexibility, but still above Bob's latest counteroffer.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing that the price is still fair while subtly putting pressure on Bob to consider my offer.

My goal is to find a price that is closer to my minimum while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I've reviewed your proposal and am willing to consider it. However, I would like to counter with a price of $1,060,000. This would allow us to move closer to a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,060,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still a significant distance from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I've been negotiating with Bob for several rounds and it's clear that he's unlikely to budge much further.  I've already conceded a good amount, and I don't want to risk accepting a price that is far below my minimum value. 

It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,500,000. While I would have preferred to close a deal with Bob, I need to prioritize securing a price that aligns with my financial goals."
