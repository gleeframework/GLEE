Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,150,000. This is a price that is:

* **Higher than my minimum acceptable price:**  I'm guaranteed at least $1,000,000 from John if Bob rejects the offer.
* **Lower than the value to Bob:** This gives Bob a potential profit of $50,000, making the offer attractive.

By offering a price closer to the middle ground, I'm increasing my chances of Bob accepting the offer while still maximizing my potential profit."
