"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $750,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not ready to accept it. I'm willing to make a slightly more aggressive counteroffer to $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
