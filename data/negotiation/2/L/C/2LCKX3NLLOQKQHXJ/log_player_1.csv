Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's higher than Bob's valuation:** This gives him an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** You're still leaving room to make a profit.
* **The message is friendly and encouraging:** This helps create a positive atmosphere for negotiation.

I'll continue to adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses and your instructions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. It's below my minimum valuation of $15,000. I will try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,500 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to accept $13,250 for the product. This gives us both a fair deal and allows us to move forward with the sale. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13250}
``` 

I'm offering a compromise price that's closer to my desired value while still being within a reasonable range for Bob. I'm hoping this will encourage him to accept and close the deal."
