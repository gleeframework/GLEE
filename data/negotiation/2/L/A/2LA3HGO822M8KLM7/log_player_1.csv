Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a significant discount from what it's worth to me, but I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high but fair:**  $12,000 is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting value to Bob:**  Mentioning the value to Bob establishes a foundation for a mutually beneficial deal.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This initial offer allows for Bob to counteroffer, potentially leading to a price closer to $12,000. 

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, you've successfully sold the product for a good price.
* If Bob rejects, analyze his counteroffer and determine if you're willing to accept it or make a new counteroffer. 
* Always keep the $15,000 offer from John in mind as your fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product at $12,000, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible for you to lower the price even further? I'm willing to consider offers up to $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $10,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting would be a huge loss for me.
* **Negotiation potential:**  Bob has shown interest and is willing to negotiate. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range.
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me leverage in the negotiation. 

**Next step:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to $12,000,  trying to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I understand you're working within a budget,  $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm comfortable accepting.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This would still be a great deal for you and allows me to stay within a reasonable range. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  $11,000 is a compromise between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($10,000).
* **Reiterating value:**  I'm still emphasizing the value of the product to Bob to encourage him to agree.
* **Maintaining a firm stance:** I'm not willing to go lower than $11,000, but this counteroffer shows I'm open to negotiation. 

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've successfully negotiated a fair price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide if I can go lower or if I should accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer of $11,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still seeking to keep my spending below $10,000 if possible. Could you consider bringing the price down to $9,500? This would be a significant improvement over the original offer and closer to what I'm able to spend. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,500 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Further negotiation would likely lead to even lower offers, which is not beneficial to me.
* **John's offer is secure:**  I have a guaranteed offer from John for $15,000, which is a significantly better deal than what Bob is currently offering.
* **Time is valuable:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing John as a buyer and potentially lowering my final price.

**Next step:**

I will sell the product to John for $15,000, ensuring a profitable and efficient outcome."
