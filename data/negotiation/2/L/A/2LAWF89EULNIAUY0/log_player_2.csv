You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is good, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows Bob to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  Offering $1,000,000 is a bold move, but it signals Bob's serious interest in the product while testing Alice's willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is a good compromise.  It's significantly lower than her initial offer and closer to Bob's counteroffer.  Accepting this offer saves Bob a substantial amount compared to buying from John.  Continuing to negotiate risks running out of rounds and being forced to buy from John at a higher price."
