Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'll really like it! I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You're looking to pay no more than $80, and her offer is significantly higher. You can try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but unfortunately, $130 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $105? It's a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to your desired price, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  You can try to negotiate a lower price.  You can also consider buying from John at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still more than I can afford right now. I'm really hoping we can find a middle ground. How about $90? This would be a good deal for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $90 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $100. This is a fair compromise, and it would be a good deal for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You should buy the product from John. Alice is still asking for more than you're willing to pay, and you only have 5 rounds left. It's better to go with the guaranteed price from John rather than risk going over your budget with Alice."
