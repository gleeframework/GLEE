"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but unfortunately, $130 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it, what do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $105? It's a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still more than I can afford right now. I'm really hoping we can find a middle ground. How about $90? This would be a good deal for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $90 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $100. This is a fair compromise, and it would be a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,
