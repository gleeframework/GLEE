"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a little high for me right now.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than my initial asking price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price point that's closer to $850,000. This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. Could we meet in the middle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $775,000 is still a bit above your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another adjustment to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm thinking of a price point that's closer to $825,000. This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",825000.0,Alice,5,
