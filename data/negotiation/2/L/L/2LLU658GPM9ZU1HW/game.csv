"Thank you for considering my product, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. While I understand your budget constraints, I must maintain a fair valuation for my product. I am unable to accept the $900,000 offer. However, I am willing to negotiate further. How about we aim for a middle ground at $950,000? This still allows for a reasonable profit while being more accessible to your current financial situation.",950000.0,Alice,3,
