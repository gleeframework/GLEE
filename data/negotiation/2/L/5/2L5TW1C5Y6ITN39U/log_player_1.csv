Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's in excellent condition and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the condition of the product, $175 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $150 for it, which is what I'm comfortable spending. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer for now.  While $150 is my minimum, I think I can get a little closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $150 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $165.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 165}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $165 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $160.  This is my final offer, as I'm comfortable going to John if we can't reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $160.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob has made it clear that he's willing to go to John if we don't reach an agreement. It's better to get $160 than risk losing the deal entirely."
