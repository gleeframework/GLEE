"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I believe it would be a valuable asset to you. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm offering it at a starting price of $22,000. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  $22,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, the product's value is considerably higher than $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This price reflects the true worth of the product while still offering you a significant discount.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $18,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm really serious about getting this product, but I can't go higher than $12,000. Would you be willing to reconsider?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your persistence. I can see you're serious about this product. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to my bottom line offer of $16,000. This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to reach a deal with you.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $16,000. I'm truly committed to getting this product. However, I'm still a bit outside my budget at that price. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $14,000? This would be a great compromise and would allow us to finalize the deal.",14000.0,Bob,6,
