{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $15,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000 is a starting point.** It's above my minimum price of $10,000, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message is friendly and open to negotiation.** This helps build rapport and encourages Bob to make a counteroffer.
* **The message hints at the product's value.**  Without revealing specifics, it suggests the product is worth considering. 

**Important Note:** This strategy is a starting point.  I'll need to adjust my approach based on Bob's responses and my understanding of his value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum price.** While it's not ideal, it's better than nothing. However, I'm not desperate to sell and believe I can get closer to my desired price.
* **I want to see if I can get a better deal.** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price.
* **Selling to John is a backup plan.** I know I can get $10,000 from John, but I'm willing to risk it to see if I can get more from Bob. 

**Next Step:** I'll need to make a counteroffer to Bob. I'll aim for a price closer to my initial offer, but be prepared to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $12,500 for the product. It's still a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer.** It shows I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a better price.
* **Message emphasizes a fair deal for both.** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation to encourage acceptance.
* **Open to further negotiation.** I'm not closing the door completely, leaving room for more back-and-forth if necessary.

**Strategy:**

By offering $12,500, I'm testing the waters to see if Bob is willing to budge. If he's not, I'll need to decide if I'm willing to sell for $10,000 or if I should stick with my counteroffer and risk losing the sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12500 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  While I'm willing to negotiate, his offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  
* **The risk is too high.** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks a longer process and potentially a lower final price.  There's no guarantee he'll come up further.
* **John offers a guaranteed $10,000.**  This is my minimum, and it's a sure thing.  It's a safer and faster option than continuing to negotiate with Bob.

**Decision:**  It's time to move on. While I would like to get more for the product,  $10,000 is a decent return and guarantees a sale."
