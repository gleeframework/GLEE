Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product could significantly benefit you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it at a price below its true value."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 to John, selling to Bob at a higher price can net a greater profit.
* **Finding the Sweet Spot:** The price of $1,150,000 is strategically chosen:
    * It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), giving us negotiating room.
    * It leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a ""deal"" if he negotiates down slightly.
    * It's close enough to our minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) that we still secure a substantial profit.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. We're prepared to negotiate with Bob, but we have a strong alternative (John) if Bob rejects our offer."
