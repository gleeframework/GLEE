"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise between the value I place on the product and the price you're willing to accept.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get closer to $1,100,000 to make this work for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1,075,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
