Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but it also leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get closer to Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $950,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his last offer. It's still above my minimum acceptable price and leaves some room for further negotiation if needed."
