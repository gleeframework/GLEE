"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is significantly lower than my minimum desired price but still leaves some room for negotiation. It also presents the offer as mutually beneficial to entice Bob into considering it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. That's my final offer, let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as there is still potential for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  But $950,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $975,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and is a fair compromise.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but I need to be sure it's the best price I can get. Can you consider $960,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm not ready to accept Bob's offer yet. While $960,000 is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better deal with further negotiation. Selling to John is still an option, but I want to exhaust all possibilities with Bob before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While I'd love to get closer to your offer,  $960,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $970,000, which is a very fair compromise.  This is a valuable product, and I'm sure you'll find it worth the price.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 970000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $970,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $965,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $965,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $965,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached my limit for negotiation with Bob. While $965,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not satisfactory. I've only got two rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing out on a better price.  Therefore, I'll sell to John for $1,500,000, ensuring I achieve my minimum desired price."
