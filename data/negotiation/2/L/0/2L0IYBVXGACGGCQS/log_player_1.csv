Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a strong offer that leans in your favor. This leaves room for negotiation while still conveying the product's value. 
* **Above Your Minimum:** The offer of $1,600,000 is significantly above your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000), giving you a cushion to potentially negotiate down.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer will help you gauge Bob's level of interest and flexibility in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. Considering my budget and the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your asking price and your minimum acceptable price.  While his counteroffer was expected, accepting $1,000,000 would be a substantial loss compared to selling to John.  It's time to counter and see if you can negotiate a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and market worth.  I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,400,000?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** You are acknowledging Bob's counteroffer and willingness to negotiate, which helps maintain a positive tone.
* **Significant Movement:** By dropping $200,000, you demonstrate significant movement toward Bob's price range, encouraging him to do the same. 
* **Justification:**  You're reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price, reminding Bob why your offer is reasonable.
* **Middle Ground:**  Suggesting $1,400,000 positions the negotiation at a price point closer to your desired outcome while still leaving room for further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but given my financial constraints, I must respectfully decline the $1,400,000 offer. I am willing to pay up to $1,100,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's latest offer of $1,100,000 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While he's showing some willingness to move, his increases are incremental.  It's unlikely you'll reach a price that satisfies both of you without significant concessions on your part. You have a guaranteed offer from John for your minimum price, making it the most logical choice at this point to avoid further negotiation and potential loss."
