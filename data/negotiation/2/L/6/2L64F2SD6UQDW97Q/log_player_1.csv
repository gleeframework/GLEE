Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great deal for you considering its value to you is $12,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $10,000 is a good starting point. It leaves room for negotiation while still being above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Highlighting Value:** Emphasizing the product's worth to Bob ($12,000) helps him see the potential benefit of the deal. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message invites Bob to respond and potentially counteroffer, keeping the negotiation process open. 

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects my offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer myself. I'll consider:

* **His Counteroffer:** How close is it to my desired price?
* **Time:** How much time do I want to spend negotiating?
* **John's Offer:** If Bob's counteroffer isn't acceptable, I'll always have John's offer as a backup."
