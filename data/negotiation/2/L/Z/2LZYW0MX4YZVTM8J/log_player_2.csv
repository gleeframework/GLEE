# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $92. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92

While $92 is still cheaper than John's price, we can likely still get a better deal by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for $92, but I'm still only comfortable paying $87.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value you're placing on the product and my budget. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 87}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still a bit higher on the price. How about we meet at $89? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $89 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than what John would charge, and it's closer to Bob's target price.  While a bit higher than Bob's last counteroffer, continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether."
