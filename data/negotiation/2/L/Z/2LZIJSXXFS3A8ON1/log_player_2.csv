"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product. This is a great deal, considering the market value is significantly higher. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
