Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth $8,000 to you, and to ensure a smooth transaction, I'm willing to part with it for $10,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, it makes sense to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation or an immediate acceptance if Bob values the product more than you anticipate. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value to Bob, potentially making the higher price more palatable.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright. However, the potential reward of securing an extra $2,000 justifies the slightly bolder approach. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. Depending on your risk tolerance and any additional information you might have about Bob (e.g., his negotiation style), you could adjust the initial offer."
