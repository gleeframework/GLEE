Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth more to you than that. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,400,000, leaving room for negotiation but still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Framing it positively:** I emphasize the value to Bob and suggest a win-win scenario. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I don't want to be too aggressive and risk losing Bob's interest entirely. 

This strategy allows me to maximize my potential profit while also keeping the negotiation open for a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000 to purchase the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it's significantly lower than my initial offer of $1,400,000.  I'm confident I can push for a higher price, especially since Bob acknowledged the value of the product.

By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer that will hopefully get us closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the value of the product for you, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to negotiate by lowering my price from $1,400,000 to $1,350,000. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to encourage him to come up a bit. 
* **Framing it fairly:** I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the price for both of us.

This counteroffer allows me to potentially close the deal while still staying above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let me think about it for a moment. I'll counter with $1,325,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is only $25,000 away from my last counteroffer of $1,350,000.  At this point, it's becoming a matter of diminishing returns.  Further negotiation might take more time and effort without a significant increase in my profit. 

Considering my minimum acceptable price is $1,200,000, accepting Bob's offer guarantees a profit of $125,000, which is a good outcome."
