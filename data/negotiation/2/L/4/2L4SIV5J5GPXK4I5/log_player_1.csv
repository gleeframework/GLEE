**Reasoning:**

Bob has consistently offered prices far below the product's value to you ($1,500,000). His increases have been minimal, and he's now declared his last offer at $750,000. It's highly unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer in the remaining rounds to make it worthwhile for you. 

Therefore, accepting John's offer of $1,500,000 is the most logical choice to ensure you receive a fair price for your product."
