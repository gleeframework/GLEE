"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, your initial offer is significantly above my budget. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your initial offer, the value of this product far exceeds $600,000. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price better reflects the true worth and potential returns you'll gain from it.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the reply. I appreciate you working with me, but that price is still too high for my budget. I can offer $700,000. I need to be mindful of my spending, but I believe this is a fair offer that reflects my strong interest in the product.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see your interest is genuine, but the price you're suggesting simply doesn't reflect the inherent value of this product. I'm willing to make a significant move to  $1,600,000. This is my final offer. I believe it's a fair compromise that acknowledges the value you'll receive.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but that price is still significantly outside my budget. I understand this is a valuable product, but I need to be realistic about my spending. I can offer $750,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,6,
