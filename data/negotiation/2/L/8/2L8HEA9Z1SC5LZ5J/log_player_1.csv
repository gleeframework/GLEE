Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives room for negotiation and leaves a potential profit margin. 
* **Positive Tone:** Using a positive and friendly tone in the message can help create a good rapport with Bob, increasing the chance of a successful negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending the message with an open question to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $125? That's still a good price for you, and I'd be happy to take it off your hands. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  Bob's offer of $125 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting would result in a loss.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While I could sell to John for $150, there's still room for negotiation with Bob. He's shown interest, and I might be able to get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer. 

I'll counter Bob's offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $125 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $150? This is still a great deal for you, considering the value it offers.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:**  My counteroffer of $150 meets my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Compromise & Appealing to Value:** I'm proposing a compromise by splitting the difference between our offers. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Positive and Encouraging:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere."
