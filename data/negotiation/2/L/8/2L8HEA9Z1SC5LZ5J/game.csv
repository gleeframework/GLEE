"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $125? That's still a good price for you, and I'd be happy to take it off your hands.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $125 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $150? This is still a great deal for you, considering the value it offers.  Let me know what you think!",150.0,Alice,3,
