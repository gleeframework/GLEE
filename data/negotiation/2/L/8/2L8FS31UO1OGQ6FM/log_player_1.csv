{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $20,000 is a bold move but sets a high starting point for negotiation. It leaves room for compromise while still giving you a decent profit margin.
* **Emphasis on Value:** Highlighting the product's ""unique value"" to Bob might pique his interest and encourage him to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Discussion:** The message ends with an open invitation for discussion, making it clear that you are willing to negotiate.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** If Bob accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* **John's Offer:**  I'll keep John's offer of $15,000 in mind as a safety net, but I'll aim to get a better price from Bob if possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $20000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm really interested in this product, but I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting it would be a substantial loss.
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  While Bob's initial offer was low, his message indicates genuine interest in the product.  There's potential to negotiate a price closer to my desired range. 
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me a safety net and allows me to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter Offer to Bob:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $15,000. I'll need to consider how much I'm willing to compromise based on Bob's interest and my desire to avoid selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest!  I appreciate you being upfront with your offer.  While $10,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $17,000 to make this deal work.  It's still a great value considering the unique benefits of this product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but Not Too Much:**  $17,000 is a compromise from my initial offer of $20,000, but it still provides a reasonable profit margin and is above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's unique value to reinforce its worth and justify the higher price.
* **Show Flexibility:**  My message shows that I'm willing to negotiate while maintaining a firm stance on my minimum price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll need to carefully assess Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll have to decide whether to make another counteroffer or sell to John.
* **John's Offer:**  I'll continue to keep John's offer in mind as a backup option, but I'm hopeful that I can secure a better price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $17000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13500?  I'm really eager to buy this product, and I believe this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Still Too Low:** $13,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While Bob seems genuinely interested, his offers haven't been high enough.
* **Risk of Further Negotiations:**  Continued negotiations with Bob risk a stalemate or further lowering of the price, potentially resulting in an even worse deal.
* **John's Offer is a Safe Bet:**  John's offer of $15,000 guarantees me my minimum profit and avoids the potential for a drawn-out negotiation with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Selling to John:**  I will proceed with selling the product to John for $15,000, as it's the most secure and profitable option at this point."
