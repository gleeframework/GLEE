{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
This product is worth $80 to me, and Alice is asking $120. It's a bad deal. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I really like the product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $85?  Let's see if we can find a price we're both happy with."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high.  I'm willing to pay $85, but I don't want to go higher than that.  I'll reject her offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $110 is still outside my budget. I'm happy to pay $90 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $105. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think this is the lowest I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $105 is getting closer to my target price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $90, and I'm confident Alice will eventually come down. I'll reject her offer and see if she'll budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $95 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're getting close to your target price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $100, but that's as low as I can go. This is the best deal I can offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unwilling to go lower than $100, which is still more than my target price of $80. I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it seems like Alice is not willing to budge further.  It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $80."
