Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a significant discount for Bob, but still allows me to earn more than my minimum acceptable price of $120 if he accepts. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm lowering my price to $100. This is a compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate, but still ensures a profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120, but it's getting closer. I'm willing to accept this offer because:

1.  It's a significant improvement over his previous offer.
2.  Further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or a lower price.
3.  Selling to John for $120 would be better, but it comes with the risk of Bob changing his mind and accepting my counteroffer later. 

Accepting Bob's offer is a reasonable compromise that allows me to secure a sale and earn a profit."
