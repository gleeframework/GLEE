Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for it. Would you consider accepting this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I am still unable to meet you halfway at $9,000. I would like to stick to my original offer of $8,000. Is there any possibility for us to reach an agreement at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation: Bob is firmly rooted at $8,000.  Continuing to negotiate is unlikely to yield a better outcome. Since John offers the same amount, it makes sense to take the guaranteed sale with John."
