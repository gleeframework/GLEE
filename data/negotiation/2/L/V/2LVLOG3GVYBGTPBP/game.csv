"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this deal work. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? It's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll offer $1,025,000. Can you consider this compromise?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
