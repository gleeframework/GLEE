# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  This price is fair considering my budget and the potential benefits the product offers. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.
