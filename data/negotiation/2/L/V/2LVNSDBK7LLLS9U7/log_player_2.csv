**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my maximum budget. I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price."

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to my budget, but it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer before going with John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,100,000, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to come down to $1,120,000, which is the lowest I can go. I'm confident that this price is still a great value for you, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,120,000 is still more than I'm willing to pay. I've already made two counteroffers and it's clear Alice is not willing to go any lower. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John for $1,000,000 and save myself $120,000."
