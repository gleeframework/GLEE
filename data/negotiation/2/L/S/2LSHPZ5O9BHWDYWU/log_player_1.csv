Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you. I'm willing to let it go for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you insight into his level of interest and potential for negotiation. 
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, so there's limited risk in aiming higher with Bob."
