Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. It's a fantastic deal on a product I know you're interested in.  Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible, while still exceeding my minimum selling price ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,999 allows some room for Bob to potentially negotiate and still feel like he's getting a deal.  It also avoids anchoring the price too low.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects this offer, I can still sell it to John for my minimum price."
