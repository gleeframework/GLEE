"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective. While $15,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $13,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be frank, $12,500 is cutting it very close to my bottom line.  How about we settle at $13,000? I'm confident this would be a fair deal for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $12,750, which is my absolute maximum. Can you consider this offer?",12750.0,Bob,6,
