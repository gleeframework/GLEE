"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $800,000? That's still a great value for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,3,
