"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is $1200000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $900000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and the market demand.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $850000 is the right price. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. I believe this price is more in line with what I'm comfortable paying, considering the product's value and the market conditions.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $825000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Alice, but I still think $825000 is a bit high. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $725000 for the product. I believe this price is a fair reflection of its value and the market conditions.",725000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $725000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $795000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think?",795000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Alice, but I still think $795000 is a bit high. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $725000 for the product, but I'll throw in an additional $5000 for any additional services or support you can provide. This way, I'll get the product at a price I'm comfortable with, and you'll still get a good deal.",725000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to add value with the additional services and support. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $725000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $775000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand, and it includes the additional services and support you're looking for. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $775000. I'm willing to pay $700000 for the product, and I'll accept the additional services and support you're offering. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you don't accept it. I've already considered buying the product from John for $1200000, and I'm not willing to go above $700000.",700000.0,Bob,10,
