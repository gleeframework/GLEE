{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob. It also sets a positive tone by emphasizing the value of the product. This allows for some negotiation room while still aiming for a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but I am only able to offer $12,000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can squeeze a little more out of the negotiation. I'll reject his offer and counter with a slightly lower price, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to be flexible, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to go up to $12,250? This would allow both of us to get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 12250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $12,100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and it's likely we won't get any closer. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit."
