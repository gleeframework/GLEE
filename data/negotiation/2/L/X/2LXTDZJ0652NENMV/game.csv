"Bob, I'm offering you a rare opportunity to own a product of exceptional value. I'm asking for $1500000, but I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000, which is the maximum I can afford for this product. I believe it's a fair price given the value you've mentioned.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $800000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This price reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to feel satisfied. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1200000 is still a bit out of my reach. I'm willing to offer $900000. This is a significant jump from my previous offer and shows my commitment to finding a deal. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1050000. This is a fair price considering the potential of this product.  Let's make this deal happen.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product, but $1050000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the price you initially wanted.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us before we run out of time.",950000.0,Bob,6,
