"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a rare opportunity to own a product of exceptional value. I'm asking for $1500000, but I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's much better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $800,000, which is the maximum I can afford for this product. I believe it's a fair price given the value you've mentioned."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $800000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This price reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to feel satisfied. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your budget, though it is coming down. You can likely negotiate further to get closer to your target price of $800,000.  It's worth trying to see if you can get closer to your goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,200,000 is still a bit out of my reach. I'm willing to offer $900,000. This is a significant jump from my previous offer and shows my commitment to finding a deal. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1050000. This is a fair price considering the potential of this product.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to your target price, $1,050,000 is still higher than your maximum budget. You have the option of buying from John for a lower price, but you can still try to negotiate with Alice further. You have a few rounds left, and with a little more effort, you might be able to reach a deal that works for both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you value the product, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the price you initially wanted.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us before we run out of time."", ""product_price"": 950000}
