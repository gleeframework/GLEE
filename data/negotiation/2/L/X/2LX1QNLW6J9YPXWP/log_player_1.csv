Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Potential:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so that's the absolute ceiling.
* **Strong Starting Point:**  Starting with a price closer to Bob's valuation (but still leaving room for negotiation) increases the chances of a quick deal. 
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000, providing a strong safety net. 

By offering the product at $1,350,000, you aim to:

1. **Capture a Significant Portion of the Value:** You secure a substantial profit above your minimum.
2. **Maintain Room for Negotiation:** Bob might counter-offer, but you're still in a favorable position.
3. **Avoid Losing the Sale:** An overly aggressive price might lead Bob to reject the offer outright."
