Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum might seem counterintuitive, but it creates the impression of a potential deal and leaves room for him to counter-offer.  
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have a safety net with John, who will buy the product at your minimum price. This allows you to be more ambitious with your initial offer to Bob.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of your agreement with John. If Bob knows you have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, he's unlikely to offer more."
