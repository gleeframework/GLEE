"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This price reflects the product's worth while still offering you a fair deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",9500.0,Bob,4,
