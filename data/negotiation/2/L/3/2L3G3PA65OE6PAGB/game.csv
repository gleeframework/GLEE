"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $1,000,000.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,000,000 simply doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
