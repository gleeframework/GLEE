Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  This is a great deal for both of us - a significant savings for you, and a price I'm comfortable with. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $1,000,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While I appreciate his interest, $1,000,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to be closer to my asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,000,000 simply doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
