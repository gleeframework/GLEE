Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Value to Alice:** $1,200,000 
* **Value to John (fallback):** $1,200,000
* **Unknown Value to Bob:**  We don't know what Bob values the product at, so we need to take a risk. 

**Strategy:**

Offering $1,500,000 represents a significant profit for Alice over her minimum value. It's also a price that might be attractive to Bob if he values the product highly.  If Bob rejects, Alice can still sell to John for her minimum value, ensuring no loss. 

This strategy balances the desire for a higher profit with the risk of losing the sale to Bob."
