"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Given the value of this product to me, I'm prepared to pay $850,000.  I believe this is a fair price that allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $850,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you and the market demand. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still out of my range. I'm prepared to pay $900,000, which is a significant amount and reflects the value I see in this product.  Let's work together to find a compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to be flexible. I can offer it to you for $1,050,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This price takes into account the value you see in the product and my own needs. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer!  I'm still committed to buying this product, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a fair price for both of us. This offer demonstrates my genuine interest in working with you.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not ready to accept $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This price takes into account the value you see in the product and my own needs. I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,7,
