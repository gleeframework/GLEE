"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously crafted to provide exceptional value. I believe it could greatly benefit your needs. Let's discuss a fair price for this valuable item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a good price, it's still above my maximum budget. I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $95 is a bit higher than I'd hoped to spend. Would you be willing to go down to $85?  I'm really interested in this product and I think $85 would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. Considering the value and quality of our product, I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. How about $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my $85 counteroffer, but it's closer to my budget than her initial offer. I'll try another counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  $90 is still a little high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $87.50?  That way we can both be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Considering the value of the product and aiming for a win-win situation, how about we settle at $89? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $89 is very close to my last counteroffer of $87.50. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice rejecting my next counteroffer and increasing her price is high.  Furthermore, I only have 5 rounds left before I have to buy from John.  Therefore, it makes sense to accept this offer and secure the product for a price that's within my budget."
