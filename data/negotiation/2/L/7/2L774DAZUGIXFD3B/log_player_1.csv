Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters.  I'm hoping he sees the value in the product and is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I can always lower the price a bit in a counter-offer, but I'll keep John's offer of $8,000 in mind as my absolute minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob's offer is very close to my initial asking price and significantly higher than John's offer.  I'm happy to accept this offer."
