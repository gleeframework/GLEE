Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  I'm also aware that I have John as a backup buyer, so I don't need to settle for anything less than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still holding out for more. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000} 
```

I'm going to lower my price slightly to $1,900,000. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still confident in the value of my product.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's getting late in the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  $1,750,000 is a good price and better than what I'd get from John."
