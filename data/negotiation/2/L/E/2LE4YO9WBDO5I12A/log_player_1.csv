Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe its true value is closer to $20,000, but I'm willing to part with it for $17,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 17000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below your ""stated"" value of $20,000 creates the perception of a deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the price is high, it leaves space for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's interested, allowing you to potentially secure a price higher than $15,000. 

**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy. You could try different approaches depending on your risk tolerance and how badly you want to potentially close the deal with Bob quickly."
