"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know if that works for you.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $130 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $120? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it would allow us both to walk away satisfied.",120.0,Alice,5,
