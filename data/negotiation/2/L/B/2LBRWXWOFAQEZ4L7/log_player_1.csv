Round 2
Bob's offer:

While Bob's offer is below my minimum, it's not drastically low. I'll reject it and counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?  That's a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. Let's close this deal and make it happen."", ""product_price"": 15000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Bob's offer of $14,000 is getting closer to my minimum. It's better than selling to John for $15,000, and I'd rather close the deal with Bob if possible."
