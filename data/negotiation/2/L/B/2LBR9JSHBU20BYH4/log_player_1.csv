"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still within a reasonable range. This allows room for negotiation while also ensuring I don't immediately lose money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $175 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable value. I'll counteroffer and try to find a price point that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to see you're willing to negotiate.  $125 is still a bit high for me. How about $110? That's a good middle ground, and it's the most I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$110 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $150. I'll continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $110 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to drop to $115.  This is my final offer.  Let's close the deal and both be happy."", ""product_price"": 115}
