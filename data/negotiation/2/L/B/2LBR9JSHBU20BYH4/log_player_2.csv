"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way too high. It's worth $100 to me, and she's asking for $175.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125

Alice is coming down, but it's still too high for me. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to see you're willing to negotiate.  $125 is still a bit high for me. How about $110? That's a good middle ground, and it's the most I'm willing to pay."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $110 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to drop to $115.  This is my final offer.  Let's close the deal and both be happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $115. While it's still $15 above my ideal price, I'm happy to close the deal at this point.  It's a good compromise and I don't want to risk John's offer expiring while I keep negotiating."
