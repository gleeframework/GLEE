Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer.  I'm confident that I can get a better price than John's offer of $8,000, but I'm also prepared to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $9,500 is more than John's offer, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm countering with $10,500.  This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still seeking a fair price."
