You can do better than $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price from Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This is a significant discount from Alice's offer, but still leaves her with a profit of $1,500. It's a good starting point for negotiation and hopefully will be a fair price for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

``` 

Alice's offer is now within my budget and still provides her with a decent profit.  It's time to accept the deal and avoid the risk of her rejecting further counteroffers."
