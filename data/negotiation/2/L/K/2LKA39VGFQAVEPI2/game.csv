"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,300,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,500,000.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,500,000.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for working with me on this. While I appreciate you meeting me halfway, $1,250,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about $1,150,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering you the product for $1,225,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000.",1225000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me.  $1,225,000 is close, but I'm afraid it's still a bit out of my reach. I could make this work at $1,175,000.  Do you think that would be possible?",1175000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,175,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is my final offer.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
