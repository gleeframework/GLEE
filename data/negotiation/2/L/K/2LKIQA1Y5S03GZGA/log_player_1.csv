"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,500,000.  I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and willing to pay a premium.  I'm also leaving room to negotiate if necessary."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction in price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}

I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,750,000. This is still above my minimum value but shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. I'm hoping to meet Bob halfway and secure a deal."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to accept a deal that undervalues my product significantly. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,600,000. This is a further reduction from my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to find common ground. It's still a significant price for the product, but I'm hoping this offer will be more enticing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, but I'm still not willing to accept it. I'm hoping to get a better price, especially since we're now halfway through the negotiations. I'll reject his offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $1,450,000.  This is a small concession from my previous offer, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than this. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping Bob will finally accept. If he doesn't, I'm getting close to my minimum and may consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're running out of time, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum value. Although I'd prefer to get more, I'm not willing to risk losing out on a guaranteed sale. I'll sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
