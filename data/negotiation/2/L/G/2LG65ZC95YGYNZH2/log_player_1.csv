Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I'm confident it will be highly valuable for your business. My asking price is $1,400,000. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is below Bob's perceived value but still gives me a good profit margin.
* **Enthusiasm:**  My message is positive and emphasizes the product's value to build trust and encourage Bob to engage.
* **Flexibility:** I'm open to negotiation, but I'm starting with a strong price point to show I value the product.
* **Safety Net:** I have John as a backup, which gives me the freedom to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet my price expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's better than John's offer, it's still significantly below my minimum desired profit margin. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** Bob's message indicates he's willing to negotiate.  I can likely get a better deal by making a counteroffer. 
* **Risk Assessment:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, but I'm confident I can secure a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate.  While $1,200,000 is a bit below my expectations, I'm open to finding a compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? It's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a counteroffer that's midway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** I emphasize finding a ""fair price"" that benefits both parties to create a collaborative tone.
* **Maintain Value:**  $1,300,000 is still a good profit for me and keeps the negotiation focused on a price within my acceptable range. 
* **Clear Next Steps:**  I'm asking for a clear decision from Bob to move the negotiation forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1300000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $1250000.  This price is fair to both of us and allows for a smooth transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my Minimum:** $1,250,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** Continuing to negotiate could be time-consuming and may not yield a significantly better price.
* **Secure Sale:**  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of Bob walking away entirely or further lowering his offer.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While a higher price would be ideal, the potential gain from continuing to negotiate may not outweigh the potential loss from a failed deal."
