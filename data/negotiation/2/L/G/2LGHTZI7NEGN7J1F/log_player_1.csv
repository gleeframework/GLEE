Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I need, but knowing that Bob values it at $120, it gives us room to negotiate. I'm confident that we can find a mutually agreeable price within a reasonable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $140 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $150. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to meet Bob halfway on this one.  $145 is a fair compromise, and hopefully, he'll see it that way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer is getting too low for my comfort.  Since John is willing to pay $150, I'll take that offer and avoid any further negotiation risk."
