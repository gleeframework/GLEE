Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,350,000. This is a one-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to earn as much as possible. Since Bob values the product at $1,500,000, there's room to negotiate above my minimum price of $1,000,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,350,000 creates a win-win situation. Bob gets a $150,000 discount from his perceived value, and I gain a significant profit above my minimum.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By stating it's a one-time offer, I encourage Bob to act quickly and seriously consider the deal. 
* **John as Backup:** While I'm confident in this offer, I have a safety net. If Bob declines, I can still sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
