Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9,000? This offer stands until the end of the day, as I do have other interested buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down on her price, $9,000 is still a significant markup from John's offer of $8,000. It's unlikely Alice will go much lower given her mention of other buyers.  Sticking to your budget and buying from John is the most financially sound decision."
