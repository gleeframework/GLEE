"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I appreciate your offer, $6,000 is significantly below its value.  I could consider letting it go for $11,000.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but $11,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9,000? This offer stands until the end of the day, as I do have other interested buyers.",9000.0,Alice,5,
