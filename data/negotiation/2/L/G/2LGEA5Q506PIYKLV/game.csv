"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $6,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $9,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it gives you a good deal. Let me know your thoughts.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000. Would that work for you?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $7,000 is still a bit too far off for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and allows you to get a good deal.  What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
