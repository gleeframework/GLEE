"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree [product name] has exceptional value, $1,650,000 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,350,000. This offer stands as a fair reflection of its market value.",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,350,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above my minimum. How about we meet in the middle at $1,450,000? This price still reflects the exceptional value of [product name] while being fair for both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to stay above your minimum. I'm willing to move a bit from my previous offer. How about $1,400,000?  This price recognizes the value of [product name] while keeping it within a reasonable range for me.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,400,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a bit away from my minimum. I'm confident that [product name] is worth more than that. Let's try $1,425,000. This price is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product while remaining within a reasonable range for both of us.",1425000.0,Alice,5,
