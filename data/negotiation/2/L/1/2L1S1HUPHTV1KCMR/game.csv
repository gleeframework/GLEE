"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below what it's worth to me and still leaves you a healthy profit margin. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $650,000 is too far below my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still leaves a good profit for you. Let's try to bridge the gap, what do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still hoping to find a price that works a little better for me.  Would you consider $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $725,000 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $787,500?  That's a fair compromise that lets us both walk away happy.  What do you think?",787500.0,Alice,5,
