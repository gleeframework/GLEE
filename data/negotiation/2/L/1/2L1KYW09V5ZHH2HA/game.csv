"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a premium for a unique and valuable item, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway and sell it to me for $90?",90.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $90. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $105. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $95? I'm willing to pay a premium, but I really want to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price?",95.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll sell the product to you for $110. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,
