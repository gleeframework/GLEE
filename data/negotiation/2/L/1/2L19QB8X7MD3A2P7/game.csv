"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm looking for a quick sale. How about $20,000?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see a price closer to $9,000 to make this work.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $20,000 represents the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet halfway at $14,500?",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down, but $14,500 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, but that's my limit.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to get a fair price for this product. Let's split the difference again at $12,250.  This is my final offer.",12250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but that price is still too high. I'm willing to pay $11,000, but if we can't agree on that, I'll have to consider John's offer.",11000.0,Bob,6,
