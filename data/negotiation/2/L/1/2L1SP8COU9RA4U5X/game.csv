"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $85.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $85 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? Let me know what you think.",107.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $107.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $96.25. What do you say?",96.25,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate that. However, $96.25 is still a little low for me. How about $102.50? It's closer to my initial price, and it's still a fair compromise, don't you think?",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $102.50 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle again at $99.37? I believe this is a fair compromise considering we've both moved closer to each other's positions. What do you think?",99.37,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product too. How about $101.00?  It's closer to my last offer, and it's still a fair compromise, don't you think?  Let's try to close this deal!",101.0,Alice,7,
