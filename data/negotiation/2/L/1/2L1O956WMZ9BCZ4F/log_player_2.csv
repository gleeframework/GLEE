# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $14,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $13,000 is closer to his budget, it's still higher than his maximum of $10,000. He can try to negotiate a lower price or buy from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $12,800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Bob should buy from John. Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. While it's closer than before, it's not worth risking further negotiation. John offers a guaranteed price within Bob's budget."
