Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $12,000 represents a fair market value, I understand your budget constraints. I could be persuaded to let it go for $10,500."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's unlikely he'll reach $10,000. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum and avoids further negotiation."
