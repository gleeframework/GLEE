Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully leaves some profit for me.  It's important to be upfront and clear with Bob about my expectations."

Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum threshold of $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't sell the product for less than it's worth to me. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

I'm proposing a counteroffer of $825,000. This is still within my desired range and hopefully makes Bob feel like we're making progress.  I'm also emphasizing the mutual benefit of finding a solution that works for both of us."
