```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to his target.  $1,300,000 is a substantial discount from Alice's initial offer, leaving room for negotiation. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a better deal, while still leaving room for a compromise."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1320000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, showing Alice that he's willing to negotiate but still aiming for a good deal. $1,320,000 is a small increment from his previous offer, but it shows he's willing to compromise while still trying to save money.  This approach allows him to potentially reach a deal without jeopardizing his maximum budget."
