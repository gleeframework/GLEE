"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $80 to us, but I'm willing to start negotiations at $95. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a good starting point,  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the starting point, I'm looking to pay closer to $80.  I'm willing to go to $85.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible. He knows the product is worth more than $80 to Alice, so offering $85 is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer. This gives Alice room to negotiate while still allowing Bob to potentially get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose a middle ground. How about we aim for $90? This respects your budget while still reflecting the value of the product to us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save money. While $90 is closer to his desired price point, he can potentially still get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and see if Alice is willing to drop the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $85.  Would you be willing to come down to $88?  It's a fair compromise that keeps us both happy."", ""product_price"": 88} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a compromise. He's increased his offer slightly from $85 to $88, showing his willingness to negotiate. This allows for a potential deal while still keeping the price lower than Alice's last offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see your point, Bob. Let's try $89. This is a step towards your suggested price, while still keeping some value for us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $89, which is only $1 more than Bob's last offer. This is a good deal for Bob, considering his maximum budget is $120. Accepting the offer saves Bob $31 compared to buying from John. Further negotiation might save a few more dollars, but it's not worth risking losing the deal with Alice."
