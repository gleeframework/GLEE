"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product for a price that I'm sure you'll find reasonable, considering its worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my value for this product.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer of $900,000, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer $950,000. This is a fair price that allows you to profit while also ensuring I get a good deal.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $950,000. How about we meet at $1,050,000? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you and the profit I need to make.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
