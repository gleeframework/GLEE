Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a sale.  Here's why:

* **For Alice:** It's $150,000 more than selling to John, a significant increase.
* **For Bob:**  It's $50,000 less than the product is worth to him, a good deal for him.

This leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to haggle, but it's likely to be accepted as it offers a good value proposition for both parties."
