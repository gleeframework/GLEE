"Hi Alice, I appreciate your time and consideration. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $13,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $15,500. This would still be a great value for you, and it's a fair price for me.  Let's make this deal work!",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $13,000. How about we try $14,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",14250.0,Bob,4,
