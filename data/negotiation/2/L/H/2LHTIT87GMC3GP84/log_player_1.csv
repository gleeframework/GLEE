Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a good starting point. I'm offering a price that's a bit higher than Bob's value but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a chance to gauge Bob's interest.  

**Important Note:** This is just a starting strategy. The optimal approach will depend on how Bob reacts and how much time you have to negotiate before you need to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $80. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum price of $120. It's worth trying to negotiate further. I'll make a counteroffer and see if I can reach a price that's more acceptable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference and agree on $90? This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I would like to stick to my budget of $80. Is there any possibility for us to reach an agreement at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is insistent on his $80 price, and I'm unwilling to go that low. It's clear we're not going to reach a compromise. While I'd prefer to make a profit, it's better to sell to John for $120 than to risk getting stuck with a lower price or continue negotiating endlessly."
