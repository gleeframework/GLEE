Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 925000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate down while staying well above my minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value, which can influence Bob's perception.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Secure a quick sale at a high price:** Bob might accept immediately.
2. **Establish a strong negotiating position:**  If Bob counters, I have room to negotiate down while still aiming for a price significantly higher than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity,  $925,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product. This price is fair considering your value and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $850,000 is tempting as it's above my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Here's why:

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** I know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, giving me a significant advantage. 
* **John as a Backup:** I have a guaranteed offer from John at $800,000, providing a safety net.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to push for a price closer to $900,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm confident in the value this product brings, especially to someone like you. How about we meet in the middle at $890,000? This allows for a win-win scenario."", ""product_price"": 890000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer aims to find a compromise while still remaining significantly above my minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value specifically to Bob, reminding him of his perceived worth.
* **Win-Win Framing:** By presenting it as mutually beneficial, I'm aiming for a more agreeable negotiation process. 

This strategy keeps the pressure on Bob while demonstrating a willingness to negotiate fairly."
