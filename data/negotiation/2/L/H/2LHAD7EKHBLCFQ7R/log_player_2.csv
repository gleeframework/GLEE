"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a very reasonable price of $12,000.  I believe it will be highly valuable for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget of $8,000.  It's not worth accepting.  You should reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product but would need to come in significantly lower. How about $8,500? This is my best offer, and it's a fair price considering my budget."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,500 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further. You could try to meet in the middle or even propose a slightly lower price again."
