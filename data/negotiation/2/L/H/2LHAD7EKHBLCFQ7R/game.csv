"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product but would need to come in significantly lower. How about $8,500? This is my best offer, and it's a fair price considering my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,500 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this quality.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go to $9,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the highest I can go.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to go with another seller.",9500.0,Bob,4,
