"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's opening offer is only $1,000 less than John's price. There's room for negotiation to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $11,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but slowly. We're still closer to John's price than Alice's perceived value. Let's see if we can push a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $9,750?  That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 9750
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $9,750. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,250. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is negotiating in small increments now. We're getting close to the point where we might need to consider John's offer if Alice doesn't budge significantly in the next round or two."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm sensing we're both invested in reaching a deal here.  To show I'm serious, I'll come up to $10,000.  This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:** This counter-offer is firm by stating it's our final offer, but it's also fair. We're meeting Alice at her product's value to her.
* **Time pressure:**  We only have a few rounds left. By making a final offer, we're applying some time pressure. Alice has to decide if she'd rather risk losing the sale entirely. 
* **John's offer in mind:**  While $10,000 is our maximum, we need to be prepared to walk away if Alice rejects it. John's offer is still a viable alternative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $10,000, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more offer: $10,300. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  Alice has countered our ""final offer"" and made it clear she won't go lower than $10,300. We're at an impasse.
* **John's offer is better:** Spending $12,000 with John is more expensive, but only by $700 compared to Alice's stubborn stance.
* **Time value and certainty:**  Continuing to negotiate with Alice is unlikely to yield a better result.  Buying from John saves us time and guarantees we get the product."
