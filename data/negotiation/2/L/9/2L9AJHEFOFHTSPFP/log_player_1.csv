"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable value ($120), it's still worth exploring if there's room for negotiation. I want to see if I can push him closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $95?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, I still believe there's room for negotiation.  It's getting late in the game, but I don't want to settle for a price too far below my minimum.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get Bob to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $85 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $90, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $90 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $82.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's getting very close to the end of the negotiations, and Bob is clearly not willing to budge much further.  I've already made several concessions, and while $82.5 is closer to my minimum value than previous offers, I'm worried that if I reject this offer, we may not be able to reach an agreement before the 10 rounds are up.  

Selling to John for $120 ensures I get my minimum desired price and eliminates the risk of ending up with a lower sale price."
