"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is much higher than $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $850,000 is still a bit higher than what I had in mind. How about we settle at $750,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go below $800,000.
