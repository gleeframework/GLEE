"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within a certain budget. Can you meet me halfway?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit lower than I can go. How about $110? It's closer to your offer, and I'm confident you'll still find it a great deal.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $105. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this is a fair compromise.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I value your interest in the product. While $108 is closer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $110. Let's split the difference - $109. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the purchase.",109.0,Alice,5,
