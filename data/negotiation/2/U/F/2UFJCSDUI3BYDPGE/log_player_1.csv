{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}

This offer starts with a friendly message and a price that is slightly below Bob's perceived value but above my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate while still maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll reject his counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about we split the difference and go with $135?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $132.50. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is very close and only $2.50 below my minimum.  It's likely we'll continue to haggle back and forth, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better price.  I'd rather secure the sale now and avoid the risk of him walking away or me losing time negotiating."
