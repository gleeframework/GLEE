"Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $8,000 for the product. Alice's offer is exactly $8,000, which means you won't save any money by accepting her offer.  Since you can get the product for the same price from John, rejecting Alice's offer is the best option to keep your options open. You might be able to negotiate a lower price with John or find another seller who offers a better deal."
