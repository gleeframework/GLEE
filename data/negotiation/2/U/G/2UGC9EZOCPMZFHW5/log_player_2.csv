"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,400,000 is better than Alice's initial value, it's still above Bob's maximum. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a lower price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which is a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still above his maximum price point.  This shows he's serious about negotiating but also leaves room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price reflects the value of the product to you and allows me to make some progress towards my target. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,350,000 is closer to his maximum price point, there's still room for negotiation before he considers John's offer.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. How about we split the difference and go with $1,300,000? This price is fair to both of us and allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate, but this time he's moving closer to his maximum price point. He's proposing a compromise that suggests he's serious about buying the product but is still looking for a good deal. This counteroffer shows a willingness to move closer while still maintaining a strategic advantage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I value your persistence and appreciate the offer.  While $1,300,000 is closer to what I'm aiming for, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000, which is a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit from the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,325,000, which is just $25,000 above Bob's maximum price point.  While it would be ideal to get closer to $1,200,000,  the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a breakdown and having to buy from John at a higher price is not worth it.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a reasonable price and avoids the potential for a less favorable outcome."
