"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen!",100.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $100, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $92?",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but $92 is still a bit too low. How about we split the difference and settle on $96? That way we both get a good deal and can move forward.  Let me know what you think!",96.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I like the idea of splitting the difference, but I was thinking more along the lines of $94. That way, I can still save a bit of money and we can both be happy.",94.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort, but $94 is still just a bit too low for me.  To be honest, I'm starting to think selling to John might be a better option at this point. However, I'm willing to make one final compromise. How about $95?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to continue working with you.  Let me know what you think!",95.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a final compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $95. I'd be willing to meet you at $93. That's the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",93.0,Bob,8,
