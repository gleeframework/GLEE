"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has value, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident in the product's value. Considering your offer of $650,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $750,000. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $750,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $700,000. Would you consider $710,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",710000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire for a compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $710,000. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you at $725,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,
