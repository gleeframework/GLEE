"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting high, aiming for the best possible outcome. Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm going to see how he reacts to a price significantly higher than my minimum. This will give me valuable information about his potential willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $800,000 is my minimum, I'm not in a rush. Bob's initial counteroffer shows he's willing to pay a significant amount. I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000.  This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows I'm flexible but still aiming for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum of $800,000, so accepting it would be a loss.  While John offers $800,000, I'm still hopeful I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my minimum to see if I can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to counter with $850,000. This is a small step closer to Bob's offer but still higher than my minimum. I'm aiming for a compromise, hoping to close the deal in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now significantly lower than my minimum. While I could keep negotiating, there's a risk of further price drops and running out of rounds.  John is offering my minimum, so selling to him guarantees I won't lose money. It's time to take the safe option."
