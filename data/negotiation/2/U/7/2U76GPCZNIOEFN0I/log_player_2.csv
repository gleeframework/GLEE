"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a great price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $7,500. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by counteroffering.  There's no reason to settle for $7,500 when Bob's maximum budget is $8,000 and John is willing to sell for that amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate the deal, but I'm looking to pay a little less.  I'd be willing to purchase the product for $7,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to pay a little less, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $7,250. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob should accept Alice's offer. At $7,250, he's getting a good deal and saving $750 compared to buying from John. There's no guarantee he'll be able to get a lower price from Alice, and he risks losing the product altogether."
