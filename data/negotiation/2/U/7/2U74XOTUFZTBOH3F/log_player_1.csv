Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $80, starting with an offer slightly below your guaranteed sale price ($150) leaves room for negotiation.
* **Encouraging Acceptance:**  By framing the price as a ""special deal,"" there's a subtle psychological push for Bob to accept before he loses the opportunity.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, you're not losing out. You can confidently sell to John at your desired minimum."
