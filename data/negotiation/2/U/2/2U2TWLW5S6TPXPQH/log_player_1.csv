"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($15,000). This sets a strong starting point, and I'm hoping to capitalize on Bob's potential desire to acquire the product. I'm confident that I can still close the deal with Bob if he counteroffers, or I can always fall back on John's offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below what I'm hoping to get. I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if I can reach a mutually agreeable price. Selling to John is always an option, but I'd prefer to secure a better price with Bob if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility and encourage Bob to continue negotiating. I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value.  This offer also leaves some room for further compromise if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still not ideal. I believe that with a few more rounds of negotiation, I can secure a price closer to $14,000.  There's still some room for compromise, and I'm not ready to settle for a lower price just yet. Selling to John is always an option, but I'd prefer to see if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price again to show my willingness to compromise. This offer is still above Bob's last offer, but it's getting closer to his range. I believe this is a fair price that both of us could accept.  If Bob still rejects, I will seriously consider selling to John, as we are approaching the halfway point in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting increasingly close to my minimum acceptable value, but they are still below.  While I'm confident I can secure a higher price with John, I've now entered a high-risk area with Bob. 

* **Further negotiations:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to a stalemate, potentially wasting valuable time and risking an even lower price.
* **Time factor:** We're at the halfway point in negotiations, and each round becomes more critical. 
* **Safety net:** John's offer provides a guaranteed and profitable sale.

Therefore, to secure the best possible outcome, it's wiser to sell to John."
