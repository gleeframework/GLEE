Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know you'll find great value in it."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's potential to sell it for more than your minimum price ($12,000).
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering it at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still getting you a great price.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell to Bob at any cost.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while keeping the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
