"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at $1.5 million to you, and I'm confident it will be a game-changer for your business. My initial offer is $1,200,000. This is a significant discount and leaves room for further negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High Starting Point:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is a good starting point considering Bob's value for the product and my minimum price. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the potential value the product offers Bob, making it more appealing.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I'm leaving room for negotiation, signaling flexibility and encouraging Bob to counteroffer. 
* **Clear Offer:** The price is clearly stated, making it a straightforward and professional offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'd like to start closer to my target price.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This reflects the value it holds for me and gives us both room to work with.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** While it's closer to my minimum, I'm confident I can get a better price.  
* **I want to maintain leverage.**  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation going and allows me to potentially improve the deal.
* **Time is on my side.**  With 9 rounds left, I have time to explore options and see if Bob is willing to come up further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see we're both committed to making this happen.  However, $1,000,000 doesn't quite meet my needs.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,100,000.  This price allows for a fair return on my investment and keeps the door open for a mutually beneficial outcome. "", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm countering Bob's offer with a price that is closer to my desired price but still shows flexibility. 
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a reason for the counter-offer, highlighting the need for a fair return on my investment.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive tone keeps the negotiation amicable and increases the likelihood of a deal.
* **Mutual Benefit:** I'm reiterating the idea of a mutually beneficial outcome to keep Bob engaged."
