"Hi Alice,  $180 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $130 right now. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I was really hoping to get closer to the value I have in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $165? I'm willing to sell it to you for $165.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $165 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $140, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's try to make this deal work.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still not sure I can go as low as $140. How about we compromise at $155? I'm willing to sell it to you for $155.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really want to make this deal work, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $145. It's my final offer.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to look elsewhere.",145.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $145. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $155 and $145, which is $150. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150.",150.0,Alice,7,
