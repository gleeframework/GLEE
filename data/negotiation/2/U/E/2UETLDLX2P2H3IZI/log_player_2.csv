"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which I believe would significantly benefit and enhance your business operations. Given its value to you, I am offering it at an exclusive price of $950000. This offer is tailored to ensure you receive exceptional value while allowing us to maintain a fair and profitable transaction. I look forward to your consideration and hope we can collaborate on this exciting opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal here. The product is worth $1,200,000 to me, but Alice is offering it to me for $950,000. That's a $250,000 discount. However, I can get the product from John for the full $1,200,000. I'm not sure if I want to pay the full price when I could get it for less from Alice. But on the other hand, I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal from Alice either. I think I'll reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John.
