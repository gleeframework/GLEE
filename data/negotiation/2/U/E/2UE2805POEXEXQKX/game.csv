"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $250. This is a great deal, considering its value is no less than $150 to me.",250.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $250 is a bit outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $100 right now.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $250 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $180. It's a great compromise, considering its value to me is no less than $150. Let me know what you think!",180.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for coming down in price, but $180 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to go up to $150. This is a fair compromise, considering my budget and the value you've placed on the product. What do you say?",150.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, and I'm glad we're getting close. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $150 just yet. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $170. It's a small step down from my original offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think!",170.0,Alice,5,
