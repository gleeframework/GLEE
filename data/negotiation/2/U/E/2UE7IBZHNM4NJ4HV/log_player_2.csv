"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product, which I believe will bring you significant value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than her product's value to her, it's still more than you're willing to pay. You know you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can move forward with purchasing from John and save $200,000."
