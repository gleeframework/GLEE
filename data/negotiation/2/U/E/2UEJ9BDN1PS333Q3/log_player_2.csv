Round 2

{""message"": ""I'm really interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $12000 is definitely too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15000, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'm not willing to go up to $15,000. I'll try to meet Alice halfway between $12,000 and $15,000. Here's my counteroffer:

{""message"": ""I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go up to $15,000. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?"", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  $13500 is still a bit too low for me, considering the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $14250 as a final compromise.  This would give us both a good deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250.
