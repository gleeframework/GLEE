"I'm really interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $12000 is definitely too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $15000, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go up to $15000. How about we meet in the middle at $13500?",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position.  $13500 is still a bit too low for me, considering the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $14250 as a final compromise.  This would give us both a good deal.  What do you say?",14250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not sure I can go up to $14250. How about we try $11500? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",11500.0,Bob,6,
