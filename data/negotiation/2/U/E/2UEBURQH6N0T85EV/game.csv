"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer.  While I recognize the product's quality, $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time.  I'm willing to pay $125 for it, considering the value I place on it.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. We understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the product's unique features and high demand, we propose a price of $140. This still reflects the product's value while providing some flexibility for both parties. Please let us know if this is acceptable.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However,  $140 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $125.  It's a fair price considering the value I place on the product and allows for some profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",125.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thank you for your persistence and understanding. After careful consideration, we've decided to further adjust our pricing. We're now proposing a price of $135 for the product. We hope this offers a balance between reflecting its true value and accommodating your budget. Please let us know if this revised price works for you.",135.0,Alice,5,
