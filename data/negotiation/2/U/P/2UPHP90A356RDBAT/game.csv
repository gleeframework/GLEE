"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in it. However, I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my valuation. How about we set the product price at $950000?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, and I see we're both interested in making this work. However, $950000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's benefits and allows us both to gain something from this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
