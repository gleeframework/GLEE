"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  I think it could really benefit you. Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000.  What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  That's a fair price for both of us, considering its value to me. What do you say?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $15,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $12,000.  It's a fair price considering the value to me, and I'm confident we can both benefit from this deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $12,000 is attractive, I can't let go of this product for less than $13,500. It's a small compromise for a valuable asset. What do you say?",13500.0,Alice,5,
