"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  I think it could really benefit you. Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high. It's worth $10,000 to you, and she's asking for $18,000.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  That's a fair price for both of us, considering its value to me. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is still too high.  It's worth $10,000 to you, so there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer is the best strategy to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $15,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $12,000.  It's a fair price considering the value to me, and I'm confident we can both benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $12,000 is attractive, I can't let go of this product for less than $13,500. It's a small compromise for a valuable asset. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,500, which is closer to your value of $10,000. While you can continue negotiating, the risk of her rejecting your offer and then going back up in price is high. Accepting this offer is a good compromise and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
