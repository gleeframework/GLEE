Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. This maximizes your potential profit. 
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly reveal the product's worth to you, it emphasizes the ""value and potential,"" hinting at its significance. This justifies the high price tag.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to negotiate.  Even if he counters with a lower offer, there's a good chance you'll land a price significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Confident Tone:**  The confident tone implies the value of the product, potentially influencing Bob to accept the high price."
