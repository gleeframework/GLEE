"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be perfect for your needs and it's worth a lot more than my asking price. How about we start the conversation at $20,000?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $20,000 is way too high for me. This product would be useful, but not at that price. I could consider something closer to $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. This product offers unique advantages and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. Could you consider something closer to $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. To be honest, my budget for this is closer to $10,000. If you can work with that, I'm ready to make a deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
