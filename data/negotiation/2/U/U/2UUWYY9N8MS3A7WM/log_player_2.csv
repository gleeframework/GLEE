"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be perfect for your needs and it's worth a lot more than my asking price. How about we start the conversation at $20,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is way above your maximum budget. You should definitely reject and make a counteroffer significantly lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $20,000 is way too high for me. This product would be useful, but not at that price. I could consider something closer to $8,000."", 
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $8,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it establishes a strong starting point for negotiation. It also leaves ample room to gradually increase your offer if needed.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting low, you signal to Alice that you're serious about getting a good deal and willing to negotiate.  
* **Alternative Option:**  You always have John's offer of $10,000 in your back pocket. If Alice is completely unwilling to budge on price, you can walk away and take John's deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. This product offers unique advantages and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. Could you consider something closer to $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** $17,000 is still significantly above your $10,000 maximum budget. 
* **Slow Concession:**  Alice came down a little, but not nearly enough to be acceptable. This suggests the negotiation might be slow.
* **John's Offer:** You're getting close to the point where continued negotiation might not be worth the potential savings compared to John's offer of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. To be honest, my budget for this is closer to $10,000. If you can work with that, I'm ready to make a deal."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a Limit:** It's time to be more transparent with Alice about your budget. By mentioning the $10,000 figure, you set a firm upper limit and signal that you're serious.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Letting Alice know you are ""ready to make a deal"" adds a touch of urgency and implies that if she meets your price, you'll likely accept.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** By now, Alice probably realizes you have an alternative option. You don't need to explicitly mention John, but the implication is there that her offer needs to be competitive."
