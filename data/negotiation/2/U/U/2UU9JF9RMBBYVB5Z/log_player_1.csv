Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price later. 
* **Anchoring:** Offering $120 first sets a high anchor. While Bob knows it's worth $80 to him, the initial higher price might make a slightly lower counter-offer seem more appealing.
* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  There's a chance Bob might accept the $120 price, netting you a significant profit.  

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he rejects this initial price. You can gradually lower your asking price, but never go below your minimum of $80."
