You can do better than $115. Let's see if Alice is willing to negotiate."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $110? That's a fair price for a product you'll find valuable.

$110 is a good price for the product, and it's still cheaper than buying from John.  Let's accept Alice's offer."
