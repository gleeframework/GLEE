"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of immense value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident you'll see its worth. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming to me first. While I agree the product is valuable,  $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still reflects the value of this product. This is a fair offer, and I believe it's in your best interest to consider it carefully.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $900,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would $825,000 be agreeable?",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $825,000 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $862,500. This is my final offer. If you're serious about acquiring this product, I encourage you to accept. Otherwise, I will need to explore other options.",862500.0,Alice,5,
