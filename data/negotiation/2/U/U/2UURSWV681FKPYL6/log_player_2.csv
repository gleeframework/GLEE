"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

It's always beneficial to try to negotiate a better price. $5,000 is significantly less than your $15,000 limit, so there's room for a counteroffer. You have 9 more rounds to try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 3000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $3,000, which is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price. This is a strong opening move to show I'm serious about negotiating and willing to walk away if needed.  It also leaves room for negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $4,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still quite a bit more than my initial counteroffer.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, as I still have 7 rounds left and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 3500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $3,500. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating and that I'm willing to move closer to her offer. However, I'm still keeping the price lower than her last offer, demonstrating that I'm not simply accepting her price.  I have 6 more rounds, so I'm not in a hurry to settle yet."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price range, but I still believe there is room for a better deal. I have five more rounds to negotiate, so I will continue to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 3800}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $3,800, continuing to show Alice I'm willing to compromise while still pushing for a lower price. We're nearing the middle ground, and I believe this counteroffer will get Alice closer to accepting. I have four rounds left, which is enough time to make a deal if she's willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

With only three rounds left, it's becoming risky to continue negotiating. While I'd prefer a lower price, $4,500 is still significantly less than my $15,000 limit. Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product and avoid the risk of not finding a deal in the remaining rounds."
