(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's much better to reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You have the option to buy from John for a price within your budget, so you have leverage in this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still higher than my absolute maximum. This is a good starting point for negotiation.  It signals that I'm serious about buying, but I'm not willing to pay her full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget, but closer. It's worthwhile to continue negotiating as we are getting closer to a potential agreement. Rejecting this offer allows me to make another counteroffer and hopefully secure a price closer to my maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, showing I'm willing to pay more, but still keeping it within my budget.  This counteroffer is closer to my maximum budget, and hopefully, Alice will see it as a reasonable compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget. While we are making progress, further negotiation might lead to a price I can accept, but it's also possible we'll get stuck in a prolonged negotiation.  To avoid risking more time and potentially missing out on the product, it's more prudent to buy from John at my maximum budget.  This ensures I get the product and stay within my financial constraints."
