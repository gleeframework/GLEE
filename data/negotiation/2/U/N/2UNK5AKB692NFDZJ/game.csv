"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Can you consider meeting me halfway?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,500?  That's still a fair price for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit above my budget. Can we try $10,750? I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,750 is still not a price I can accept.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but $11,250 is my final offer. It's a fair price for a valuable product, and it allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you say?",11250.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to make a fair deal, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,900, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",10900.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your effort, but $10,900 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but $11,075 is my final offer.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's the last offer I'm willing to make.  Let me know if you're interested.",11075.0,Alice,7,
