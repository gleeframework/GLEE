"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $13,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging while highlighting the value of the product. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to quickly get a sense of Bob's willingness to negotiate. By starting high but still within a reasonable range, I can gauge his interest and potentially secure a higher price than if I started too low. If he rejects, I'll adjust my next offer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Can you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While it's tempting to take the offer and close the deal, I need to hold firm to secure a more profitable deal. 

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I'll use this opportunity to try and bridge the gap between our expectations, while still ensuring I get a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,500?  That's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering $11,500, which is the midpoint between my previous offer ($13,000) and Bob's offer ($10,000). 
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's desire for a good deal but emphasizing that my previous offer was fair. I'm also suggesting a compromise to show flexibility and encourage him to accept.

**Strategy:**

By proposing a middle ground, I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price. This approach could make Bob more receptive to my counteroffer. If he rejects again, I'll continue to adjust my offers based on his responses, always keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price and the potential alternative deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit above my budget. Can we try $10,750? I'm willing to meet you halfway again. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $10,750 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get.  I'm not yet ready to accept this offer and risk losing out on a potentially more profitable deal.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and continue to counteroffer in the next round. I'm confident that I can still bridge the gap between our expectations and secure a price closer to my target.  However, I'm also aware that time is running out, so I need to be strategic about my next offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,750 is still not a price I can accept.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but $11,250 is my final offer. It's a fair price for a valuable product, and it allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $11,250, which is a compromise between my previous offer ($11,500) and Bob's offer ($10,750).
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's persistence while firmly stating that my previous offer was fair. I'm presenting this as my final offer, creating a sense of urgency and potentially encouraging him to accept.

**Strategy:**

By offering a slightly lower price and emphasizing that it's my final offer, I'm aiming to push Bob towards acceptance.  I'm also strategically using language like ""fair price"" and ""walk away happy"" to appeal to his sense of reason and fairness. If he rejects this offer, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John, as we're running out of time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to make a fair deal, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,900, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not high enough for me. I'm not willing to settle for such a low price and risk losing out on a potentially more profitable deal with John.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and continue to negotiate in the next round. I'm confident that I can still secure a better price. However, I'm also aware that time is running out, so I'll need to be strategic with my counteroffer and consider the possibility of selling to John if I don't see a significant increase in Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort, but $10,900 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but $11,075 is my final offer.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's the last offer I'm willing to make.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11075}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $11,075, which is the midpoint between my previous offer ($11,250) and Bob's offer ($10,900). This demonstrates continued willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's effort and reiterating my willingness to compromise.  I'm also emphasizing that this is my final offer, creating urgency and potentially encouraging him to accept.

**Strategy:**

With only a few rounds left, I'm aiming for a final compromise. By meeting Bob halfway again, I'm showing flexibility while still aiming for a price that's closer to my target. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely sell to John to avoid losing out on the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to be fair, but $11,075 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,950, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,950. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,950
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time and Bob's offer of $10,950 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I've been willing to negotiate and compromise, it's clear that we're too far apart in our valuations.

**Strategy:**

It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed sale to John for $15,000.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing both deals and ending up with nothing."
