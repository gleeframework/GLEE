Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,500,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's worth to me. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
