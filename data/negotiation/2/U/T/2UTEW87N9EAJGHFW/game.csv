"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,500,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's worth to me. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the product's value is significantly higher than your proposed amount. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This offer represents a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,350,000 is still above what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I truly believe it's a fair price. Let's try to reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
