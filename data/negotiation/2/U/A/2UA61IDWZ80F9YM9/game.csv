"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'd be interested in buying if you could come down to $100. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $150? It's a fair price for such a valuable product.",150.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $150 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $125?  This would allow us both to get a fair deal.",125.0,Bob,4,
