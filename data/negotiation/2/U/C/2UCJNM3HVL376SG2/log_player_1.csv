"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, just below Bob's perceived value, to see if I can secure a good price quickly. I'm leaving room for negotiation, but I'm confident I can still make a decent profit."

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I have 8 rounds left and I'm confident I can get a better deal with Bob or sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm confident I can get a better deal, especially with so many rounds left. I'm also not yet desperate enough to sell to John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm confident I can get a better deal, especially with so many rounds left.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $12,500. This is a significant compromise on my part, but I'm hoping it will be enough to convince Bob to accept. I'm also aware that we're nearing the end of our rounds, so I'm trying to close the deal before I have to resort to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, the negotiation has stalled, and Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum acceptable price but not quite there. I'm starting to feel the pressure of time, and I'm worried that Bob won't budge further. While I would prefer to make more money, I don't want to risk losing the deal completely. Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $10,000. This ensures I secure a sale and avoid the possibility of no deal at all."
