"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you reaching out. However, $200 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $150 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is offering my absolute minimum acceptable price.  There's no room for negotiation to earn more. I'll take the guaranteed $150 from John."
