# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is lower than what you would pay John ($1,000,000).  While the product is worth more to Alice, that's not relevant to your decision. You are focused on getting the best price for yourself."
