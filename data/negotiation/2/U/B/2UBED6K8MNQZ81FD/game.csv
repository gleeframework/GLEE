"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's worth. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $12,500 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go for $11,250? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",11250.0,Bob,4,
