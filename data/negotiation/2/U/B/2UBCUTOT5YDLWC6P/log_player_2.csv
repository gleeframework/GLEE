"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to be selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $15,000 for it.  I believe this price reflects the true worth of the product, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is way above your budget. You know you can get the product for $10,000 from John, so it's worth negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While you know your maximum is $10,000, starting with a significantly lower offer ($9,000) leaves room for negotiation and potentially a better deal. 
* **Gauging Alice's Flexibility:** This counteroffer will give you an idea of how flexible Alice is willing to be on the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  While $9,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to find a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** Alice has come down, but $13,500 is still significantly more than your $10,000 limit and John's offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's a substantial gap between her offer and your previous counteroffer, suggesting there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Alternative Option:** You have the safety net of buying from John, which gives you leverage to push for a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, Alice. However, $13,500 is still a bit out of my price range. Would you be open to something closer to $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer to Your Limit:**  You're increasing your offer, but staying below your $12,000 maximum and leaving space for one final push if needed.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will show Alice how serious you are about buying, while still aiming for a price that saves you money compared to her previous offer.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** You still haven't revealed your absolute maximum, keeping some negotiating power in reserve."
