"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm offering it to you for $170. What do you think?",170.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $170 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it, which is the value I see in it. Let me know if that works for you.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Bob. However, the product is worth significantly more to me than $100. How about we meet in the middle at $145?",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $145 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $120.  This is a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
