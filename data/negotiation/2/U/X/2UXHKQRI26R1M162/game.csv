"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable asset. As we start the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only go up to $850,000.  This would still be a great deal for you, considering my maximum budget is $800,000 and I'm willing to pay a premium for this specific product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's worth to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm ready to finalize the deal for $900,000. This is a significant discount from your original offer and a fair compromise given my budget constraints. ",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $900,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you a price of $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's true value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
