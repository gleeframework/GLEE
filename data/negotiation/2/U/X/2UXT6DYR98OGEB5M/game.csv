"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discussed, I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1,150,000. This is a fair offer considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a little steep for my budget. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth, but also shows I'm willing to work with you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $1,050,000 is closer, but still a bit high for me.  How about we settle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'll offer you a revised price of $1,025,000. This is still a compromise, but I believe it reflects the product's value and my willingness to work with you. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
