"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discussed, I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1,150,000. This is a fair offer considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth, but also shows I'm willing to work with you. What do you think?

It's time to cut bait.  Alice is unlikely to go below $1,000,000 and you have a guaranteed offer from John at that price."
