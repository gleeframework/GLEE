"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is worth much more. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $950000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not sure how much more I'm willing to go up.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $850000 is a significant amount, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900000. This is a fair price, considering its value and the effort I've put into acquiring it. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $900000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $850000 again. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $880000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and my costs. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm open to a deal. What do you think?",880000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $880000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $860000, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",860000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've made a final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $860000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I'll sell the product to you for $870000. This is the best price I can offer, and I hope you'll consider it. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",870000.0,Alice,7,
