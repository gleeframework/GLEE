"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a price of $14,500. This is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value of $12,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get a better price than John's offer, but I want to see if Bob is serious about buying."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low. I'm not willing to sell for that price, especially since I know John is willing to pay $15,000. I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to come up."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm lowering my price to $13,500. This is still a good price for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this will encourage him to come up with a better offer."
