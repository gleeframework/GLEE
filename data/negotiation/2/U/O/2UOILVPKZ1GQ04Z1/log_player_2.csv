"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a significant opportunity to acquire something truly valuable. If you're interested, let me know. Otherwise, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to create a false sense of urgency and scarcity. She claims she'll sell it to another buyer for $1,000,000 if you don't accept her higher price. However, you know John will sell it to you for $1,000,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you call her bluff and can get the product at the lower price from John."
