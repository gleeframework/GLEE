Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,000,000 (your guaranteed offer from John).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $1,350,000 leaves a significant profit margin for you while still being an attractive deal for Bob. He saves $150,000 from his perceived value, making it likely he'll accept.

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring Bob finds the deal appealing enough to accept."
