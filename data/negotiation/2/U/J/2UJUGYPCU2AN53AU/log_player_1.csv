"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  It's a real game-changer and I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm starting at $1,750,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value it brings. Let's talk!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not sure I'm willing to pay $1,750,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  I have 8 rounds left to negotiate with Bob and can still get a better price or sell to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,600,000, reflecting the value of the product and our ongoing negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Can you consider $1,350,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. I have 6 rounds left to negotiate with Bob and can still get a better price or sell to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000.  I'll continue to counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, $1,350,000 still isn't quite there for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will provide significant value for you. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,550,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  We are down to the last four rounds, and the risk of not being able to get a better price from Bob is too high.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value and avoids further negotiation."
