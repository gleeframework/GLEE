"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm confident you'll find it a great addition to your collection. Would you like to make an offer to purchase it?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm very interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay up to $1200000 for it. Would you be willing to consider that price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1200000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to negotiate further. I'm thinking more in the range of $1800000 to $2000000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $1600000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1600000 is closer to my budget, I'm still unable to go that high.  I'm prepared to offer $1400000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1400000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm thinking of $1700000. It's a fair price that I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,5,
