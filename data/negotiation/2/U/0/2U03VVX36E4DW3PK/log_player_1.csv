"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, hoping to maximize profit.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** $11,500 is a good starting point, as it allows for a few rounds of negotiation before reaching a point where I might consider selling to John for $10,000.
* **Friendly tone:** A friendly tone encourages Bob to continue the negotiation and helps build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to counteroffer at $11,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation:** $11,000 is still a decent price, but I can likely get closer to my desired value. 
* **Room for improvement:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a higher price. 
* **Avoiding John:** Selling to John would be a safe option, but I'm still hopeful I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price. Would you consider $11,250?  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway between our previous offers, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Still profitable:**  $11,250 is still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Urgency:**  ""Let's meet in the middle and close this deal"" adds a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'd like to counteroffer at $11,100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:** $11,100 is only $400 below my initial target of $11,500.  
* **Time pressure:**  With only 6 rounds left, it's getting risky to continue negotiating. 
* **Avoiding John:**  While I could keep trying, selling to Bob for $11,100 is a more secure option than risking a lower offer from Bob or being forced to sell to John for $10,000."
