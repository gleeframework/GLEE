"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you. I've given it a lot of thought, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking to save as much money as possible. Since Alice's offer is $1,200,000, which is more than my budget of $800,000, I'll reject her offer and consider buying from John instead.
