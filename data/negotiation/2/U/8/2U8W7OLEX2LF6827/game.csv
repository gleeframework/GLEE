"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $100 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $100 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $95, but I'm still a bit over budget. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  It's a fair price for both of us.",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to go down to $93, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product. What do you think?",93.0,Alice,5,
