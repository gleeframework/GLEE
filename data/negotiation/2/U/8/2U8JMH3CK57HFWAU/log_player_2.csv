"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a better price than $12,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible while still getting a good deal. Offering $9,000 is a reasonable counteroffer, as it's lower than Alice's initial price but still higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while also pushing Bob towards his goal of a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is a better price than $12,000, Bob is still closer to his goal of $9,000. There's room for further negotiation with Alice, so it's worth rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his goal price of $9000, but he needs to find a compromise with Alice. This counteroffer of $9500 shows a willingness to meet Alice halfway, while still ensuring Bob saves a significant amount of money compared to buying from John. It's a reasonable offer that increases the likelihood of Alice accepting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is getting closer to Bob's ideal price of $9,000, but it's still significantly higher than her minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This suggests Alice is willing to negotiate further but is not likely to go lower. 

At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to accept the offer and buy the product for $11,000. This is still cheaper than buying from John for $12,000, and further negotiation may not result in a price significantly lower than $11,000."
