"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're starting the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  This represents a significant investment on my end, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and potential returns. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While I'm getting closer, $875,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $860,000 for the product. I'm sure this is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the purchase.",860000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. After reevaluating the product's value, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer the product to you for $870,000.
