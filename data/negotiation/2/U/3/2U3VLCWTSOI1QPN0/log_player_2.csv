"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for $1,250,000. It's a significant investment, but I believe the value it holds for you makes it a worthwhile proposition.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can buy the product from John for $1,000,000, which is within his budget and saves him $250,000."
