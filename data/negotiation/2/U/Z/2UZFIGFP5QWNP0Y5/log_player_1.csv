Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer, as it's too low for me.  While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my value of $1,500,000. I'm going to counter-offer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $1,500,000 is still a bit too rich for my blood. I'd be willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that?

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  $1,300,000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still a bit short of where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,400,000?  I think this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is below my minimum acceptable price, and we've already gone back and forth several times.  It's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price.  John is a guaranteed sale at my target price, so I'll go with him."
