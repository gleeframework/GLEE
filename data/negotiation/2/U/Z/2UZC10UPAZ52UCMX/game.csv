"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is closer to its true value. How about we meet halfway at $1,100,000? This feels fair for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,075,000?  I'm confident this price would be fair for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
