"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price.  There's no guarantee of success, but it's a smarter move than accepting the first offer or immediately going to John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is closer to its true value. How about we meet halfway at $1,100,000? This feels fair for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is willing to negotiate, and Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to counter with a lower price, potentially getting even closer to his target price. While John offers a fixed price, there's still a chance Bob can secure the product for less by continuing the negotiation with Alice."
