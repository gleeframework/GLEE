"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,050,000. This still leaves room for profit for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,050,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. That's the most I'm willing to pay for the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm still not quite there with your offer. While I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer. It's a fair price that allows us both to come out of this deal with a positive outcome. Let me know if you're interested.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not sure if $1,000,000 is the right price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,000,000. How about $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,6,
