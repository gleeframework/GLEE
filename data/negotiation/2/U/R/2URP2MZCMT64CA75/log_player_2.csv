Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, while I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate,  $1,075,000 is still too far below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to go a little lower, but I can't go any further than $1,125,000.  This price allows for a comfortable profit margin for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.
