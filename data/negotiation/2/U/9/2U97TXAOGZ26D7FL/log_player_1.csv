Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible, but still offer an attractive price to Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, while still keeping Alice well above her minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Alice knows she has John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, giving her leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
