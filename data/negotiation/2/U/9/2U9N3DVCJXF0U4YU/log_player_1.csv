"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high, at $20,000. This is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium. I'm hoping to get close to my minimum of $15,000, but I'm willing to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell immediately.  I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counter with $18,000. This is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer, but still leaving room for potential negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $16,000, which is only $1,000 below my initial asking price and significantly closer to my minimum. While I could try to push for more, I'm not sure if Bob is willing to go higher.  It's better to secure the deal at $16,000 than risk losing him completely and potentially having to settle for John's offer of $15,000."
