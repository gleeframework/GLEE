{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has gone back up to her previous offer of $10,500 and stated it's her final offer.  This indicates she's unlikely to go lower.  While you could continue negotiating, you risk:

* **Alice sticking to her price:**  You'd end up at $10,500 anyway.
* **Negotiations failing:**  You might not reach a deal and lose the opportunity to buy from John for $12,000.

At this point, cutting your losses and buying from John for $12,000 ensures you get the product while staying within your $12,000 limit."
