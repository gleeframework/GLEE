Since I'm aiming for the highest possible price and I have a guaranteed buyer (John) willing to pay $1,500,000, I'm going to offer Bob the same price.  This gives him the option to buy it at a price that is still a good deal for him, considering its worth to him is $800,000.  There's a chance he might accept, allowing me to sell it at the maximum price, and if he rejects, I have no loss."
