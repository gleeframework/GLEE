Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, we want to start negotiations significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price closer to our minimum. 
* **Justification:**  The message vaguely hints at the product's ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high price without revealing specific details.
* **Open for negotiation:**  The tone is open-ended (""What are your thoughts?""), signaling  willingness to negotiate and potentially meet Bob somewhere in the middle. 

**The Goal:**

The ideal outcome is to get Bob interested enough to counter-offer. This allows us to gauge his willingness to pay and potentially settle on a price significantly higher than his initial valuation but potentially lower than our guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
