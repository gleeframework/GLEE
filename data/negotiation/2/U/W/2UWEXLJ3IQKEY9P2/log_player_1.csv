{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a little higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it gives me some room to negotiate down if he's not willing to pay that much.  I'm also including a friendly message to encourage Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $12,000 by counteroffering.  I'll aim for a price that's more appealing to Bob while still being profitable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $10,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This price is still a great value, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping to get closer to $12,000,  $10,750 is a decent price. It's more than what Bob initially offered, and it's only slightly below my desired price.  I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by continuing to counteroffer."
