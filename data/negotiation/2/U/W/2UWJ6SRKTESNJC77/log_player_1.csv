Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,999. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe you'll find great value in it."", ""product_price"": 11999}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, there's a chance to earn almost $4,000 more if Bob accepts your offer.
* **High but Believable:** The price is high enough to net you a significant profit but still slightly under your guaranteed sale price. This might make Bob think it's a concession on your part and a potential bargain. 
* **Quick Sale Incentive:** By offering a ""take it or leave it"" price, you might encourage Bob to act quickly before he misses out, even if he doesn't attempt to negotiate. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might counter-offer, or you might have to sell to John for your guaranteed $12,000."
