"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe this price reflects its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High Opening Offer:** Starting with a high price sets the bar for negotiation and allows for potential concessions later. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the product's value to pique Bob's interest. 
* **Flexibility:**  Offering a price that's above your minimum allows for room to negotiate.

**Reasoning:**

By starting high, I aim to gauge Bob's interest and determine his potential budget. If he rejects the offer, I can then adjust my price based on his counteroffer, keeping in mind the fallback option of selling to John for $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I would like to propose a price of $950000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting the Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value. 
* **Reasoning:** There's room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can secure a higher price. I believe I can potentially get closer to my initial offer of $1,000,000.
* **Risk:**  There's a risk that Bob may walk away if I keep rejecting his offers, but I believe the potential reward of a higher price outweighs the risk.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to $1,000,000, hopefully finding a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $975,000 is the lowest I can go. This price still reflects the significant value this product offers.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** This counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still remaining close to my desired value.
* **Message:**  The message is concise and reiterates the value of the product to justify the price. It also emphasizes the desire to close the deal. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:** By meeting Bob halfway, I'm signaling my willingness to negotiate but also showing that I believe the product is worth more.
* **Potential Agreement:** This counteroffer may be appealing to Bob, as it's closer to his previous offer.  It creates the possibility of a quick agreement.
* **Risk:**  Bob might still reject my counteroffer, but with a higher price than his previous offer, it's a good strategy to see if he's willing to budge."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $960000. I hope this aligns better with what you're able to offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Accepting the Offer:** Bob's offer of $960,000 is very close to my desired price and is only slightly below my last counteroffer.  It's a good deal, and I don't want to risk him walking away and having to settle for John's offer. 
* **Reasoning:** 
    * Time is running out, and I'm getting closer to my desired price.
    *  I don't want to risk Bob becoming frustrated with the back and forth and ultimately choosing to walk away. 
* **Risk:**  While I could try to squeeze out a little more, the risk of losing the deal altogether is not worth it.

**Conclusion:**

Given the circumstances, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice. It ensures I get a good price for my product and avoids the risk of having to settle for a lower offer from John."
