I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000. Is this something you'd like to consider?,1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1200000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $900000. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise given the value of the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1050000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1000000.  Let's make this happen.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1000000, as that's the minimum price I'm willing to accept from you. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, but I need to be closer to my target. I'm offering the product to you for $1100000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price for the value the product brings.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
