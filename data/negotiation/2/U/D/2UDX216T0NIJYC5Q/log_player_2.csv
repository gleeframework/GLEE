Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested but $115 is a bit above my budget.  How about $105?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $109 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, but if we can't reach a mutually acceptable price, I might have to consider buying from John."
