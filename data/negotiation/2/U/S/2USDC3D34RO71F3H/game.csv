"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,200,000 is a respectable figure, the true value of this product, especially to someone with your goals, is significantly higher.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000.  This reflects my understanding of your needs while still recognizing the unique advantages this product offers.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
