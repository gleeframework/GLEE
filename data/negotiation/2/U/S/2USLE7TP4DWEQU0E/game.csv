"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to come down to $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still quite a bit below my minimum. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? I'm willing to be flexible to get this deal done.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. Let's try $9,000. This would be a fair compromise and I'm confident we can close the deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise. I'm happy to meet you halfway again, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle at $9,250? This would give us both a fair outcome and allow us to close the deal.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $9,250 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9,100. It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm hoping we can finalize this now.  ",9100.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle again. Let's go with $9,150. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",9150.0,Alice,7,
