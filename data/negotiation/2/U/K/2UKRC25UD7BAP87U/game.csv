"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $8,000. Would that work for you?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $18,000 reflects the product's true value, I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This offer is a compromise, considering its worth to both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down.  While I appreciate the offer, $14,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
