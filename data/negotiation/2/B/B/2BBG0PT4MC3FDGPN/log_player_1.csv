Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a price that is higher than his valuation of $80, but lower than my minimum desired price of $120. This gives Bob a chance to get the product at a discount, while still allowing me to make a decent profit. If Bob rejects the offer, I can sell the product to John for $120, so I'm not risking losing money by offering this price to Bob."
