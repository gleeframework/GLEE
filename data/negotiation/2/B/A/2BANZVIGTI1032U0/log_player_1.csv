Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Can we meet in the middle at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I reject Bob's offer because I am confident that I can get a better price for the product. I am also willing to risk continuing negotiations with Bob for a better price than selling to John for $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $70 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $85?  That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $85 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $75 for the product. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $75 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price, especially since I have several rounds left and can always sell to John for $80. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $82. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's a good compromise for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 82} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $82 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $78 for the product. Can we meet in the middle again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $78 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. We're only a few dollars apart, and I have several rounds left to negotiate. I'm willing to risk another round to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  Plus, selling to John would only give me $80, and I'm hoping for a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep trying to find a solution that works for both of us. How about $80? That's my absolute lowest I can go, but it's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. It's also a fair compromise, and I think we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 80}
