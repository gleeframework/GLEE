"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $13,500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $13,500 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $12,500 for the product. What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,750. What do you think?",13750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and I'll offer $13,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I think the product is worth more than that. I'll offer it to you for $13,200. It's a fair price, and I think we can both be happy with it.",13200.0,Alice,5,
