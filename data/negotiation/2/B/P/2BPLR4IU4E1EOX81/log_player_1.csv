Round 2

This is a good time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Meeting your goal:** While you'd ideally like more, Bob is now offering $15,000, which meets your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Negotiation progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating serious interest. Holding out for more might make him walk away.
* **Time constraint:** You're past the halfway point of the negotiation rounds. Continuing carries the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob and potentially losing the offer from John."
