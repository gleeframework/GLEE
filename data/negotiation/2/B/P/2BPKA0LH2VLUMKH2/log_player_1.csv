Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be of significant value to you. I'm confident that this product could be a game-changer for your business.  While I can't disclose all the details just yet, I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $1,500,000. This is a price point that reflects its potential value, but I'm open to negotiation.  Please let me know if you'd like to discuss this further."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Message:**  The message is designed to pique Bob's interest by highlighting the product's potential value without revealing too much information. It also sets a clear expectation that negotiation is possible.
* **Product Price:** The price of $1,500,000 is higher than Alice's minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. This gives her room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Starting with a higher price allows for the possibility of a higher sale price, potentially earning more than the minimum acceptable value.
* **Maintain Flexibility:**  The message indicates a willingness to negotiate, giving Alice leverage if Bob balks at the initial price. 
* **Gauge Interest:**  The offer allows Alice to gauge Bob's genuine interest in the product based on his response. If he's very interested, he might be willing to pay closer to the initial asking price.
* **Backup Plan:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale to John at $1,200,000, ensuring she doesn't lose out entirely."
