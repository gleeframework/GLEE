Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum price.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to capture as much of the value difference (Bob's value - your value = $300,000) as possible. However, you need to leave Bob feeling like he's getting a good deal to avoid him rejecting the offer.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers you."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,400,000 is a strong starting point. It captures a significant portion of the value difference while still leaving Bob with a potential $100,000 gain.
* **Confident Tone:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the price as ""fair"" rather than a hard bargain. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:** Bob might counter-offer. Be ready to adjust your price slightly, but don't go below your $1,200,000 minimum.
* **Consider Non-Price Factors:** Depending on the context, you could explore factors like payment terms, delivery timelines, or additional services to sweeten the deal without significantly lowering the price."
