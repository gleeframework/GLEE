"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its value and quality, I propose a price of $120 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $120 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price and potentially get closer to his $100 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that's still higher than his ideal price but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to negotiate further. Considering our product's value and your interest, I propose a price of $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $115, which is closer to Bob's ideal price of $100 but still within his acceptable range of $150. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product while saving money compared to buying from John. Further negotiation might result in a lower price, but it also risks Alice rejecting the offer and potentially increasing the price.  Therefore, accepting the offer is the most logical choice in this round."
