{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better price.  I'm going to reject and see if I can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm. While I'm interested, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

While Alice has come down a bit, I'm still aiming for a lower price. I'm going to reject her counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground closer to my initial counteroffer of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,050,000 is getting closer to where I want to be.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,025,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to move forward with the transaction."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

Alice has come down a bit again, but we're still a bit apart. I'm going to reject and see if I can push for a lower price. It's possible we might reach an agreement if I continue to counter, or I might need to consider buying from John if Alice doesn't budge."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand we're both trying to reach a point where we're both happy. While $1,075,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not quite there.  Let's try $1,050,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're trying to get close to the price you're comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I understand this is your final offer, I'm still hoping we can find a common ground. I'm willing to go up to $1,060,000.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I've already made significant concessions. I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer of $1,080,000. I'm starting to think it's time to explore other options. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm open to discussing the possibility of selling the product to another interested buyer.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is firm on her price, and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. While I'd prefer to pay less, it's not worth risking losing the product altogether.  Accepting her offer at $1,080,000 is still a good deal compared to buying from John for $1,200,000."
