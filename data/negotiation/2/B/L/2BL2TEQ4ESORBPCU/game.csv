"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm. While I'm interested, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. My counteroffer is $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,050,000 is getting closer to where I want to be.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,025,000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to move forward with the transaction.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. My counteroffer is $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and your willingness to negotiate.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand we're both trying to reach a point where we're both happy. While $1,075,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not quite there.  Let's try $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while still staying within my budget.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're trying to get close to the price you're comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. My final counteroffer is $1,080,000. I believe this is the best compromise we can reach at this point, and I'm willing to meet you here.",1080000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I understand this is your final offer, I'm still hoping we can find a common ground. I'm willing to go up to $1,060,000. This is a fair price that balances our needs and allows us to close this deal.  What do you say?",1060000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I've already made significant concessions. I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer of $1,080,000. I'm starting to think it's time to explore other options. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm open to discussing the possibility of selling the product to another interested buyer.",1080000.0,Alice,9,
