Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $850,000. Let's try to find a middle ground.

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he could try to negotiate further, Alice's offer of $825,000 is a good price and is closer to his target price than John's offer of $1,200,000. Continuing to negotiate risks Alice walking away from the deal entirely."
