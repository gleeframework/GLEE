"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000. This price reflects the value I place on the product, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further discussion.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $850,000. This price is still a great value considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm prepared to pay $800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and our shared desire to reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $850,000. Let's try to find a middle ground.",825000.0,Alice,5,
