"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $155 is still a bit outside my budget. I'd be happy to take the product for $140.",140.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $155 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I can offer you a compromise at $150. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",150.0,Alice,5,
