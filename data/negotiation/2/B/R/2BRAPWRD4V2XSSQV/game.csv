"I'm interested in the product, but I think $11,000 is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget of $10,000.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, though. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250? This would give us both a fair deal.  Let me know what you think.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $10,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I really need to stay within my budget of $10,000.",9800.0,Bob,4,
