"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the exclusivity you're providing. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a lower price of $820,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",820000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget considerations, but $820,000 is a significant deviation from my initial asking price. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects the true value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I still feel that the product's value doesn't justify the price. I would like to counter with an offer of $850,000. This price is based on my assessment of the product's value and my financial capacity.",850000.0,Bob,4,
