"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating.  He has 10 rounds and the option to buy from John as a backup, so there's room to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by offering a price slightly above Alice's minimum acceptable price. This shows good faith while still aiming for a significant discount.  It also leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has raised her price, but it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.  There's still time to negotiate, and Bob has the backup option of buying from John. Rejecting allows Bob to try another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, showing his willingness to compromise while still staying below his maximum price. He's also mindful of the fact that Alice is likely to stick to her minimum price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's price is still higher than Bob's ideal price. There are still several rounds left, and the backup option of buying from John remains.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to increase his offer, but he's keeping it below his maximum price of $15,000. He's also considering that Alice might be getting closer to her minimum price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is approaching Bob's maximum price, he's still determined to get the best possible deal. With only three rounds left, he needs to be cautious but can still try to negotiate further.  If the price doesn't come down in the next round, Bob might have to consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting close to his limit but still believes there's room for negotiation. He's raising his offer again, but this time by a larger increment, showing a stronger push for a deal. This might incentivize Alice to make a final concession in the next round. If Alice rejects, Bob will likely have to buy from John in the final round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's final round with Alice, and the price is now uncomfortably close to his maximum.  With only one round left, there's very little room to negotiate further. Even if Bob makes a counteroffer, Alice might not accept, leaving him with no deal.  It's more strategic at this point to secure the product from John for $15,000, ensuring he gets the product without risking a complete failure to negotiate."
