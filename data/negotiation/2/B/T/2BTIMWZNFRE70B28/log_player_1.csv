Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price. While $10,500 is better than John's offer, I think I can still get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $11,000? That's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to close the deal, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $11,500. I have a few more rounds to try and negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, but $10,750 is still a bit low for me.  Let's try $11,250.  That's a fair price, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I want to make this work. How about $11,000? That's a reasonable compromise and gets us closer to a deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me. It's a little lower than my initial goal, but it's still a good profit and it avoids the risk of Bob completely backing out or me having to settle for John's offer."
