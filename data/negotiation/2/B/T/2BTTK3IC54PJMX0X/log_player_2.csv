Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $14,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see you're still interested in the product, but $11,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair deal. I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a good middle ground for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $13,500.  To save the most money, it's better to buy from John at $12,000."
