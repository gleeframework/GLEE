Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  It's a fair price considering the benefits you'll receive from this product. Let's work towards an agreement that benefits both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $975,000.
