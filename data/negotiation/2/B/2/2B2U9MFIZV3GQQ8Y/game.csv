"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time. I believe this is a fair price considering the value to me and the opportunity for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What are your thoughts?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $975,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you and the original price I had in mind. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there at $975,000.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle and offer $900,000.  This is a significant compromise for me, and I'm hopeful we can reach a deal that benefits us both.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $900,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $925,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value of the product to you and the original price I had in mind.",925000.0,Alice,5,
