"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $600,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This price still allows for a good profit for you and is closer to my expectations. Let me know if that works for you.",800000.0,Alice,3,
