"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $9,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $9,000 is tempting, you know you have a backup option to buy the product from John for $10,000. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further to avoid losing the sale. By rejecting her initial offer, you might be able to negotiate a better deal."
