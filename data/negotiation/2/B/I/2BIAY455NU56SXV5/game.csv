"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know what you think.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $16,500 might be a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $16,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to you is $12,000 and its value to me is $15,000. Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Alice,5,
