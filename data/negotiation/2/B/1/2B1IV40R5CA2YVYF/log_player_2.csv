"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $14,000 isn't a terrible price, you can save money by rejecting Alice's offer. You're willing to pay $15,000, and Alice is willing to sell for less, meaning there's room for negotiation.  By rejecting her initial offer, you might prompt her to propose a lower price, closer to her own valuation of $12,000."
