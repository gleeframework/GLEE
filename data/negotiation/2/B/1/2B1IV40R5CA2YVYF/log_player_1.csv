Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring Alice gets a great deal.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Offering a price closer to $15,000 might make Bob feel like he's being taken advantage of and could lead to him rejecting the offer outright. 
* **Secure a Good Alternative:** Alice has a fallback option with John at $12,000, ensuring she won't be left empty-handed if Bob declines."
