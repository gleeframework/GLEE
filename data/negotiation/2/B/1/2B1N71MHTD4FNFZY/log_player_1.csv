We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob is clearly interested. Let's see if we can push a bit further."

Bob has shown he's not willing to go over $1,000,000.  While we could try to push him further, accepting his offer of $990,000 is a substantial profit and avoids the risk of him walking away."
