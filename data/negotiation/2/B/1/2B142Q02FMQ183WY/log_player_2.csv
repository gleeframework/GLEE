"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. It's worth at least $12,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $14,000 is less than your maximum budget of $15,000. While you could reject it hoping for a lower price, there's no guarantee Alice will go lower, and you risk having to buy from John at the higher price."
