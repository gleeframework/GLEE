Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $11,500 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is a good deal, I'm aiming for a higher price. I believe I can still push for a better price in the next round. I'll make a counteroffer closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a little too low for me. How about $11,000?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there at $11,000.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  Let's try to find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,750 is getting closer, I'm still holding out for a higher price. The product is worth more to Bob than that, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price range. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down to $10,900. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10900}
