"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $11,500 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a strong opening move that shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal.  The offer is still above Alice's value of $10,000, leaving room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a little too low for me. How about $11,000?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While $11,000 is better than $12,000, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there at $11,000.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  Let's try to find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, showing Alice that he's willing to negotiate but still wants a good price.  $10,750 is a halfway point between Bob's previous offer and Alice's current offer. This shows a willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down to $10,900. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a good deal for Bob. Alice has lowered her price to $10,900, which is within Bob's budget and only slightly higher than his last counteroffer.  Continuing to negotiate might get a lower price, but there's a risk that Alice might reject the offer and the deal could fall apart.  It's also possible that Alice's next counteroffer might be higher. Accepting the offer is the most logical choice, as Bob is likely to save a significant amount compared to buying from John."
