Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer sets a high price, but is still lower than the product's value to Bob.  It leaves room for negotiation and a potential counteroffer, while still securing a significantly profitable sale for Alice."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than the value to Bob. This gives Alice an opportunity to get closer to her ideal price.  She'll counteroffer to try to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This counteroffer moves closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating Alice's willingness to negotiate. It's still above the price Bob offered, but it shows a willingness to compromise and find a mutually beneficial solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to Alice's ideal price, it's still below her desired minimum. It's worth one more round of negotiation to see if a better deal can be reached before resorting to the fallback option of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This counteroffer meets Bob's latest offer, demonstrating Alice's willingness to reach an agreement. It's still a good price for Alice, considering her minimum is $800,000 and she can always sell to John. This offer is a good chance to finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below Alice's ideal price, and continuing to negotiate risks further lowering the price.  Selling to John guarantees a solid profit of $800,000, which is Alice's minimum.  Therefore, it's best to cut her losses and move on with the sale."
