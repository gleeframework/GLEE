Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $825,000? This is a good compromise, and it allows us both to get a fair deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $760,000 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $800,000. This is my final offer, and it's the lowest I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to her lowest price, which matches what John is offering. There's no point in risking further negotiation or potentially losing the deal."
