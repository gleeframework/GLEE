Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy behind crafting an offer to Bob:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob.  He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential profit margin between $800,000 and $1,200,000.

**The Offer**

You want to offer a price that's appealing to Bob (meaning it's less than $800,000) while maximizing your potential profit. Here's a possible approach:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product before I move forward with other buyers.  Given your interest, I'm willing to make this very attractive for you. How about a price of $750,000?"", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Why this approach?**

* **Strong Opening:** You acknowledge Bob's interest and present the offer as a limited-time opportunity, creating a sense of urgency.
* **Strategic Discount:** The $750,000 price gives Bob a significant discount, making it highly likely he'll accept. 
* **Maximized Profit:** You're still making a healthy $750,000, which is significantly more than your minimum.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is a dynamic process. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. If he does, you can decide whether to adjust your price slightly or politely decline and proceed with John."
