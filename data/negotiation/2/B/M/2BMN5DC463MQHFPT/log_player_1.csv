Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've valued at no less than $10,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that I think is fair and beneficial for both of us.  Would you be interested in purchasing it for $12,000?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:**  $12,000 is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation and a potential win-win scenario. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob. It also sets a positive tone for potential negotiations. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** This offer gives me a good profit ($2,000) while still being attractive to Bob.  
* **Negotiation Potential:**  If Bob rejects the initial offer, I can still negotiate further with him or move on to John, securing a sale either way."
