"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product exclusively to you before listing it publicly. I believe it's worth a great deal, but I'm willing to part with it for $150. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $120 from John, so there's no reason to pay $150."
