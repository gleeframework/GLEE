{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,350,000 is below Bob's maximum budget, it's still higher than John's offer.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if a lower price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get as close to John's offer as possible. A counteroffer of $1,250,000 is a significant step down from Alice's initial price, but still leaves some room for negotiation. This counteroffer shows Bob's serious intent to purchase while also highlighting his awareness of the market value."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now above Bob's maximum budget. With only three rounds remaining, it's unlikely that Alice will come down to a price Bob is willing to accept.  It's time to cut his losses and buy the product from John for $1,200,000. This ensures Bob gets the product while staying within his budget."
