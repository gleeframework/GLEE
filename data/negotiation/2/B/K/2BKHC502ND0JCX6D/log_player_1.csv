Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I'm confident it will exceed your expectations, and I'm open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start negotiations high. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you don't settle for less than your minimum.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""open to discussing this further"" signals to Bob that you're willing to negotiate, potentially leading to a faster deal. 

**Strategy:**

The goal is to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility on price. If he outright rejects the initial offer, you can significantly lower the price (closer to $1,750,000-$1,900,000 range) in a follow-up, making it seem like a significant concession. This approach maximizes your chances of getting the best possible price from either Bob or John."
