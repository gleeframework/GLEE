"Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $100. It's not even close to your perceived value of the product. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $100. This is the most aggressive counteroffer I can make while still being within my acceptable range.  I know Alice values the product at $150, so there's room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $160 is closer to my acceptable range, it's still above my perceived value of the product.  I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get a lower price. There's still room for Alice to come down further, and John's offer remains a safety net if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $120. This is a compromise, acknowledging Alice's need to make some profit while still staying within my acceptable range. I'm hoping Alice will see the value in making a deal at this price rather than risking losing the sale altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $155 is getting closer to my acceptable range, it's still higher than my perceived value of the product. Given Alice's unwillingness to budge significantly, and knowing John is offering the product for $100, it's more sensible to cut my losses and buy from John. There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice will lead to a better price, and I risk wasting more time and potentially getting stuck with a deal I'm not happy with."
