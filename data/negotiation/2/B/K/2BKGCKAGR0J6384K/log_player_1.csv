I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This gives me a good margin above my minimum value of $10,000 while still leaving room for negotiation. I believe this is a fair starting point, but I'm prepared to adjust my price based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than $10,000, I believe I can do better.  I'm going to counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm going to counteroffer with $14,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I believe it's a fair price, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is getting closer to my minimum value, but it's still not enough. I'm willing to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John rather than risk further negotiation with Bob."
