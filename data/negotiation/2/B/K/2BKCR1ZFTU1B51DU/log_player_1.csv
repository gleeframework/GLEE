{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's in excellent condition and I believe it will be a great asset for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $14,000 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  It's lower than the product's worth to Bob ($15,000), leaving room for a potential counteroffer.
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  It directly states your offer and encourages a response.

You can adjust the price up or down depending on your confidence in getting a better offer from Bob or your desire to close the deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you letting me know the product is in great shape. I'm really interested, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend.  How about $13,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
