"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can we meet in the middle somewhere? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can get closer to my desired price.  $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value, and I believe I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This reflects the product's value and provides a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit too rich for my budget. How about we meet at $950,000? I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, I believe $1,050,000 is a fair price considering the product's value. It's a significant investment, but it will offer you great returns. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,000,000. How about we try $975,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to this purchase, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where negotiations with Bob aren't progressing quickly enough to my satisfaction. While $975,000 is a higher offer than before, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to accept John's offer of $1,000,000 to ensure I get a fair price for the product."
