"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, as it's worth $8,000 to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $9,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum price, I still have 8 rounds left and I want to try and get closer to my desired price. I can counteroffer him and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a good deal for you given the product's value. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8,500, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $8,200 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,200 is only $200 below my minimum price.  It's a good deal, and I don't want to risk losing it by continuing to negotiate. There's a chance that Bob might not counter-offer further, and I could end up getting a lower price. Selling to John is also an option, but Bob's offer is closer to my desired price. Therefore, it's best to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
