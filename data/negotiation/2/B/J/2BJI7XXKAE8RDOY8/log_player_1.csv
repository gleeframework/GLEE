Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000.  Let's split the difference and see if we can agree on $11,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $11,000 is still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm happy to meet in the middle,  $11,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we try $11,250? This is a fair compromise that's closer to my budget.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $11,250 is closer to my desired price, I'm still willing to hold out for a little more. I believe there's still room for compromise, and I'm confident I can get closer to my goal with another counteroffer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,250 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference again and try $11,375. It's a small step closer to my target, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11375}
