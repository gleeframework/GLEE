"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000.  Let's split the difference and see if we can agree on $11,000.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm happy to meet in the middle,  $11,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we try $11,250? This is a fair compromise that's closer to my budget.",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,250 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference again and try $11,375. It's a small step closer to my target, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you say?",11375.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $11,375 is getting closer to what I can do.  I'm willing to go to $11,125, which is a small step from my last offer.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",11125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer to an agreement. I'm willing to come down to $11,250. This is a fair compromise and ensures we both get a good deal. Let's close this now.",11250.0,Alice,7,
