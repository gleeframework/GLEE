"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you starting the negotiation. However, $12,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be more comfortable with a price closer to $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $10,500. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However,  $10,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $9,000.  This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm now offering the product to you for $10,250. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your flexibility. While $10,250 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to land a bit lower.  Would you be willing to consider $9,500?  I think that's a fair offer, and it would allow me to make this purchase confidently.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm now offering the product to you for $10,000. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any lower.
