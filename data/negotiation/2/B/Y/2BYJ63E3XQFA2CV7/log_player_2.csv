# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly lower than John's offer of $15,000.  Even though Bob values the product at $15,000, accepting Alice's offer saves him $3,000."
