{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $90 is still slightly above your ideal price, but it's closer to your budget than John's offer of $100.

Accepting the offer ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids the risk of losing the opportunity altogether."
