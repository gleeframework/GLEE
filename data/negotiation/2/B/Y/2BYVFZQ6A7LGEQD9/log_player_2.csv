"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you're trying to save as much money as possible, it's always worth exploring other options before accepting the first offer, especially when it's at your maximum price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer of $120 is a reasonable first step. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial price, showing your intent to negotiate, but it's not so low that it seems unreasonable.  It allows for some room to compromise in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, but it's still not ideal.  Since there are still rounds left and you're aiming for the lowest price, rejecting and counteroffering again is the best strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate.  By offering $125, you are showing that you're serious about getting a better price while acknowledging her counteroffer. This is a small increase from your previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise without giving up too much ground."
