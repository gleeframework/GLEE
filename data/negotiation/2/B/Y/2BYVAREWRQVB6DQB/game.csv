"That's a bit steep for me, Alice. I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to  $600,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600,000 is a bit below my minimum, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $900,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, $700,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $700,000, which is $800,000. It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with.",800000.0,Alice,5,
