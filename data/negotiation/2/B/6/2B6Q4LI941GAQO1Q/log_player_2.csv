"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is within your budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice. This indicates there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Fair Price:** Offering $85 is still a profit for Alice ($5 above her value) and significantly lower than her initial offer, showing good faith.
* **Negotiation:** It positions you as a serious buyer willing to compromise.
* **Room to Move:** If Alice rejects, it leaves room for further negotiation while still staying within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $87.50, which is a great compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $87.50 is a significant improvement from her initial $90 offer. It's still within your budget and represents a good compromise.  While you could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice rejecting your next counteroffer and potentially leading to a higher final price or needing to buy from John makes accepting this offer the more sensible choice."
