Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's maximum valuation of $150 to maximize our profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring we get significantly more than John's offer. 
* **Confidence:** Offering a specific, slightly high price can make us appear more confident in the product's value. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting the best price from Bob and ensuring we don't lose the sale entirely."
