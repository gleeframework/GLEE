"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $105?  It's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $130 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $115. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I put into it.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $115 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $110?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $112.50. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",112.5,Alice,5,
