"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I think the price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $900000 is closer to our target, it's still a bit lower than what I believe the product is truly worth.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1050000. This would allow us both to walk away satisfied.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1050000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1025000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
