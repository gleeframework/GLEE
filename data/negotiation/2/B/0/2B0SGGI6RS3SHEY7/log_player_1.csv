Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This offer is a good balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a sale. Here's why:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** You're aiming for $1,000,000 minimum, so offering $1,400,000 is a substantial gain.
* **It's appealing to Bob:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, so paying $1,400,000 is a good deal for him, leaving him with $100,000 in value.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob counters with a lower price, you have room to negotiate, potentially closing the deal at a price closer to your ideal.

Remember, even though John is a backup buyer, aiming for the highest price possible with Bob is always the optimal strategy."
