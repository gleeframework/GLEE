Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $20,000 is significantly outside my budget. I'm willing to pay a maximum of $8,000 for it. This is my best offer, and I hope we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
