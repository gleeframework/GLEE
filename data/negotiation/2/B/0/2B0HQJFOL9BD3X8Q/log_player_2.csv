"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. My initial offer is $20,000, which I think is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth exploring counteroffers and seeing if you can negotiate a better price. There are still 9 rounds remaining to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $20,000 is significantly outside my budget. I'm willing to pay a maximum of $8,000 for it. This is my best offer, and I hope we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,000 is your maximum budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget of $8,000.  I'll continue to negotiate and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still too high for me.  I'm only able to go up to $9,000. This is a significant increase from my initial offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'll make a counteroffer of $13,500. This is a compromise between our previous offers, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I get a price that reflects the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still above my budget.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  I've reached a point where it's more advantageous to buy from John for $8,000. I don't want to risk wasting more time in negotiations and potentially getting stuck with a price I'm not comfortable with."
