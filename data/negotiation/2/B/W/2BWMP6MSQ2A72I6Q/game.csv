"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,250,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000? I believe it's a fair price that considers its value and allows me to make a worthwhile investment.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  While I'm eager to sell, $1,000,000 is significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle.  How about $1,100,000?  This price would allow both of us to achieve our goals. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $1,100,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a bit lower.  Would you be willing to consider $1,050,000? I'm confident that this price would be a win-win for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to go a little lower.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we settle at $1,100,000?  This would allow me to get a good return while ensuring you get a fair price.  It's a win-win scenario.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
