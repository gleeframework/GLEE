Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to go a little lower.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we settle at $1,100,000?  This would allow me to get a good return while ensuring you get a fair price.  It's a win-win scenario.

Alice is sticking to her guns at $1,100,000.  It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and continuing to negotiate might make her less willing to compromise. Accepting this offer secures a $100,000 saving compared to buying from John."
