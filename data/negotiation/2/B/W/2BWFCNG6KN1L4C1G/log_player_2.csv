Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I think we're really close now. I can see that you're willing to meet me at $12,500, but I'm not sure if I want to sell it to you at that price. I'm going to make one final offer: $13,000, and if you can't meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. This is my last offer, Bob. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing hardball and is unlikely to go below $13,000. While you could try one last counteroffer, there's a significant risk she'll refuse and you'll end up with John's $15,000 offer anyway. Cutting your losses and buying from John guarantees you get the product at a price you've already deemed acceptable."
