,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $9,000 is considerably below its value. I'd be willing to consider $13,000.  This feels like a fair compromise to me.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. Would you be open to considering that?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here, but $10,500 is pushing my limits. I can do $12,000, but that's my absolute best price. I do believe this is a fair offer given the value you're receiving.",12000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",11000.0,Bob,6,
