"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but my budget is around $1,250,000.  Would you be willing to meet me there?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1,275,000, which is a fair price considering the value this product brings to you. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,250,000 though. Would you be willing to do $1,260,000 as a final offer? It's a fair price for both of us.",1260000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $1,260,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer you $1,290,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings to you.",1290000.0,Alice,5,
