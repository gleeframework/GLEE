"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it would be beneficial for both of us if you were to consider acquiring this product. We're offering it to you at a special introductory price of $1350000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $1,350,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. After reviewing your offer, we've decided to counter with a price of $1250000. We believe this is a fair compromise considering the value the product offers. Please let us know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget. However, it's closer to his target price and indicates Alice is willing to negotiate. By rejecting and making a counteroffer, Bob can continue to try and push for a lower price without risking the deal completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still just outside my budget. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. How about $1,225,000? I believe this offer is fair given the value of the product and my financial constraints."", ""product_price"": 1225000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, thank you for your continued interest in our product. We understand your position and are willing to further accommodate your needs. Our counteroffer is $1240000. We hope this proposal will meet your expectations while ensuring a fair return for us. Please let us know if this offer is acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,240,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,240,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,240,000 is still slightly above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While they're getting closer, continuing to negotiate might risk the deal entirely. It's now in Bob's best interest to accept the sure thing and buy the product from John for his target price. This ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids further negotiation."
