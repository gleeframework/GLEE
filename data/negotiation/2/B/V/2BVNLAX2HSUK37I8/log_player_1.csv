"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but lower than my minimum ($15,000). This gives room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly tone encourages Bob to engage in the conversation. 
* **Value Proposition:**  Highlighting the ""great deal"" helps Bob see the potential benefits of buying. 

**Strategy:**

This initial offer aims to gauge Bob's interest while keeping the negotiation within my desired price range. If Bob rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10500 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While it's closer to my desired price, $10,500 is still below my minimum of $15,000.
* **Plenty of rounds left:** With 8 rounds remaining, I have time to negotiate further and potentially reach a better price.
* **John's offer is a strong alternative:**  If I don't see a better offer from Bob, I can always sell to John for my minimum.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum. My aim is to keep the negotiation moving towards my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a price above my minimum. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Reiterate the product's value:**  Reminding Bob of the value of the product reinforces the justification for my price.
* **Focus on finding a solution:** The message emphasizes finding a mutually agreeable solution, fostering a collaborative tone.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation moving towards my desired price range while still leaving room for further compromise if needed. The focus is on finding a balance between maximizing my earnings and reaching an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position. $11500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer and is closer to what I can afford. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $11,000 is still below my preferred price, it's a significant increase from Bob's initial offer and very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Compromise and progress:** Bob has shown willingness to compromise, and accepting his offer will secure a deal quickly.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I keep rejecting offers, I risk losing Bob as a buyer, potentially leaving me with only John's offer, which is my absolute minimum.

**Strategy:**

This is a good compromise that maximizes my earnings given Bob's budget limitations and the risk of losing the deal to John. Accepting this offer ensures a quick sale and a decent profit."
