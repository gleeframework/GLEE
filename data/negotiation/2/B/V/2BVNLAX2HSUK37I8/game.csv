"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10500 for it. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11500. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position. $11500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer and is closer to what I can afford. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,
