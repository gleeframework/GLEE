"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. While I do think the product is valuable, $9,000 is a bit over my budget.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a bit hesitant at $8,500. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the sale.",8250.0,Bob,4,
