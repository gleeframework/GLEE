"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its immense value, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum allows room for negotiation and makes concessions seem more substantial. 
* **Anchoring:**  The high initial price acts as an anchor, potentially influencing Bob's perception of the product's worth and his counteroffer.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While I'm aiming high, I'm mindful that I have the option to walk away and sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,600,000 is significantly above my budget.  Given my maximum is $800,000, I'd like to offer $850,000 as a starting point. This reflects the value I see in the product while remaining within my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. Accepting would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Rejecting his offer signals that I'm serious about the product's value and willing to negotiate further.  
* **John as Leverage:** I still have the option to sell to John, which gives me a strong position in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significantly Higher Counter:** I'm countering with a price much higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This signals that I'm willing to negotiate but not at a significant loss.
* **Justification:**  By stating the offer ""reflects the product's true worth,"" I'm reinforcing the product's value.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Suggesting a middle ground might seem reasonable to Bob and encourage him to make a more substantial counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm happy to split the difference from our previous offers and offer $1,100,000. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while respecting my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting this offer secures a profit.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While I could push for a higher price,  further negotiation might not yield a significantly better outcome. It's possible Bob won't go much higher.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids the risk of prolonged negotiations and ensures I receive payment promptly."
