"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it has the potential to be extremely valuable for you.  Given its unique qualities, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to that.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
