Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $9,500. I believe it represents excellent value and would be a great acquisition for you."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much as possible from the sale. Since Bob is willing to pay $8,000 and John guarantees $10,000, aiming for a price higher than $8,000 but lower than $10,000 maximizes potential profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting with $9,500 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. It's a strong initial offer that emphasizes the value of the product while still being potentially attractive to Bob. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having John as a backup buyer provides a strong bargaining position. It allows for a firm stance in negotiations, as selling for less than $10,000 is not necessary in a worst-case scenario."
