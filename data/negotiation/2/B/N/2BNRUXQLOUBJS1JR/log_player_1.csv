**Reasoning:**  While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, the negotiations are happening in small increments and it's unclear if he'll ultimately be willing to reach a price that's significantly better than John's guaranteed offer. Selling to John ensures you get your minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of further drawn-out negotiations with Bob."
