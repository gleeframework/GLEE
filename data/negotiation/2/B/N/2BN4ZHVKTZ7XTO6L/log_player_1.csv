Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $95. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering it slightly below Bob's maximum valuation ($95) increases the likelihood of him accepting while maximizing your potential profit. 

If Bob rejects the offer, you can always fall back on John's offer of $80."
