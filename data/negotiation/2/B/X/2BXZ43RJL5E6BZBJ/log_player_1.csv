"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,500,000, but it gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.  I want to see how Bob reacts to this initial price.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1775000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,775,000.  This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, demonstrating flexibility, but it still puts me above Bob's latest offer.  With fewer rounds remaining, I'm trying to find a compromise that both of us can agree on."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  We're getting close to the end of the negotiation, and while I'd prefer a higher price, $1,725,000 is still significantly above my minimum value. Accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation rounds leading to a lower price or losing the deal altogether."
