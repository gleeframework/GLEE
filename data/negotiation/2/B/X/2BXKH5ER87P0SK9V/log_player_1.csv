Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth to both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 leaves some space for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Secure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, selling at $1,400,000 or a bit lower is a substantial profit over John's offer of $1,200,000.
* **Confidence and Exclusivity:**  The tone of the message aims to convey the product's value and create a sense of exclusivity, making Bob more inclined to accept."
