Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's close to Bob's perceived value of the product ($12,000) but also gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  I'm also leaving the door open for further discussion, as I'm confident I can convince Bob that this is a good deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $12,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to accept his initial counteroffer. I'll aim for a price closer to my ideal value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This still gives you a good price, and it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $13,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000, which is a fair price considering how much we've both moved.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is still below my ideal price, it's a good compromise.  Bob has come up in his offer, and I'm confident that I can't get a much better price from him.  It's also important to consider that if I reject his offer, there's no guarantee that he'll come up further, and I might risk losing the deal altogether.  At this point, $13,000 is a good price, and it's best to close the deal."
