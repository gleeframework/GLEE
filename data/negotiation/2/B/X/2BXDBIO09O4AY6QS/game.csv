"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $12,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This still gives you a good price, and it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can agree on this.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $13,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000, which is a fair price considering how much we've both moved.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
