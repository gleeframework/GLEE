This offer gives Bob a good deal while still leaving you with a significant profit. It also leaves room for negotiation if he wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less for this product. Considering its value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I will counteroffer to keep the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $850,000 is unfortunately below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still gives you a significant benefit. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm open to further discussion."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price.  I'm willing to pay $875,000.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I believe it's a good price considering the value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $875,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. It's a good deal for me, and it seems like Bob is unlikely to go higher.  I'll accept his offer."
