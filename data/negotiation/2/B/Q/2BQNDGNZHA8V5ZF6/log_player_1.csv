Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to consider your product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $700,000 is too low, and I'm not willing to sell for less than what it's worth to me. I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about we settle on $850,000?  It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $775,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $775,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm going to counter with a slightly higher offer in the next round to try and close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but we're still not quite there yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay above $800,000. How about we settle on $825,000? This price would allow both of us to walk away with a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $825,000. I'll try to meet you halfway again. I'll offer $812,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $812,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal, Bob's offer of $812,500 is getting quite close to my minimum and a better deal than selling to John for $800,000. I'll accept this offer."
