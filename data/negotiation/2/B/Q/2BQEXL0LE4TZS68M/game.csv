"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. That starting price is quite high for me. I'm thinking closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a fair offer considering the product's potential.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we need to find some middle ground here. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,900,000 is still too high for me. How about we settle around $800,000?  This offer represents a significant investment on my part and a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I need to be fair to myself as well.  $800,000 is too low for me to consider. I'm willing to compromise significantly and drop to $1,600,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product while still providing you with a great opportunity.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
