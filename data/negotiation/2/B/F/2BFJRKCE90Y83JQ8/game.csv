"Hello Bob, I am delighted to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I'm offering it at $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's way out of my budget. This product holds value for me, but not at that price.  How about we bring it down to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the true worth and potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this revised price reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we need to find some middle ground here. While I understand this product has value, $1,800,000 is still far too high for me. Let's try $700,000.  I think that's a fair offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,500,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and reflects the absolute lowest I'm willing to go.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
