"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You want to save as much money as possible, and $11,500 is more than your target of $10,000. It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'd be happy to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking to get closer to my asking price.  How about $11,000? That leaves room for both of us to get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $11,000 is closer to your target, you're still a bit over. It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if you can bring Alice down to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to get closer to your asking price, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $10,750. This price is fair to both of us and allows us to close the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,750 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $11,000.  Would you be willing to meet me at $10,900? That would be a good compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You're getting close to your target price, but Alice is still holding out for a higher price.  At this point, it's probably better to just buy from John. You can get the product for your desired price and avoid the risk of the negotiation dragging on longer and potentially leading to a higher price."
