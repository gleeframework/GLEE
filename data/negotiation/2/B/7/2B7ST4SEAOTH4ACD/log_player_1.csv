Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'd be happy to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my asking price, I'm still hoping to get a little more. I'll counter with a price closer to my ideal amount and see if we can reach a compromise."
