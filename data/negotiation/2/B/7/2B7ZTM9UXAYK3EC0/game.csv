"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,750,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,400,000 is significantly below the product's true worth. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,600,000. This reflects the product's exceptional value and offers a fair price for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,550,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. ",1550000.0,Bob,4,
