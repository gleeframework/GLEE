"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting with a high price, $1,000,000.  This is a bold move, but I want to see if Bob is truly interested and willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate down, but I want to establish a high starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is close to my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $950,000.  This is a compromise, but it still leaves some room for Bob to negotiate if he's serious about buying.  I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $920,000 is a good price and is getting close to my ideal.  There's no guarantee that I can get a better offer in the remaining rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely."
