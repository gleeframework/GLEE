"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is within your budget, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  There's a significant gap between your maximum price ($1,500,000) and Alice's asking price ($1,200,000).  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and close that gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still well within your budget. This allows for some room for negotiation without immediately being unreasonable."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above your desired price point, but it's closer than her initial offer. There's still room for negotiation. Rejecting allows you to continue negotiating with Alice and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer increases your offer by $100,000, showing a willingness to compromise. It's still significantly lower than Alice's latest offer, giving her room to come down to meet you in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is getting very close to your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  While you could continue negotiating, the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Alice is increasing. Buying from John guarantees you get the product, even if it means paying a slightly higher price.  It's less risky and ensures you get the product you want within your budget."
