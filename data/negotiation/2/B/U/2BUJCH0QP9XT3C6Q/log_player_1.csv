Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000 is a good starting point:** It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000, giving me room to negotiate.
* **The message is positive and encouraging:**  It highlights the value of the product and emphasizes the potential for a good deal.
* **It leaves the door open for negotiation:** By asking for Bob's thoughts, I acknowledge the possibility of a counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest while ensuring I'm not giving away too much value too quickly. If Bob rejects, I can then assess if I want to continue negotiating with him or sell to John for a guaranteed $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $10,000 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum value of $15,000, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired range.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Maintain leverage:** Show Bob that I'm not desperate to sell at his price.
* **Explore potential for a better deal:** A counteroffer from me might incentivize Bob to increase his offer.
* **Avoid a quick sale:** Selling to John for $15,000 is always an option, but I want to see if I can maximize my earnings through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a price that's higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility while maintaining my desired profit margin.
* **Positive message:** I acknowledge Bob's offer and emphasize the desire for a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Fairness appeal:** I highlight the product's value to justify the price.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Test Bob's willingness to compromise:** If he's serious about buying the product, he might be willing to meet me halfway.
* **Increase my potential earnings:** $11,500 is closer to my goal of $15,000 than $10,000.
* **Keep the negotiation moving:** By offering a counteroffer, I'm showing Bob I'm actively engaged in finding a solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still unable to meet a price higher than $10,000. Could we perhaps find a middle ground at $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,500 is too far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, this offer is significantly lower than my desired profit margin and puts me at a considerable financial loss.  

**Strategy:**

Selling to John for $15,000 is the most sensible choice at this point. This ensures a guaranteed profit and avoids further rounds of negotiation that are likely to result in a price I'm not comfortable with.  While I'd prefer to sell at a higher price, maximizing my earnings is a priority, and John's offer provides the best outcome for me."
