"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think $13,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,000. Can you consider it?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $11,000 is a good offer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial value.  How about $12,000? It's a fair compromise and lets us both get a good deal.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,500. Can you consider it?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $11,500? This would be a good deal for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,5,
