"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think $13,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting, I still believe the product is worth more. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $11,000 is a good offer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial value.  How about $12,000? It's a fair compromise and lets us both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}

While $10,500 is tempting, I'm still determined to get closer to my initial asking price.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet. I'll counteroffer Bob in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $11,500? This would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is the same as what John is offering. Since I've already gone through several rounds of negotiations and haven't been able to get a better price from Bob, it's time to move on. I'll sell the product to John to secure the $10,000."
