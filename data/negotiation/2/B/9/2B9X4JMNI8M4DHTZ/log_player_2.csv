You can do better than $100.  Rejecting the offer gives you a chance to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

$95 is still a good deal for you, as it's below your maximum of $120 and not much more than your last counteroffer.  It's likely Alice won't go lower, so accepting is the best option."
