"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a compromise that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $750,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",750000.0,Alice,5,
