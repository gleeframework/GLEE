Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it at a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will pay the full $1,500,000, securing a deal with Bob quickly is advantageous.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,300,000 creates a significant profit margin for Alice ($500,000 profit) while still presenting a compelling offer to Bob.
* **Value Proposition:**  The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""fair deal"" to entice Bob, highlighting the product's potential value. 

This approach balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
