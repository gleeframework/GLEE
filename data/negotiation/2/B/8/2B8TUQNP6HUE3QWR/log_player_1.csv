Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $180. I believe it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 180
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value,"" Alice subtly implies the product is worth more than Bob might think, potentially justifying the higher price.
* **Open-ended Question:**  Ending with ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation, rather than just saying yes or no.

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright. However, since Alice has a guaranteed sale at $150 with John, it's worth aiming higher initially."
