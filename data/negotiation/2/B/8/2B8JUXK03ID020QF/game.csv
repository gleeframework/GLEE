,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm interested in the product but would need to see a lower price to consider it.  Would you be willing to sell it for $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be open to considering $12500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm ready to pay $11000 for the product.  Let me know if that's acceptable.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I'd like to propose a compromise. How about we meet at $11500?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.  I'm still not comfortable with $11500.  Would you consider $11250 as a final offer?  I'm really trying to stay within my budget.",11250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. I can do $11750, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",11750.0,Alice,7,
