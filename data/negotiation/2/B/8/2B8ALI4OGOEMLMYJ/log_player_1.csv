Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $900,000, a price that reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $900,000 creates a win-win situation if Bob accepts:
    * You earn $100,000 more than selling to John.
    * Bob saves $100,000 compared to its value to him ($800,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $900,000, there might be room to negotiate slightly downward if Bob counters, but staying above your $1,000,000 baseline."
