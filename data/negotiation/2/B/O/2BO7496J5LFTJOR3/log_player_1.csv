"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation and a good profit for me. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to Bob to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $10,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is a decent offer, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to try for a better deal. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $11,000? It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 
I'm going to compromise a bit by lowering my price to $11,000. This keeps the offer higher than Bob's initial counter but shows flexibility.  I'll also emphasize a ""win-win"" scenario to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to offer $9,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price.  I'm not ready to sell to John just yet.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, $9,500 is getting closer, but I'm still holding out for a little more.  Let's split the difference - $10,250. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

I'm going to offer a compromise price of $10,250, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. This demonstrates flexibility and shows that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm also reiterating the value of the product to encourage Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your persistence. I am willing to pay $9,750 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's tempting to accept, I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price. I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price in the next round. It's not worth risking selling to John for a lower price when I'm so close to a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9,750. To close this deal, let's meet in the middle at $10,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob $10,000, which is the midpoint between our last two offers. This shows that I'm serious about closing the deal but also that I'm willing to compromise.  I'm hoping this final counteroffer will be enough to close the deal."
