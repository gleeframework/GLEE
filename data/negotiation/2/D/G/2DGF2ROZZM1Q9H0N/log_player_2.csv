{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now above Bob's maximum price of $12,000. It's unlikely that further negotiation will lead to a price Bob is willing to pay. Therefore, Bob should buy the product from John for $12,000 to secure the purchase within his budget."
