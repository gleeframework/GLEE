"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is tempting, you know you have a fallback option with John for $1,000,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price or see if she's willing to come down further. You haven't lost anything yet, as you still have the option to buy from John."
