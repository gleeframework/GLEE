"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $125. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is selling for $125, while John is selling for $150.
* **You're still getting a good deal:** You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice's offer is below that."
