"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd like to buy the product for $12,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your original offer and my budget of $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",12800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $12,800 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,200.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to what I need.  What do you think?",13200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $13,200. I'd like to buy the product for $12,600. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I hope you can consider it. Let me know what you think.",12600.0,Bob,4,
