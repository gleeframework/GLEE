Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think you'll find it valuable. I'm asking for $90, let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product for $90 is a strong starting point. It's a price that:
    * Allows you to potentially make more profit than selling to John.
    * Is still attractive to Bob as it's significantly less than his perceived value ($80).
* **Open Communication:** The message is friendly and suggests a negotiation possibility, which could be beneficial if Bob counters."
