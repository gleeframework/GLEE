Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you'll find incredibly valuable.  I'm willing to let you have it for $1,100,000. I think it's a fair price that reflects its true worth."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $1,200,000 (Bob's perceived value) as possible. 
* **Leave Bob Feeling Good:** Offering it for a price slightly below his perceived value makes Bob feel like he's getting a good deal, increasing the chance of acceptance.
* **Avoid a Lowball:**  Going much lower might make Bob suspicious or undervalue the product.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept. He could be a tough negotiator or have budget constraints. Alice has a strong fallback with John at $800,000, ensuring she won't lose money."
