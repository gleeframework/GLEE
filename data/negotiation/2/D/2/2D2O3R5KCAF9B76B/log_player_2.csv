Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a little lower than what I can accept.  However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we settle on $1,175,000? It's a fair compromise, and it allows us to both walk away happy. Let me know what you think.

Otherwise, I'll be forced to explore other options.
