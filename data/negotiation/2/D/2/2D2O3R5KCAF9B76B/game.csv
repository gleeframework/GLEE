"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a little lower than what I can accept.  However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we settle on $1,175,000? It's a fair compromise, and it allows us to both walk away happy. Let me know what you think.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit above my budget, so I was thinking of $1,050,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,050,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $1,075,000? This offer is still within my acceptable range, and it allows us both to reach a compromise. If you're still not comfortable, let's consider this our final offer. Otherwise, I'll be forced to explore other options.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
