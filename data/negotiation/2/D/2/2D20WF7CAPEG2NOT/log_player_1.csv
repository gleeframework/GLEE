Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think it would be a valuable addition to your collection."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** $115 is a good starting point as it's above your minimum price of $100 and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  This price gives Bob a reason to counteroffer, allowing for a potential win-win situation.
* **John as Backup:** The knowledge of John's offer ($100) provides a safety net. If Bob's counteroffers go too low, you can always accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $110. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a Better Price:** Bob's counteroffer is closer to your desired price of $115. Rejecting his offer allows for further negotiation.
* **Negotiation Power:** By rejecting his offer, you demonstrate your willingness to hold out for a better price. This could influence Bob to increase his offer in the next round.
* **Avoiding a Loss:** While selling to John for $100 is safe, it's less profitable than what Bob might be willing to pay. 

**Next Step:** You should now send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $115."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $112.50, which is still a great price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 112.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to my initial price of $115. This shows that I'm open to negotiation, but I'm also not willing to sell at a price that's too low.
* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm proposing to meet Bob halfway, which is a common negotiating tactic. It makes the offer seem fair and reasonable.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product. This helps justify the price and could encourage him to accept. 

**Next Step:** Now, I'll wait for Bob's response and see if he's willing to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $110 again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  Bob has returned to his initial counteroffer of $110. Further negotiation seems unlikely to result in a higher price.
* **Minimizing Loss:**  While $110 is less than my initial asking price of $115, it's still higher than selling to John for $100. 
* **Time Factor:**  Continuing to negotiate might prolong the process, potentially costing me time and potentially leading to another buyer appearing. 

**Conclusion:** It's better to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale at a price that's still profitable for me."
