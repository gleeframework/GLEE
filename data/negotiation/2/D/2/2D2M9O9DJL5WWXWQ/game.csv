"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at over $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1,200,000.  This reflects its significant value and potential for your business. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1,200,000 is above my budget.  To show my serious interest, I'm willing to offer $850,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for both of us, and I'm open to further discussion.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,025,000.  This price reflects the significant value I've placed on this product and allows for some flexibility on my end. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price in this round.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,025,000 is still a stretch for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I'm hoping we can reach a deal in this round.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $900,000, but I'm still a bit away from my desired price point. To make a deal happen, I'm willing to offer the product for $950,000. This is a compromise on my part, but it's the lowest I can go right now.  Let's close this deal in this round!",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $950,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to meet you at $925,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can close the deal in this round.",925000.0,Bob,6,
