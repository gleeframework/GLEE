I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000.  This gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary.  It's important to start high, especially since I don't know Bob's valuation of the product.  If he rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm not willing to settle for that yet. I'll counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's a reasonable compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. Hopefully, this will be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, and I'm happy to accept it.  $1,250,000 is a good price, and I don't want to risk losing him and having to settle for the lower price from John."
