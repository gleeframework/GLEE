"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the unique opportunity you're presenting. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to $1500000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise between the value of the product and what I am willing to invest.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1500000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000, which still allows me some room to profit.  This represents a significant reduction from my original offer.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
