"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the unique opportunity you're presenting. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to $1500000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise between the value of the product and what I am willing to invest. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's at my minimum, I believe there's room to negotiate higher. I'll try to get closer to my initial asking price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,500,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000, which still allows me some room to profit.  This represents a significant reduction from my original offer.  Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value I see in the product, I would like to propose a price of $1600000. I hope this aligns better with our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,600,000 is a good compromise and ensures a sale.  I don't want to risk losing Bob as a buyer and having to settle with John for a lower price."
