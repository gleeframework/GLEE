**Reasoning:** Bob is increasing his offers in smaller increments now, and we're still significantly below John's offer.  It's unlikely Bob will reach a price that's significantly more appealing than what John is already offering.  Cutting negotiations short and selling to John guarantees the $1,000,000 and avoids the risk of Bob not reaching an acceptable price within the remaining rounds."
