"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a strategic move for a few reasons:

* **Sets a High Bar:**  It establishes a strong initial expectation and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Gauges Bob's Interest:** If Bob is truly interested in the product, he'll likely counteroffer, giving me insight into his perceived value. 
* **Time to Assess:**  It gives me a chance to assess if Bob is a serious buyer or just trying to get a bargain.

If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can get more.  

* **Potential for Higher Value:** There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay more, especially if he's truly interested.
* **Negotiation Power:**  By rejecting, I show that I'm not desperate to sell at the minimum price.  This strengthens my position in the negotiation.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:**  His offer provides insight into his perceived value of the product. 

I'll use this information to craft a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

My counteroffer is $1,750,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation. 

Here's my reasoning:

* **Middle Ground:** This price is a midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, signaling a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining Value:** It's above my minimum price, ensuring I don't sell for less than what the product is worth to me.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge how committed Bob is to buying the product and what his upper limit might be.

By offering a slightly lower price, I aim to encourage Bob to counteroffer again, allowing me to further assess his value and potentially secure a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is now below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I am considering selling to John for that price, I'm not desperate to close the deal right now. 

* **Potential for Improvement:** I believe there's still a chance Bob will increase his offer, especially since he's already shown interest in the product. 
* **Leveraging John's Offer:** Knowing that I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 gives me leverage in negotiations with Bob.
* **Understanding Bob's Limits:**  By rejecting his offer, I get a better understanding of his true buying power. 

I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round, hoping to push Bob to accept or to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a calculated move:

* **Compromise:**  It's a lower price than my previous offer, showing flexibility, but still above my minimum.
* **Testing Bob's Resolve:** It's a ""final offer"" approach, giving Bob one more chance to come closer to my desired price.
* **Timing is Key:** With only 5 rounds remaining, it's important to start closing the deal.

If Bob rejects this offer, I will strongly consider selling to John in the next round to avoid wasting time.  However, I'll still be open to a very strong counteroffer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's latest offer is far too low. It's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement that's beneficial for me.  

* **Time is Running Out:** We're down to only four rounds, and it's unlikely Bob will drastically change his offer.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price.
* **Risk of Losing More:** Continuing negotiations with Bob risks losing more time and potentially ending up with a lower price.

Therefore, it's in my best interest to sell to John and secure the $1,500,000.  This ensures I don't lose out on the opportunity to earn at least my minimum price."
