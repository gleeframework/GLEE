"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $600000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800000. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a fair starting point. What do you think?",600000.0,Alice,1,
