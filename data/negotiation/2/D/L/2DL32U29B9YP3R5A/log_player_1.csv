Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell for $120. I will counteroffer to try to reach a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm countering with $175. This is still above my minimum, but a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate. It's also closer to his offer, potentially making him more likely to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now my minimum acceptable price.  It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for the same price.  There's no guarantee of getting a better offer in the future, so I'll accept his offer and finalize the deal."
