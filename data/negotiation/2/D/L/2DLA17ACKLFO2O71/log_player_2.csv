"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $7,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

It's in your best interest to try and get a lower price.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially save more money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250.

While it would be nice to push for a lower price, Alice has already come down from her initial offer. At this point, accepting her offer is the best option to save money compared to buying from John."
