"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",7250.0,Alice,3,
