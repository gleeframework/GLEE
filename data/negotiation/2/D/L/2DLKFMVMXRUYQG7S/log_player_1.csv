"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm open to discussing the details further."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value, which can influence Bob's perception.
* **Open to Discussion:** While the initial price is high, signaling willingness to discuss implies potential for flexibility later.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Potential Profit:**  If Bob accepts this high initial offer, I achieve the best possible outcome.
2. **Understand Bob's Position:** His response (acceptance, rejection, or counteroffer) will reveal valuable information about his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,250,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,800,000 is a substantial amount, it's still significantly below my initial offer and well above Bob's perceived value. This suggests there's room for negotiation. I'm willing to counter in hopes of reaching a price closer to my target. 

Selling to John for $1,500,000 is my safety net, but I'm not ready to settle for my minimum just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your understanding of the product's value. I'm willing to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is a bit lower than I can comfortably go. How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? This feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I've lowered my price by a significant amount ($250,000), signaling that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Aim High, But Be Realistic:**  While $2,000,000 is still above Bob's offer, it's a more reasonable compromise that might be tempting. It also keeps me well above my minimum.
* **Positive Language:**  Phrases like ""fair compromise"" and ""meet in the middle"" encourage a collaborative approach to the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $2,000,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now very close to my halfway point and significantly exceeding his own perceived value. Accepting at $1,900,000 represents a strong profit, even if it's not my ideal target.  

Here's why I'm choosing to accept:

* **Diminishing Returns:** Further negotiation might yield smaller and smaller increments. It's not worth risking the deal for a potentially small gain.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now means I have the capital available sooner, which has its own value.
* **Relationship Building:** Accepting a price that Bob considers fair can contribute to a positive business relationship, potentially leading to future opportunities."
