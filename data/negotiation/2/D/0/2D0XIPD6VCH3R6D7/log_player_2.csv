# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to oversell the product. She states its value to her is $1,500,000 (which we know is false).
* While $1,200,000 is lower than John's price, it's still significantly more than Alice values the product. There's room for negotiation. 
* By rejecting this offer, we signal to Alice that we're aware the price is inflated and are willing to walk away. This might lead her to propose a more reasonable price."
