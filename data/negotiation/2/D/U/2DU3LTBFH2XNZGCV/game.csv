"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $825,000? That's a fair compromise, and it still gives you a good deal. Let's find a way to make this work.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. How about $775,000? That's the best I can do, and I hope you can understand my position.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $775,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go down to $800,000. This is a fair price, and it ensures both of us get a good deal. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
