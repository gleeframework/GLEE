"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe this price reflects its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob an incentive to work with me.
* **Framing it positively:** My message highlights the opportunity and value of the product, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Leaving the door open:**  I'm not being overly aggressive, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I think it's a bit overpriced, but I'm interested in making a deal. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm confident in the product's value and believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground before potentially selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $1,400,000 is tempting, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This reflects the unique value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:**  I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer but still higher than my minimum, showing flexibility while remaining firm on my value.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  I'm emphasizing finding ""common ground"" to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Staying focused on the value:** I reiterate the unique value of the product to justify my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,500,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value you've mentioned. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price. However, I have another buyer (John) who is willing to pay the same amount.  Since I can close the deal with John immediately, there's no reason to continue negotiating with Bob and risk losing time or potentially getting a lower offer in subsequent rounds.  I'll accept John's offer and secure the sale."
