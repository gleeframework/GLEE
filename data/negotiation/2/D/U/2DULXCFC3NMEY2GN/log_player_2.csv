"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  While $10,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get an even better price by negotiating with Alice. There's no indication that Alice is desperate to sell, so Bob has room to bargain."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a great starting point, but I'm looking to spend a little less.  I'd be happy to buy it for $8,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable with the $8500 price point. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $9250. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value I know this product holds. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $9,250 is better than her original offer, Bob can likely still get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  He's already shown a willingness to compromise, and Alice has also shown a willingness to move.  A counteroffer closer to $9,000 might be successful."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  Let's try to bridge the gap a bit more. I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $9000, but I'm still not sure if I can go any lower. I'm going to throw in a sweetener - I'll include a complimentary service that's usually valued at $1000. This way, you'll get even more value out of the product. I'm still at $9000, but I think this additional perk makes it a more compelling offer. What do you think?

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he initially aimed for a price closer to $8,500, Alice has shown a willingness to compromise and has even added a valuable bonus in the form of a complimentary service.  Accepting the offer at $9,000, especially with the added value, is a good outcome for Bob and saves him $3,000 compared to buying from John."
