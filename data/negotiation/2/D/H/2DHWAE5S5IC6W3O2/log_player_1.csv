"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value, aiming to see if Bob is willing to negotiate.  I'm confident I can get at least $15,000 from John, so I'm not afraid to be bold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for a price that undervalues my product.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still holding firm. I'm hoping this shows Bob I'm serious about negotiating while still maintaining a fair price for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still offering a price that's too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for a price that undervalues my product. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm making a small concession, moving closer to Bob's offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price that's fair to me. I'm getting close to my minimum and would like to see if this small adjustment will be enough to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached an impasse.  Bob is unwilling to move on his price, and I'm unwilling to go lower than $13,500.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John. While I would have preferred to get a slightly higher price, I'm still getting my minimum value and avoiding further negotiation."
