"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $16,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  It makes more sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. While it's closer, Bob can still potentially negotiate a lower price or buy from John for his desired price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows for more bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  While it's only $1,500 more than Bob's target, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob is better off rejecting the offer and seeing if he can get a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, but he also doesn't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  Alice has already moved closer to his desired price, so this counteroffer is a compromise: it's closer to Alice's last offer, showing willingness to meet her halfway, but still within Bob's budget."
