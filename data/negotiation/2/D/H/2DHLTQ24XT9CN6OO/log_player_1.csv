"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1150000} 

This is a strong opening offer, leaving room for negotiation while still reflecting the product's significant value to me. I believe Bob will be interested in purchasing the product at this price, as it's still lower than the value he assigns to it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round. I believe I can negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm on a price that reflects the product's value. I believe this counteroffer is reasonable and will incentivize Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, his offer is below the minimum I'm comfortable accepting.  I've already had three rounds of negotiation and it's clear he's not willing to meet my price. Selling to John at this point is the best option to ensure I get a decent return for the product,  given the limited rounds remaining."
