"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. There's room to negotiate a better price, especially since you have John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $90 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

This counter-offer aims to anchor the negotiation closer to my target price. Starting low gives me room to negotiate upwards while staying below my $100 limit and John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $82? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is negotiating, which is good, but $82 is still above my target price.  I'll try to inch closer to $70."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about $75? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy if you agree."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

This counteroffer shows Alice I'm willing to move towards her price, but I'm still aiming for a good deal. By stating I'm ready to buy at $75, it adds a bit of pressure for her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob! However, I still need to make a bit more profit. How about we meet in the middle again? I can offer it to you for $79. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $79
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly motivated to sell. While $79 is slightly above my ideal price, it's a good deal compared to John's offer of $100. I'm better off accepting now before Alice potentially raises the price again."
