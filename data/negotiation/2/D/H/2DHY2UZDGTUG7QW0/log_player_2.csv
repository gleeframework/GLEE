"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it would be a perfect fit for your needs. We're confident it could add significant value to your business. Let's discuss a fair price. Our initial offer is $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum price point. While the product might be valuable, it's not worth paying over $1,000,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's potential, $1,200,000 is slightly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for considering our product, Bob. We understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of that, we would like to propose a counteroffer of $1100000 for the product. We believe this price reflects its value while remaining within your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above Bob's target price of $1,000,000. While it's closer, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer keeps the door open for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still beyond my comfortable spending limit.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000.  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We've reviewed your offer and are pleased to present a counteroffer of $1075000 for the product. We believe this price is fair and reflects the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it still exceeds his maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Since Bob has the option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, it is the most logical choice to avoid further negotiation and secure the product at the best possible price."
