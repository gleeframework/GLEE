Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Considering your latest offer, I propose a price of $82 for the product. This allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while being competitive with your offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but she's moving in small increments. While we could try to haggle further, the potential savings are getting smaller. Accepting at $82 secures a decent discount and avoids the risk of the negotiation breaking down, forcing us to buy from John at full price."
