"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This is a strong opening position that allows for a good chance of securing a profitable deal. I'm aiming for a compromise price that's favorable to me but also appealing enough for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,050,000 is a decent price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price with Bob, or alternatively, sell to John for a more favorable amount.  Therefore, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer to show flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but still maintaining a price significantly above Bob's last offer. This counteroffer keeps the pressure on Bob while acknowledging that a compromise may be necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is inching closer to my desired price, it's still not enough.  I believe that with a few more rounds of negotiation, I can push Bob to a more agreeable price. I also have the security of John's offer to fall back on if the negotiations with Bob ultimately fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1090000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm continuing to lower the price to show good faith and encourage Bob to come closer to my target. This offer is still well above Bob's last offer, but it demonstrates my willingness to compromise and reach an agreement. I'm confident that Bob will accept or at least counter with a closer price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

We are now nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating, there is a risk that we will run out of rounds and I will be forced to accept a price that is less than ideal.  To guarantee that I receive my minimum desired price, I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000.  This ensures I get the best possible outcome for my product."
