Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. I know you'll recognize its immense value. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  What are your thoughts?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your understanding, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. I'm confident that this price is fair considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. We have plenty of room to negotiate and eight rounds remaining.  We'll reject his offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $1,075,000?"",
""product_price"": 1075000
}
``` 

We're holding firm but showing a willingness to negotiate by moving to a price closer to the middle ground. This demonstrates flexibility while aiming to secure a price closer to the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is moving too slowly upwards while we're already making concessions.  We need to signal that his valuations are too far off base.  We'll reject and counter, but selling to John is becoming a real possibility if Bob doesn't make a significant jump."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be upfront.  $950,000 is simply too far from what I consider a fair deal.  To move forward, I need to see you significantly closer to my valuation. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, but this is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
``` 

Explanation:

* **Firmness:** We're drawing a line in the sand. This emphasizes that Bob's offers are not in the realm of serious consideration.
* **Slight Concession:** The drop to $1,050,000 shows we're still negotiating, but it's a small concession to avoid completely stalling the talks.
* **Ultimatum (Final Offer):** This introduces a sense of urgency and tells Bob it's time for him to be realistic. He needs to make a substantial jump to continue the negotiation. 

We're getting close to the point where John's offer becomes more appealing. Bob needs to respond strategically in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $975,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle again. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

Explanation:

* **Stalled Negotiations:**  Bob's offer of $975,000 shows he's unwilling or unable to move significantly closer to our valuation. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob has a higher risk of ending without a deal.  The longer we wait, the more we risk losing John's guaranteed $1,000,000.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer is below our desired price, but it ensures a substantial profit. It's time to cut our losses with Bob and take the sure thing."
