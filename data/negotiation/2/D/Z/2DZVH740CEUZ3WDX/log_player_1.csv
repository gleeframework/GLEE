Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its inherent value and the benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming higher with Bob could yield a better return. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,300,000 is significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** The safety net of John's offer allows us to confidently aim high with Bob, knowing we have a backup plan. 

**The Message:**

* It's framed positively, emphasizing ""opportunity"" and ""value.""
*  The price is presented as a ""proposal"" open to discussion, not a rigid demand. 

This approach gives us the best chance of securing a higher price from Bob while still ensuring a successful sale."
