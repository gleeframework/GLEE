"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I'm still quite interested, but $1,600,000 is a bit beyond what I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position.  However, I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to go down to $1,550,000, but that's my final offer.  This price reflects the true value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  What do you think?",1550000.0,Alice,5,
