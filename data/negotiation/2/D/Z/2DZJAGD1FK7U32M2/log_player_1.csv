Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Let me know what you think.

You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I'm still quite interested, but $1,600,000 is a bit beyond what I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $1,350,000?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  However, I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to go down to $1,550,000, but that's my final offer.  This price reflects the true value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1550000}
