Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  However, I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to go down to $1,550,000, but that's my final offer.  This price reflects the true value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is unlikely to go below $1,550,000.  Since you can get the product for $1,500,000 from John, it's more beneficial to cut your losses and buy from him."
