"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This still leaves some room for negotiation, and I'm confident this is a fair price given the value you'll receive from the product.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're looking to make a profit, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,750 for the product. I think this is a fair price based on my research and my budget. What do you think?",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a bit higher. How about $10,900? It's a good middle ground and we'd both be getting a fair deal. Let's try to close this gap and make this happen.",10900.0,Alice,5,
