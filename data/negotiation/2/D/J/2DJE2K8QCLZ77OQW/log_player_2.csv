Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering. That said, $600,000 significantly undervalues the potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $1,100,000?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to find a price we can both agree on. While $750,000 is still lower than I'd like, I'm willing to consider it if you're willing to meet me a bit higher.  How about $900,000? This feels like a fair compromise.
