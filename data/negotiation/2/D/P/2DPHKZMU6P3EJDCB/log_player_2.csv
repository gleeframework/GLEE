"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let's get this done! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. Rejecting it allows you to negotiate a better price without immediately resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only consider a price closer to  $800,000."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower counter-offer gives you room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below both Alice's initial offer and your maximum budget. This strategy aims to understand Alice's flexibility and potential for a mutually beneficial deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's keep this conversation going! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down from her initial offer, but it's still above your maximum budget.  There's room for further negotiation, and you haven't reached a point where John's offer is the better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be honest, my absolute limit is closer to $1,000,000.  If you're willing to work in that range, I'm ready to make a deal."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:** It's time to signal your maximum budget to Alice. This creates a sense of urgency and transparency,  showing her you're serious but have limitations.  It also allows her to make an informed decision about whether to continue negotiating or move on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not able to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting closer to your maximum, but there's still a chance to negotiate further. A counteroffer slightly below your maximum might encourage her to finalize the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit, but $1,200,000 is pushing it. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? That's the best I can do."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  You're offering a price slightly below your maximum budget, showing Alice you're willing to compromise but also indicating your limit. This leaves some room for Alice to potentially counter with a price closer to your maximum while still getting a better deal than John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,150,000. It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. Let's seal the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is very close to your absolute limit, but you still have a few rounds to try and get a slightly better price. There's a chance she might be willing to come down a little more, especially if you signal that this is your final offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, this is really my limit. I can do $1,125,000, but that's absolutely as high as I can go.  If we can make this work, I'm ready to close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  You're signaling a firm final offer, splitting the difference between Alice's last offer and your previous one. This shows you're still trying to find a compromise but also emphasizes that you're reaching your absolute limit. The urgency of closing the deal today adds pressure for Alice to accept."
