"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $820,000 is simply too low to justify the value I've invested in this product.  I'm willing to come down to $880,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's work together to make this deal happen.",880000.0,Alice,3,
