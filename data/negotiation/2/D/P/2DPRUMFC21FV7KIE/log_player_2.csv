{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you taking the time to discuss this. While I see the value in your product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  This price would allow me to acquire the product while staying within my budget.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,175,000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's value, but also acknowledges your budget constraints.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,175,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still aiming for a slightly lower price. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, ensuring a successful transaction.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm offering the product to you for $1,125,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer is $1,125,000, which is still a good deal for you, considering your maximum budget is $1,500,000.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away and you'll have to buy from John at a significantly higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer secures the product for a price that is within your budget and provides a better return than buying from John."
