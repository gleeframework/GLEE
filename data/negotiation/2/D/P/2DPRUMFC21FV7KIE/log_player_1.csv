Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you taking the time to discuss this. While I see the value in your product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  This price would allow me to acquire the product while staying within my budget.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
