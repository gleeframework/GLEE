Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $115 is above your minimum of $100, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's value:**  $115 is below Bob's value of $120, giving him some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It opens the door for negotiation:**  The message invites Bob to respond and start the negotiation process.

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is a decent offer and a gain for you, it's still below the potential of getting closer to $120. You're willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? That would be a fair compromise for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $110 is closer, but I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. How about $108? That's a fair bit closer to your price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $108 is still below the potential of $110, it's a small difference and you're already close to Bob's valuation.  Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a decent profit, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether."
