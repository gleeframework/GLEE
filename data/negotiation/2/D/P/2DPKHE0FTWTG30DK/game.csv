"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested in that price.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,500 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to the value I'm willing to pay.  Let's see if we can close the deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
