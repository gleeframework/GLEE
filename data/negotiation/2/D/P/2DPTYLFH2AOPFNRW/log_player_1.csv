Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it offers significant value, but I understand this is a significant investment. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have room to negotiate with Bob. Starting with a higher offer of $19,000 allows you to potentially maximize your profit. 
* **Justification:** The message implies the product's value might be even higher than $19,000, subtly anchoring Bob's perception.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message acknowledges the price is high and invites Bob to share his thoughts, opening the door for potential counter-offers. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening strategy. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. If he outright rejects the initial offer, you can gradually lower the price, but never go below your $15,000 baseline."
