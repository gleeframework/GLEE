"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting point. This product would be valuable to me, but closer to $700,000.  Would you consider an offer in that range?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective. However, the value of this product is truly significant.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  To be honest, $1,100,000 is still quite a ways away from what I had in mind. I can go up to $750,000, but I need to see some more flexibility on your end to make this work.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect that. While $750,000 is too low, I'm willing to consider a significantly lower price if it means closing this deal. Let's meet halfway at $925,000.  This offer reflects my strong desire to find a solution that works for both of us.",925000.0,Alice,5,
