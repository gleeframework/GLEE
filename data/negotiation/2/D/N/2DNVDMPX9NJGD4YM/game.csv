,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's a more reasonable price for me.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate.  However, $100 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $105, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, and I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $108? It's a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal.",108.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but $108 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $102, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price?",102.0,Bob,6,
