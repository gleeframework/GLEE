"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This leaves some room for negotiation, but it's also a significant profit for me. I'm hoping to get as close to Bob's value of $12,000 as possible without jeopardizing my minimum desired profit of $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's above my minimum threshold of $10,000, it's still significantly lower than the $11,500 I offered initially. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to take the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $11,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. However, I'm still aiming for a significant profit while remaining within Bob's perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum desired profit of $10,000 and closer to my initial asking price than John's offer. Continuing to negotiate with Bob could potentially lead to a better price, but it also risks losing the deal entirely. At this point, I'm willing to take the $10,750 to secure the sale."
