"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm framing the offer in a positive and encouraging way to increase Bob's interest. 
* **Focus on Value:** I emphasize the product's value to Bob, hoping to make him more willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.**  While he's shown interest, I'm not willing to accept a deal that undervalues the product for me. 
* **There's still room for negotiation.**  We have 8 rounds left, and I can continue to try and find a price that works for both of us. 
* **Selling to John is a guaranteed profit.**  However, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price with Bob, and I'm willing to continue negotiating for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  That seems like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price in the middle of our current positions. This shows flexibility and willingness to find a solution.
* **Maintain a Positive Tone:**  I keep the message friendly and encouraging to maintain a positive negotiation dynamic.
* **Focus on Fairness:** I frame my counteroffer as a fair compromise, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  $10,500 is above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, so I'm not sacrificing my own interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **We're getting closer:** While Bob hasn't met my price yet, he's showing increasing willingness to negotiate. 
* **I have time:** We have six rounds left. I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly below my desired price, especially when I know I can sell to John for a much higher amount.  
* **Counteroffers can be more effective than accepting.** By rejecting this offer and making a counteroffer, I can potentially push Bob even closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your willingness to go up, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000 as a final offer.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll find it a very worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm positioning this as my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to make a decision.
* **Slight Compromise:** I'm coming down from my previous offer, showing a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reinforcing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to sway him.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  $10,000 is above my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not compromising my own interests. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  By making a final offer, I'm hoping to push Bob towards accepting or making a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $10,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. Can you meet me at $9,500 or consider other options? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We have only 4 rounds left, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Risk of losing out:**  If I continue to negotiate, I risk running out of time and having to accept a lower price than I'd like, or even having Bob walk away.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired price of $15,000. This is the most sensible and risk-free option at this point.

While I'd prefer to close a deal with Bob, it's more important to secure a profitable sale and ensure I don't lose out on a much better offer."
