"Alice, your product is fantastic, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This price is still a good deal for you, as it's significantly more than what the product is worth to you. Let's work together to make this deal happen.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your offer, but I must respectfully decline it. We value our product highly due to its unique features and exceptional quality. Considering this, I would like to propose an alternative offer of $900,000. This price aligns more closely with the perceived value of the product to us, while still being a fair deal for you. I hope we can continue our discussion towards reaching a satisfactory agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  This shows a significant commitment from my end, and I believe we can close this deal. Let's find common ground and make this work.",875000.0,Bob,4,
