Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, especially considering it would cost you significantly more to develop something similar yourself."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to earn as much as possible, and Bob is willing to pay more than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.  
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price. 
* **Backup Plan:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I still have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000.

By offering the product at $1,400,000, I'm aiming for a price that's beneficial for me while still being attractive enough for Bob to accept."
