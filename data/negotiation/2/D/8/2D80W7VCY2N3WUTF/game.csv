"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $180?",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $180 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $120.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,

"I'm still not sure if $120 is a good price for me, but I'm willing to compromise further. How about we meet at $200? I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.",200.0,Alice,5,
