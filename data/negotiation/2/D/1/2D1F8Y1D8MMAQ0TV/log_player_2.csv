"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $11,500 is better than John's price of $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $10,500 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to consider it. After reevaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth to me.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $1,000 less than John's price**, making it a more attractive option for Bob.
* **Bob's goal is to save money**, and accepting this offer saves him $500 compared to buying from John.
* While there might be some room for further negotiation, the risk of losing the deal to John outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
