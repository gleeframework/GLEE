"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. I would be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and its worth to me.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $900,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. How about we settle at $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
