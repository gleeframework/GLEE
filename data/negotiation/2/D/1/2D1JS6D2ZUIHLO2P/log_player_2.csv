"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to my limit ($10,000), but I want to see if I can get a better price.** 
* **Rejecting allows me to counteroffer and potentially save some money.** 
* **I'm not ready to buy from John yet as there's room for negotiation with Alice.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.**
* **$8,500 is still within my budget and leaves room for potential compromise.**
* **My message is polite and expresses my interest, but also highlights my price limit.**"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $8,750.  It's a fair compromise and allows us to close the deal without either of us having to budge too much."", ""product_price"": 8750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **I'm trying to meet Alice in the middle again, but this time with a smaller difference.**
* **$8,750 is still within my budget, and it shows that I'm genuinely interested in finding a deal.**
* **My message reiterates my interest in buying the product and emphasizes the compromise aspect.**"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum target price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $8800. It's a slight increase from your offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now within my budget and is close to my previous counteroffer.** 
* **Accepting the offer allows me to buy the product for a good price and avoid further negotiation.**
* **While I might be able to potentially get a slightly lower price with more rounds, the risk of Alice walking away or me having to buy from John at $10,000 isn't worth it.**"
