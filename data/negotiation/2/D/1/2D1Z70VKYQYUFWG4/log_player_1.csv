Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** $1,200,000 is a good starting point as it's well above your minimum of $800,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There is still a $300,000 gap between your offer and Bob's perceived value, allowing for some negotiation.
* **It demonstrates your confidence:**  Starting high shows that you believe your product is valuable and you're not afraid to ask for a good price.

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is a good amount, it's still far below the value I believe the product holds.  I want to push for a higher price, especially since Bob clearly sees the value in the product. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my initial goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's lower than my initial offer but still significantly higher than Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but I'm also confident in the product's value.  I'm aiming for a price that is more equitable and hopefully motivates Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's latest offer of $1,000,000 is a good compromise. It's a significant profit for me, and it seems like we've reached a point where further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether.  It's time to accept and move on."
