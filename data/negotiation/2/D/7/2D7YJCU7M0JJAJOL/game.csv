"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget.  $1,200,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is still a bit above my target. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,250,000?  It's a fair price that would allow us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a compromise.  $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $1,280,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1280000.0,Alice,5,
