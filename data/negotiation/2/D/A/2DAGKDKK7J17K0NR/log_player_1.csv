Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $150.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point.  It's above your minimum price of $120, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob isn't willing to pay that much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum price of $120.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $130? That's still a good deal for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about $115?  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $115 is still less than my minimum of $120, it's getting closer. If I reject this offer, Bob might get frustrated and walk away. It's better to accept his offer now and secure a sale, as John is only offering $120."
