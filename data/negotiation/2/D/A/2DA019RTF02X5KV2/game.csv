"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $900000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000.  This price still gives you a great deal, and it allows me to achieve a reasonable return on my investment. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $950000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
