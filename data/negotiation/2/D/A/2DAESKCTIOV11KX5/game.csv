"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While that price is tempting, I'm looking to invest a bit less in this particular product. Would you be open to a price closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you while also being more competitive than my initial offer.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,050,000 is closer, but to make this work on my end, I'd need to be closer to $900,000.  Would that be something you'd consider?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000.

This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you while also being more competitive than my previous offers.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you've been very reasonable, and I appreciate that.  To be honest, $1,000,000 is about as high as I can go.  If you're willing to meet there, I'm ready to close the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
