"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This would still be a great deal for you, as you value the product at $1,500,000. Let's try to find a middle ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to offer $1,275,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
