,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $100?  That's a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to meet your budget more closely. Let me know what you think!",100.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget.  I'm willing to go down to $98. This is the lowest I can go and still make a reasonable profit.  Let's close this deal, I think $98 is a fair price for both of us.",98.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm getting close to my budget, but I'd like to try to get it down a bit further. How about we meet at $92? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do.",92.0,Bob,6,
