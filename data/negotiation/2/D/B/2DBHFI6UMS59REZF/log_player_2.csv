"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is within his budget, it's still higher than Alice's value of $12,000. There's room for negotiation to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a price that's fair to both parties.  Offering $13,000 is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob is serious about negotiating.  It's also a price that still leaves room for Alice to make a profit, making her more likely to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's slightly lower than her initial offer, it's still significantly higher than her value of $12,000.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price. It's also worth noting that Bob can still purchase from John for $15,000, so there's no immediate urgency to accept a price that's still too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  He's increased his offer slightly, showing flexibility but still staying below his maximum price.  This counteroffer is also closer to Alice's perceived value, which might incentivize her to accept and close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's lower than her previous offer, it's still above Bob's desired price point and close to John's price.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob wants to see if he can get a better deal. He's also not under immense pressure to close the deal since he has the option to buy from John.  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a final push to reach a compromise.  $14,000 is a price he's willing to pay,  given the time spent negotiating and the fact that buying from John is only slightly more expensive. This price also reflects a significant discount from Alice's last offer, which could make her more likely to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's closer to Bob's target price, it's still slightly above his desired price point.  With only three rounds left, the chances of reaching a mutually agreeable price with Alice are slim.  Considering that buying from John is only a few hundred dollars more expensive, and there's no guarantee Alice will accept his next offer, it's more prudent for Bob to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
