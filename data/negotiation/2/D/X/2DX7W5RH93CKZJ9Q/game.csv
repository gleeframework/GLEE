"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is impressive, the price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for getting back to me. I appreciate the offer but $1,000,000 is still a little too high for my budget.  I could potentially go up to $750,000. Let me know if that works for you.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $750,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $900,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,5,
