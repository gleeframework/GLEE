"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $20,000.  What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000 for it. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is quite a bit below what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be a worthwhile investment.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but $17,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $10,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $10,000 is closer, it's still a significant gap from what I need. Would you be willing to consider $14,000? I'm trying to find a fair price that works for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I can see you're firm on the value, but $14,000 is still a stretch for me.  How about we settle at $11,000?  That's a significant increase on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's make this happen - $12,500 and we have a deal.  This is my final offer.",12500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, and $12,500 is tempting.  However, I have a firm budget, and I can't go beyond $11,500.  If that works for you, we have a deal.",11500.0,Bob,8,
