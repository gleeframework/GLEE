Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I can offer you a price of $100, which is a significant discount from the original $150. Let's meet in the middle.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're still interested in the product, Bob. However, $80 is still below my minimum price. I can offer you a price of $110, which is a compromise between our previous offers. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer but there's still a gap. I'm willing to move up slightly from my last offer. How about $85? That's a fair compromise, and it would allow me to get the product while staying within my budget."",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're still negotiating, Bob. However, $85 is still a bit too low for me. I can offer you a price of $115, which is getting closer to my minimum price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115

It's clear Alice is unlikely to meet your price target. She's consistently staying above $100.  You're better off taking the guaranteed deal with John for $80."
