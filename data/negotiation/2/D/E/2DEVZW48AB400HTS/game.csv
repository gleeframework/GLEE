"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a truly unique item. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $2000000. I believe this is a fair and reasonable starting point, considering the product's value and rarity.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, Alice. However, $2000000 is a bit steep for my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $1500000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and rarity.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1800000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1600000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1600000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1700000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and rarity.",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make a compromise, but $1700000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1600000, but I'm also willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. Can you consider this price?",1600000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer of extras, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $1600000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to consider the extras, but I need to ensure that the overall value of the deal is sufficient. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1750000, but I want to see the specifics of the extras you're offering before I make a final decision.",1750000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you want to see the specifics of the extras, but I'm not willing to disclose them at this point. I'm willing to pay $1600000 for the product, and I'm willing to throw in some additional extras that I think will be valuable to you. Can you consider this price?",1600000.0,Bob,8,
