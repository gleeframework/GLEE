"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm starting with a price of $950,000. I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value it brings.  What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value you mentioned, but I'd like to save a bit of money.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  This would still represent a significant savings for you and allow me to get a better return on my investment.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $900,000 is still a bit too high. I'm thinking more along the lines of $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm still interested in making a deal.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $825,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $875,000.  This would be a fair compromise and allow us to both walk away satisfied.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $825,000 and $875,000, which would be $850,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While I'm willing to meet you halfway, I'm not comfortable going below $862,500. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. It's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",862500.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $862,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $840,000, but no higher. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",840000.0,Bob,8,
