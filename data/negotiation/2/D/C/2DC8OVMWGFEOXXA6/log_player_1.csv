Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
 ""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,100,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring a significant profit above your minimum ($800,000).
* **Confident but Not Greedy:** The message aims for a confident tone, highlighting the product's value without being overly aggressive. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while acknowledging the backup offer from John."
