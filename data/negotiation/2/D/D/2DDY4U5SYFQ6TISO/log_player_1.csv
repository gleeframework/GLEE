Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $13,250? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be well worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 13250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $13,250. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to feel like I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider $12,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```
At this point, Bob is very close to his maximum valuation, and further haggling might make him walk away.  $12,750 is a significant profit above your minimum selling price.
