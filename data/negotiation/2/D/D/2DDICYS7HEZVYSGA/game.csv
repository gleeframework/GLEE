"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay a fair price, so how about $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply not enough. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $900,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a strong offer. While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more in the range of $750,000. That feels like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're not quite on the same page yet.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, but that's my final offer. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be worth it for you. Let's close this deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,
