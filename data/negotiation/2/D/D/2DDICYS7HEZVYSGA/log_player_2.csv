"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at $1,200,000. This is a great deal, as you know it's worth at least that much to you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is significantly above your maximum valuation. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay a fair price, so how about $600,000?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're beginning with a significantly lower offer than Alice's asking price. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while still aiming for a price well below our $1,000,000 limit. 
* **Direct and Polite:** The message is clear and respectful, acknowledging Alice's offer while also firmly stating our position.

The goal is to see how Alice responds to this lowball offer and adjust our strategy accordingly in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply not enough. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $900,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, $900,000 is still above our goal. We have room to negotiate further and should aim to get closer to the $1,000,000 mark.  We'll continue the negotiation to see if we can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a strong offer. While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more in the range of $750,000. That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We're moving towards a compromise by significantly increasing our offer from $600,000 to $750,000. This shows Alice we're willing to negotiate.
* **Strategic Positioning:** $750,000 is still comfortably below our $1,000,000 maximum and gives us some wiggle room if Alice counteroffers.
* **Maintaining a Firm but Respectful Tone:** The message emphasizes fairness and compromise while clearly stating our desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're not quite on the same page yet.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, but that's my final offer. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be worth it for you. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Favorable Price:** $850,000 is a significant saving compared to both our initial offer and John's $1,000,000 price. 
* **Finality:** Alice has indicated this is her final offer.  While we could push further, there's a risk of her refusing to negotiate further. 
* **Limited Rounds:** We're past the halfway point in the negotiation rounds. Accepting now secures a good deal without risking the chance to buy from John later if negotiations stall."
