"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget. I'm thinking more in the range of $600,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's the best I can do. Let me know if you're interested.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I can see the value in your product, but I have to stick to my budget.  Would you consider $700,000? That's a significant offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 still isn't close enough. I'm willing to go down to $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and it gives you a great value for this unique product.  Let me know if you're ready to close the deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. While $775,000 is closer to my expectations, I'm still firm on getting at least $825,000 for this product. This is a reasonable compromise, and it's my final offer.  Let me know if you're ready to close this deal.",825000.0,Alice,7,
