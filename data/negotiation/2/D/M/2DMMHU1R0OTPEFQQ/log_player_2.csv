"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with an opportunity to acquire our premium product, which holds significant value for you at $15,000. I am offering this exceptional item to you at a special price of $12,000. This is a unique chance to secure a high-quality product at a favorable rate. Please let me know if you're interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While $12,000 is a decent price and below your maximum, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to get a better price from her, closer to her $10,000 valuation. You can always fall back on buying from John for $15,000 if needed."
