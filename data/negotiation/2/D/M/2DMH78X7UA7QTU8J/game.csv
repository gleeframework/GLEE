"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. I think this is a fair price considering its value and the benefits it offers.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $20,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise for both of us.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $17,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $15,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value and benefits it offers.",15000.0,Bob,4,
