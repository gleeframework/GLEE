"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high price to see if Bob is serious about buying the product.  If he rejects, we can negotiate. I'm also mindful of the 10-round limit and the potential sale to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is a decent price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob, given that I'm confident the product is worth more than that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still aiming for a profit. It's a reasonable compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also indicates the product is worth more than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has increased his offer to $1,100,000, which is closer to my desired price. I'm satisfied with this offer, especially considering the time constraint and the option to sell to John for $1,000,000. It's better to secure a deal now rather than risk losing a sale and ending up with a lower price later."
