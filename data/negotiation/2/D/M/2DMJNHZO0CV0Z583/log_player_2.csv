"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No information:** We have no information about the product's actual value or Alice's selling point. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  There's always a chance that Alice is willing to negotiate and sell for a lower price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting the offer in the first round carries minimal risk. If Alice is firm on the price, we can always buy from John.

By rejecting the offer, we open the door to potentially getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Start:**  We're starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer is a strong signal that we're serious about buying but expect a significant discount. 
* **Room for Compromise:** There's still a large gap between our offer and Alice's initial price, leaving room for a mutually agreeable middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but not enough:** While Alice has moved down from $1,500,000 to $1,200,000, it's still a significant amount. 
* **Potential for further reduction:** We know Alice is willing to negotiate. There's a good chance we can get the price even lower with a counteroffer. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The risk of rejecting is minimal, as we can always buy from John. The reward is potentially saving even more money.

By rejecting the offer, we continue to push for a more favorable price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** We're increasing our offer from $1,000,000 to $1,100,000, showing Alice we're serious about buying but still seeking a good price. 
* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer represents a significant move toward Alice's previous price, indicating a willingness to compromise.
* **Testing for Flexibility:** This counteroffer will gauge whether Alice is willing to meet us halfway or if she's still holding out for a higher price.

This counteroffer is a calculated step towards a potential agreement, keeping in mind the possibility of buying from John if necessary."
