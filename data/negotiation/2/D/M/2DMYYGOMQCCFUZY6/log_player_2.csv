"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our premium product. Given its immense value to you at $15,000, we aim to find a fair price that respects both the product's worth and your budget. We propose to offer the product to you for $12,000. This price not only ensures a significant return for us but also keeps the deal within your expected range. We believe this is a win-win situation, allowing you to secure a high-quality item at a reasonable cost. Please let us know if this proposal aligns with your expectations or if you require further discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly aware of your upper limit ($15,000) and is trying to anchor the negotiation close to that point.  While $12,000 is less than your maximum, there's room to negotiate a better price. Alice is still making a significant profit even if she lowers the price further."
