 ""product_price"": 6000
}
```

This is an aggressive opening counter-offer, designed to move the negotiation closer to my desired price range. It's important to remain polite and professional while still clearly stating my position."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of offering you the product for $9,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  However,  $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you consider $7,000? I believe this price point reflects a mutually beneficial agreement."",
 ""product_price"": 7000
}
```

This counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation moving while inching closer to my ideal price.  I acknowledge Alice's compromise and offer a price that is a fair jump from my previous offer while remaining under my $8,000 limit."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to get for the product. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is very close to my limit, but I know John will sell it for $8,000.  It's worth one more counter-offer to see if I can get closer to John's price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, you're very close, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  Could you do $7,500? I'm ready to close the deal today at that price."",

}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad to hear that you're close to making a decision. I'm willing to meet you at $7,800. This is the highest price I'm willing to go, considering the value the product brings to your business. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm eager to finalize the deal.
