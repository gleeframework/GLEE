"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers.

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I believe your initial asking price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $1,100,000.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price. I could consider letting it go for $1,350,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? ",1225000.0,Bob,4,
