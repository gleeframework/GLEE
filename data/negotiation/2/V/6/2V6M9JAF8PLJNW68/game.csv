"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of immense value to you. It's worth at least $1500000 to you, and I'm confident you'll see its potential. I'm offering it to you for $1250000. This is a fair price considering its true worth.  Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I'm not sure if the product is worth that much to me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1100000. I'm willing to take a chance on the product, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest. While $1100000 is a good starting point, I'm still confident that this product holds significant value for you, well beyond that figure. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1150000. This price reflects a compromise on my end and allows for a substantial profit for both of us. Consider this my final offer before I explore other options.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1150000 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1050000. I'm willing to take a risk on the product, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
