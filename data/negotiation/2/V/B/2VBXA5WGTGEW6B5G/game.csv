"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price that allows you a decent profit while still saving me a significant amount. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must respectfully decline your offer of $9,500. Based on the value of the product and the expenses involved, I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. I would like to propose $10,500 for the product. This price reflects the quality and value it offers while ensuring a reasonable profit for me. I look forward to your consideration of this proposal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,750. This price is fair to both of us and avoids the need for further negotiation.  Let's make a deal.",9750.0,Bob,4,
