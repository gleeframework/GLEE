"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to me ($800,000 vs. $1,200,000).  I have 10 rounds to negotiate, so I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which I think is a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant amount, but I still think the product is worth more to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming up a bit, but I still think I can get a better price. I'm going to reject her offer and try to push for something closer to my initial counteroffer of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us. Let's try to find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 975000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I still think the product is worth more to me than $975,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $925,000. This is a fair price that takes into account your willingness to compromise, and I believe it's a good middle ground for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is again coming down, but it's only a small amount.  I still want to push for a price closer to $1,000,000. It's possible I can get there in the next few rounds.  I'm also starting to consider the risk of running out of time and being forced to buy from John at $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $925,000 is still a little too far from what I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer you $960,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us, and it gets us closer to an agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 960000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I still think the product is worth more to me than $960,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to what I want, we're running out of time.  I'm going to make one more counteroffer, but if Alice rejects it, I might have to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close, but $915,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer you $940,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I might have to explore other options.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 940000}

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I still think the product is worth more to me than $940,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the last round, and Alice's offer is still not ideal. While I could make one more counteroffer, there's no guarantee Alice will accept, and I risk losing out on the deal entirely. 

Buying from John at $1,200,000 is a sure thing. It's not the best price, but it guarantees I get the product, and I have a good chance of getting a better deal with Alice in the future."
