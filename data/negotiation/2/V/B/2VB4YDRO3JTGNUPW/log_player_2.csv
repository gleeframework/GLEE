"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* You can potentially negotiate a better price with Alice.
* There's always the option to buy from John, so rejecting Alice's offer doesn't mean losing out on the product."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go down to $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,275,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the negotiations we've had so far. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $1,275,000 is within your budget of $1,500,000.
* This is a good compromise, as it's lower than Alice's initial offer but still higher than your initial counteroffer.
* It's unlikely that further negotiation will yield a significantly lower price."
