"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go down to $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,275,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the negotiations we've had so far. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
