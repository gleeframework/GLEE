{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $13,500. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but allows room for negotiation. It's also lower than my minimum acceptable price, leaving space to potentially go higher if Bob counters."
