While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,460,000 makes the most sense at this stage. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** Even at this price, I'm securing a substantial profit margin above my minimum ($1,200,000). 
* **Time Value of Money:** Prolonging the negotiation further risks losing the deal entirely. Closing now ensures I get paid.
* **Uncertainty of Future Offers:** There's no guarantee Bob will offer a better price in subsequent rounds. He might even lower his offer.  

Accepting $1,460,000 guarantees a significant return and avoids the potential risks of continued negotiation."
