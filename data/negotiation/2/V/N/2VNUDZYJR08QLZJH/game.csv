"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to pay that price, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the market value of the product.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16000. It's a fair price considering the value I place on the product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a discounted rate.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $16000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, and I think $14000 is a fair price considering its value. Can you meet me at this price?",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $14000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $15500. It's a compromise that I'm willing to make to get the deal done, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value I place on the product.",15500.0,Alice,5,
