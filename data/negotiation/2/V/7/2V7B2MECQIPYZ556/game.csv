"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
