"Bob, I understand your position. While $850,000 is still a good price for you, it's just a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's close this and move forward.",900000.0,Alice,3,
