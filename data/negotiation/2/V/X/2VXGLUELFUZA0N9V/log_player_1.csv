Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$175:**  This is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to leave some wiggle room to allow for counteroffers.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. It also highlights the product's value.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while also keeping the negotiation open for a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $80 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While it's tempting to take the $80, selling to John for $150 guarantees me a much better outcome.  Therefore, I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to counter-offer him in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125, which I think is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$125:** This counteroffer is significantly higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still ensuring a profit for me. 
* **Message:** The message remains polite and reiterates the product's value to justify the price. It also encourages Bob to consider the offer by acknowledging his interest. 

This approach aims to continue the negotiation process while ensuring I remain within my acceptable price range and avoid settling for a deal that is significantly below my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a good product Alice, but I'm on a tight budget. How about $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has increased his offer slightly, it is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Selling to John for $150 remains the most profitable option. I will reject Bob's offer and continue to negotiate in the hopes of reaching a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$110:** This counteroffer is a compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate further. It's closer to Bob's offer, but still leaves some room for potential profit.
* **Message:** The message remains polite and acknowledges Bob's budget constraints. It emphasizes the value of the product while offering a slightly lower price.

This strategy aims to:

* **Keep the negotiation going:** This allows for the potential of a higher offer from Bob in the future.
* **Remain within my acceptable range:**  $110 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Signal flexibility:** This shows Bob that I'm open to finding a mutually agreeable price."
