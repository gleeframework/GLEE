Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It is significantly higher than John's offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It signals to Bob that you value the product highly, but are also willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. It's worth exploring further negotiation, as his offer still indicates his interest."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate, but not at a price that significantly undervalues the product. It's a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's offer, giving us both some room to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not worth the risk of further negotiation. John's offer guarantees me a safe and acceptable profit, so I'll take it."
