"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm asking for $9,500. I think it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring you.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is still a good price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? That's a significant discount from my initial asking price.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget. Let's try $8,750. This is a fair price that is closer to both of our positions. What do you think?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While $8,750 is closer, I'm aiming for something a bit higher.  Would you consider $8,900?  This feels like a good compromise where we both get a reasonable deal.",8900.0,Alice,5,
