"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. As we discussed, I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $14,000 for the product. This is still a good deal for you, as it's well above your value for it. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $14,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16,500. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,500 is still a bit higher than I'm aiming for. I'm willing to offer $15,000 for the product. This is still a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,4,
