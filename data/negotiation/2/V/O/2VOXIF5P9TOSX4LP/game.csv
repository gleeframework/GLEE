"Bob, I believe this product holds immense value for you, as it does for me. I'm offering it to you for $1600000.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering its worth to both of us. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1400000 doesn't quite reflect the product's true worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1550000. This is a fair price that balances our interests. Let's see if we can reach an agreement here.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
