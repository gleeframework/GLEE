"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $150 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $125. Is that something you'd be interested in?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $125 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to do $115? This is my final offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at this price.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to meet you at $120, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're still interested, I can make it a one-time deal at this price.",120.0,Alice,5,
