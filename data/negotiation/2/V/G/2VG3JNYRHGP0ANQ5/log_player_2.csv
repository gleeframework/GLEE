"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really appreciate. It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $115.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $115 is below your maximum budget, you can likely get a better price. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. You can then proceed to negotiate with Alice or go with your backup option of buying from John for $120."
