Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

Since Bob values the product at $1,500,000, offering it at that price guarantees a sale.  It's the best possible outcome for me, as I can't get a higher price and still ensure a sale.  If he rejects, I can still sell to John for the same price, but it's always better to get a deal done sooner rather than later."
