"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us. It's significantly lower than what it's worth to me, but I believe it's a fair price for the value it holds for you.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value it holds for me.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While your offer is lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? This would still allow you to make a significant profit, and I would be able to move this product quickly.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Alice,3,
