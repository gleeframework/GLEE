Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your lowest acceptable price (reservation price).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.  He won't pay more than this.
* **Potential Profit:**  There's a potential profit margin between Bob's value and your minimum.

**The Strategy**

You want to offer Bob a price that is:

* **Attractive enough for him to accept.** It needs to be below his $1,200,000 valuation.
* **High enough to maximize your profit.**  Get as close to $1,200,000 as possible.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen.  I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  This offer reflects my desire to establish a mutually beneficial partnership."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** It's framed positively, emphasizing value and partnership.
* **The Price:**  $1,150,000 is a strong starting point. It gives Bob a $50,000 discount (making it enticing), while still securing you a substantial profit above your minimum. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation is fluid:** Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to negotiate, but don't go below your $1,500,000 minimum. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having John as a backup gives you a strong position, but don't reveal this to Bob."
