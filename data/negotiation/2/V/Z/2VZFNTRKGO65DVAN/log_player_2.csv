"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,000,000. It's a fair deal, as the product is worth exactly that amount to you.  I know you're a serious buyer, and I believe this is an excellent opportunity for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, and John is also willing to sell it for that price, there's no benefit in accepting Alice's offer. Bob can save money by buying from John."
