"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a good deal, it's still above your target of saving as much money as possible. It's worth seeing if you can get an even lower price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $9,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I believe this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hopeful that Alice will be willing to accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to my ideal price, but I'm still aiming for a lower price. I'm confident that I can get closer to my target with further negotiation. I'm not ready to buy from John yet, as there's still potential for a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9200}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate. I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing I'm serious about buying but still pushing for a lower price. This should hopefully incentivize Alice to come closer to my target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is gradually increasing her offer, but it's getting close to my target price. Accepting her offer at $9,800 will save me $2,200 compared to buying from John. While I could potentially push for a lower price, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John for a higher price outweighs the potential savings."
