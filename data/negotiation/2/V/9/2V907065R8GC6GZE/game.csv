"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'd be happy to consider purchasing it for $850,000. This price is fair for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and leaving you with a significant profit.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $850,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and consider a price of $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that I believe will be beneficial for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This offer reflects a significant compromise on my part and is a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a way to make this work.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, $950,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that I believe will be acceptable to both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,100,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway on this one and offer $1,000,000. This price is a reasonable compromise that should be acceptable for both of us, allowing us to close this deal.  Let's make this happen!",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of a price of $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that I believe will be acceptable to both of us, and it's my final offer. After this, I'll have to consider other options.",1150000.0,Alice,7,
