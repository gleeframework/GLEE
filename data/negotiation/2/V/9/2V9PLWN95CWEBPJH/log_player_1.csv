Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This is a good starting point because it's a price that's still attractive to Bob, considering he values it at $150, but also gives me a decent profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $130 is better than selling to John, it's still not as good as my initial offer. I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm offering a price of $135. This is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.  It's still a good deal for me and might be tempting enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While $132 isn't ideal, it's still a good profit and better than selling to John for $120.  There's a chance I could continue negotiating and get a bit more, but the risk of losing the deal entirely outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price."
