"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Beginning with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) allows room for negotiation and signals the product's worth in your eyes. 
* **Anchoring:** This high initial price sets an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind. Even though it's likely to be rejected, it influences his perception of the product's value and can lead to a more favorable counteroffer.
* **Leaving Room for Concessions:** By starting high, you have room to make concessions throughout the negotiation, which can make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while keeping the door open for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me right now. I'd be willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). You have room to negotiate and try to bring him closer to your target. Selling to John is a guaranteed profit but leaves potential money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you see value in the product, but $1,200,000 is too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000 to find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** Dropping $300,000 demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, but it's crucial to stay well above both your minimum and Bob's initial offer.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  While moving closer to Bob's range, the message emphasizes this is a significant concession and that you're serious about reaching a fair deal, not just making any deal.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer gauges Bob's flexibility.  Will he significantly increase his offer, or are we in for a long back-and-forth? This information will guide your strategy in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $2,000,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. Would you consider $1,400,000? I believe that's a fair offer reflecting the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While you could potentially negotiate for more, accepting this offer guarantees a significant profit without the risk of Bob walking away or further extended negotiations."
