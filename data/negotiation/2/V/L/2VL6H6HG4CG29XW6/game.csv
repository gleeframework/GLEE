"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $950,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also giving me a fair return on my investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $800,000, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
