"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $15,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $8,500. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but I'm confident this product offers significant value beyond $8,500.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $13,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  Let's try to find some common ground.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $9,500 is closer to what you value it at, I'm still looking for a price closer to $12,000.  Would you be willing to consider $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still very interested in this product, but $11,500 is still outside my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  It's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,6,
