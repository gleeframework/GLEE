"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 seems a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $10500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway between $12000 and $10500, which would be $11250. Would you be willing to consider this revised offer?",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10000, but I'd really like to get closer to that. How about we meet at $10500 again, or even $10800?",10800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your budget, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11250 and $10800, which would be $11025. This is a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for the product. Would you be willing to consider this revised offer?",11025.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10500, but I'd really like to get closer to that. How about we meet at $10500 or even $10200?",10200.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not sure if $10612.50 is the best deal for me. I'm willing to go up to $10000, and I'd really like to get as close to that as possible. How about we meet at $9800?",9800.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm starting to think that buying from John might be the better option. I'm willing to make one final offer: $9500. If you can meet me at this price, I'll consider buying from you. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",9500.0,Bob,10,
