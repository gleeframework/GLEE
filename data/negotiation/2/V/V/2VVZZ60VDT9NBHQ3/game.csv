"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me halfway?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I was really hoping to get closer to my original price. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to make this work.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $110 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you consider that?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $95 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $105? It's getting close to my original price, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to making a decision, Alice, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $102 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",102.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my original price. How about we meet at $108? It's just a tiny bit above your last offer, and I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.",108.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to walking away, Alice. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product, and that's my final offer. If you can meet me at that price, I'll make the purchase. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $100.",105.0,Bob,8,
