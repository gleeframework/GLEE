Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm willing to make a deal.  I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for a price close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially still landing within a very profitable range for Alice.
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning other buyers and a ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to act quickly and not risk losing the deal.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 provides a safety net, ensuring Alice doesn't settle for less than her minimum."
