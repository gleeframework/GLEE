"Thanks for letting me know your budget, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a bit tight for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be open to considering a price of $13500?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, based on my budget constraints, I am unable to agree to $13500. Could we perhaps aim for a price closer to $10000?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10000 and $15000, which would be $12500. Would you be willing to consider that price?",12500.0,Alice,5,
