Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This starting offer aims high while still being within a potentially believable range for Bob. Here's why:

* **Anchoring:** Starting high sets an ""anchor"" price in Bob's mind. Even if he rejects the initial offer, his counteroffer might be higher than if we started lower.
* **Room to Negotiate:**  The $150 offer leaves plenty of room for negotiation. We can gradually lower the price to entice Bob while staying above our minimum.
* **Preserving John:** We always have the fallback option of selling to John for $100, so there's no pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm a bit of a bargain hunter and I'm trying to stay within a budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is too low. We have a lot of room to negotiate before considering that price.  We'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to our minimum but still leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $80 is quite a bit lower than I can go. How about we meet in the middle at $120?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Significant Decrease:**  We've dropped our price by $30, which shows Bob we're willing to negotiate.
* **Above Minimum:** We're still well above our $100 minimum and Bob's $80 offer.
* **Compromise Framing:** By suggesting we ""meet in the middle,"" we encourage Bob to feel like he's getting a concession and participating in a fair negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $90? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is getting closer to our minimum, we're still in a position to negotiate a bit further. Bob is clearly interested and willing to bargain. We'll reject this offer and try to nudge him closer to the $100 mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""You drive a hard bargain, Bob! I can do $100 for it, but that's my absolute best price."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob Halfway:**  We're splitting the difference between his $90 offer and our previous $110 price, showing flexibility.
* **Final Offer:** The ""absolute best price"" language signals to Bob that this is our final offer, and we're unlikely to go lower.
* **John as Backup:** We're now at our minimum acceptable price. If Bob rejects this, we're content to walk away and sell to John for the same amount."
