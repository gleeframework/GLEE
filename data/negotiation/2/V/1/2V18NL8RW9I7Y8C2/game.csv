"I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $950000, which I think is a fair reflection of its value.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $950000 is higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $750000, reflecting a fair market value for this product. ",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $850000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle again, and offer $800000 for the product.  This is my final offer, and it's fair for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'll offer the product to you for $825000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,
