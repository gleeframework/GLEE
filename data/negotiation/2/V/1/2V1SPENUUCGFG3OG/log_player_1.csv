"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum threshold of $150. I'll try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet halfway."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd be willing to pay $110 for the product. Can you meet me halfway again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're both trying to find a fair price.  I'm willing to come down to $115.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd be willing to pay $105 for the product. Can you meet me halfway again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price of $150. There are only a few rounds left, and I'm not confident I can get a significantly better offer from Bob. I'd rather sell the product to John and secure my desired price."
