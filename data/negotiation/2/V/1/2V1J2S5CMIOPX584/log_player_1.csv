Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, making this your lowest acceptable price (your ""reservation value"").
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's a potential negotiation space between $800,000 and $1,200,000.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, but offering a price too close to $1,200,000 increases the risk of Bob rejecting the deal. A good strategy is to aim for a price that gives you a significant profit while still leaving Bob with a sense of gain.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,050,000 is fair for both of us. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You're starting the negotiation by highlighting the product's value and exclusivity.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,050,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still leaving Bob with a $150,000 gain compared to his valuation.
* **Time Pressure:**  By mentioning other interested parties (even if John is your only alternative), you create a sense of urgency.

**Important Note:** Negotiation is dynamic. Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on his response."
