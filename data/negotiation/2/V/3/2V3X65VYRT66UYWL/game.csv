"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a higher price, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,075,000 is still too low.  Would you consider $1,090,000? This represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the true value of the product.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,090,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,080,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can meet on this price.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
