Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a higher price, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $1,075,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob is clearly interested. We have room to negotiate and try to get closer to $1,100,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,075,000 is still too low.  Would you consider $1,090,000? This represents a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the true value of the product."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your concession, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,090,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,080,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can meet on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we'd ideally like to get closer to $1,100,000, Bob has become firmer in his offers. Accepting $1,080,000 secures a substantial profit above John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in further rounds."
