"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, and she's offering it at $1,100,000. That's still too high for Bob, who's only willing to pay up to $800,000. It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,100,000 is above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $850,000 at this time. This is my best offer, considering my maximum price point. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However,  $850,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. To move this forward, I can come down to $1,000,000. This is a firm offer, as I already have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is still too high.  While we are getting closer to a workable price, it's still too early to accept, especially with other parties interested. Let's try another counteroffer to see if we can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you have other offers, but $1,000,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm genuinely interested and willing to work with you, but I can only go up to $900,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value we've discussed.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I'm willing to make one final concession.  My final offer is $950,000. This reflects a significant reduction on my part and is non-negotiable.  It's important for you to understand that I have a firm offer from another buyer at a higher price, but I'm giving you this opportunity due to our conversations. Please consider carefully. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is still too high, but this is a tough one. She is clearly at her limit, and we are getting closer.  However, we still have a little room to negotiate. If this is her final offer, we should still try to push her down a bit before taking the offer or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your final offer and willingness to compromise. However, $950,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford at this time. Would you be willing to come down to $925,000? This would allow us to close the deal and still be a fair price for both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we're both willing to be flexible."", ""product_price"": 925000}
