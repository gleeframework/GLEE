"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to start with a price of $800000. I'm confident you'll see the value it brings and be willing to pay a premium, but I'm open to negotiating.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. $800000 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. I'm willing to pay $700000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save a bit, but I believe the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for its worth. I'm willing to offer it to you for $750000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $750000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $725000. It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to move forward with the purchase if we can agree.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $725000, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'm willing to go up to $725500, but that's as high as I can go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to move forward with the sale.",725500.0,Alice,5,
