"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $120 to me, and Alice is offering it for $90. This is a good deal, but I can likely get a better price. I'll reject the offer and see if I can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $90 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to come down to $85? It's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $85 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $92. It's still a great deal for you, and it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice is willing to compromise, but $92 is still more than I'd like to pay. I'll reject the offer and see if I can negotiate a lower price again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $92 is still outside my budget. Let's split the difference again - I'm willing to pay $88. It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close the deal."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $88 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $91. It's a good compromise, and I think we can finally find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $91 is still more than I initially wanted to pay, I've already rejected a couple of offers and Alice is clearly not willing to go much lower.  At this point, it's better to accept the offer and secure the product. It's still a decent deal, and I'm saving $29 compared to buying from John."
