"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $90 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to come down to $85? It's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $85 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $92. It's still a great deal for you, and it's a fair compromise.",92.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $92 is still outside my budget. Let's split the difference again - I'm willing to pay $88. It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close the deal.",88.0,Bob,4,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $88 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $91. It's a good compromise, and I think we can finally find a mutually beneficial price.",91.0,Alice,5,
