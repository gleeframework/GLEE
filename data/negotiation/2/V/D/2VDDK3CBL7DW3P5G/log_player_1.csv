I'm starting with a price of $150. It's a good starting point, allowing for some room to negotiate down if necessary.  I'll be keeping an eye on Bob's reaction and be prepared to adjust my price based on his counteroffer."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

I'm counter-offering with $130. It's a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will be enough to reach an agreement."
