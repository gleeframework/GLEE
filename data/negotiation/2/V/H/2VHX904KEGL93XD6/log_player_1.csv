Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,450,000, which is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** This allows for potential counteroffers without immediately hitting my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive Language:**  The message emphasizes a ""great deal"" and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I'm aware of John's offer, so I'm not desperate to close with Bob. This allows me to be more assertive in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product to you, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,200,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,350,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While $1,350,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I would ideally like to get. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  I'm confident I can push for a higher price. Even if I have to make a counteroffer, I'm still in a strong position since John is willing to pay my desired price.
* **Negotiation is Key:**  Rejecting this offer signals that I'm not desperate and am willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value our discussion, I'm unable to accept $1,350,000.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,400,000.  This price reflects the product's true value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but Maintain Leverage:**  I'm counteroffering at $1,400,000, which is a compromise but still above my minimum. This shows flexibility while maintaining some bargaining power.
* **Positive Tone:** The message focuses on collaboration and emphasizes the mutual benefits of the deal. 
* **Fairness and Value:** I reiterate that the price reflects the product's true value, reinforcing the justification for my counteroffer.
* **Urgency Implied:** While not directly stated, the message subtly implies that I'm willing to negotiate but not at any cost, subtly encouraging Bob to take the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I still aim to keep my expenses within $1,200,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I believe this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a Stalemate:**  Bob's counteroffer of $1,300,000 is getting very close to his initial offer, and it's unlikely that further negotiation will yield a significantly higher price.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could continue to negotiate, the risk of further delays and the potential for Bob to walk away entirely outweighs the possible gain of a few hundred thousand dollars.
* **Guaranteed Outcome:** Selling to John guarantees my minimum desired price of $1,500,000, ensuring a satisfactory outcome.  It's a safer and more reliable strategy than continuing the negotiation with Bob."
