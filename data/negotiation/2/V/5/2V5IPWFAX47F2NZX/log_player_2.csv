"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive deal on this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. It's a steal, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is the best option. Here's why:

* **Alice's Offer:** $130
* **Your Maximum:** $150
* **John's Price:** $150

While you could reject Alice's offer hoping for a lower price, there's no guarantee she'll come down further. You'd also risk losing the product entirely. Accepting her offer saves you $20 compared to buying from John."
