Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a better price, but I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **You're close to Alice's bottom line:** She's signaled that $10,500 is her lowest acceptable price. Pushing further might irritate her and risk the deal.
* **Significant savings:** You're getting the product for $4,500 less than John's price. 
* **Time is a factor:** You've already used half your rounds. While you could try to haggle further, you risk Alice becoming firmer in her position.

It's generally better to secure a good deal than risk losing it for a potentially small gain."
