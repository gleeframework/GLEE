"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $750000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $825000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider $775000?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still a bit short on budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $820000. This is my best offer, but I'm open to discussing further if you're willing to meet me at this price.",820000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still trying to stretch your budget, Bob. However, I've already made a significant concession by offering it at $820000. I'm willing to make one more move, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $815000. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",815000.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not sure I'm willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you at $810000, but I need to make it clear that this is my absolute final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll need to consider other options.",810000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable with $810000. I'm willing to meet you at $795000, and if that's not acceptable, I'll need to explore other options, including buying from John for $1200000. Is $795000 a price you're willing to accept?",795000.0,Bob,10,
