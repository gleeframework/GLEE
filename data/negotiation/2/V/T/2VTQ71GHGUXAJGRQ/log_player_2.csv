"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $12,000. I believe it will be highly valuable for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above Bob's budget of $8,000. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but still leaves some room for negotiation. Bob is starting at the maximum he's willing to pay, but it's reasonable given his budget and the product's value to him."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand your position, but the product is worth a lot to me. How about we settle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's first offer, it's still above his maximum. It's worth trying to negotiate further, as Bob is still saving money by going through this process compared to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a little out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, and that's my absolute limit. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is staying firm with his budget but showing willingness to compromise.  He's gone up from his initial offer, demonstrating good faith, but  he's still significantly below Alice's price, leaving room for her to make a final concession."
