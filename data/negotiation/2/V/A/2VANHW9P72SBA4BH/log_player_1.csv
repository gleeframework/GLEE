{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $15,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial high price will be telling. If he's immediately turned off, you know you might need to come down significantly. If he counters, it indicates he's seriously interested. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 with John, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
