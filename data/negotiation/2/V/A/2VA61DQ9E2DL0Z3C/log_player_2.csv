"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it would be worth the same to you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message emphasizes the product's value, her offer is her starting point. There's no reason to accept the full price immediately. By rejecting her offer, you open the possibility of a counter-offer from Alice at a lower price. You haven't lost anything because you can always buy from John at the same price if needed."
