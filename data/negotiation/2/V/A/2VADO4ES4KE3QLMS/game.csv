"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7500. Can you consider that?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not there yet.  $7500 is significantly lower than my minimum price. How about we split the difference and meet at $8500?  I think this is a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $8500. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7200. Can you consider that?",7200.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7200 is just too low for me. Let's try to find a middle ground again. I'm willing to come down to $8000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
