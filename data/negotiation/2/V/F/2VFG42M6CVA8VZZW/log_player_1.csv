Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits to you. "", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, my goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,300,000 creates a significant profit margin for me while still being potentially attractive to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is a strong initial offer, the message leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob counters. 
 
**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this offer, I will sell to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
