"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $15,000 is more than Bob is willing to pay, and he has a better option with John."

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible. He knows the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, and he's willing to pay up to that amount. Offering $11,000 is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation but still significantly lower than Alice's initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $13,500 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. He can still get the product from John for $12,000, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway. He's increased his offer from $11,000 to $12,500, which is still a good deal for both parties. Alice is getting a better price than her previous offer, and Bob is still saving money compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob has been steadily increasing his offer, but Alice has been stubbornly resistant. At this point, Alice's offer of $13,000 is still too high for Bob. He's already very close to his maximum price with John, so it makes sense to go with the sure thing and buy from John.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice will lead to a better price, and Bob doesn't want to risk losing the product entirely."
