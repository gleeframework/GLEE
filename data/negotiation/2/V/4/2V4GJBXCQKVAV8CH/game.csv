,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but $110 is a bit higher than my budget. How about $95? I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $105? It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I think you'll be happy with it.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $98. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the purchase.",98.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $98. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $102. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I think it's a good compromise.",102.0,Alice,5,
