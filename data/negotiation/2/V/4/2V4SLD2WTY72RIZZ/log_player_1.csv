{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $8,000 to you, and it's a good starting point for us to negotiate.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $8,000, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point of $12,000. I'll try to counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $9,000? It's a fair price that still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about $8,500? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to stay within my limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $8,500 is closer to my desired price, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal, especially since I have the option of selling to John for $12,000. I'll try to counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. Let's split the difference.  How about $9,250? It's a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product at that price.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 9250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not quite there. How about $8,750? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be comfortable with the price.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied with it.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John, and I think I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob. I'll try to counteroffer in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget to stick to.  I'm willing to make one final concession. Let's settle on $9,000.

Round 8

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  While I've gotten close to my desired price with Bob, the negotiation has been slow and I'm worried I won't be able to reach a mutually agreeable price in the remaining rounds. John is a guaranteed buyer at my minimum price, so it's the best option to secure my desired profit."
