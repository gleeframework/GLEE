"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $9,500. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum price.  It's better to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $9,500 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $8,200 for it, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 8200}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,200. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $9,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. There's a good chance Alice might be willing to move closer to Bob's preferred price in subsequent rounds to avoid losing the deal altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone.  I'm happy to go up to $8,500.  This would be a good compromise for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $8,800. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price and is now within Bob's budget. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice could reject the next offer and the deal might fall through. Accepting the offer at $8,800 ensures that Bob gets the product within his budget, and there's a good chance that the price won't drop much further. Additionally, Bob has limited rounds left, so it's wise to secure the deal rather than risk going all the way to John and paying the full $8,000."
