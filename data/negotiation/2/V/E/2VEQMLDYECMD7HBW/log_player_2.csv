**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $10,000. There's room for negotiation, and you might be able to get a better price by making a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering your budget and the value you place on the product, I am willing to negotiate further. I propose a price of $9,800 for the product.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,800 is still above your maximum budget of $10,000. While it's closer, there's still room for negotiation, and you might be able to get a better price by making a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I appreciate your patience and understanding in this matter. After careful consideration, I am willing to accept $10,000 for the product, which aligns closely with your budget. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has finally come down to your maximum budget of $10,000. This is a good deal for you, as it allows you to acquire the product without exceeding your budget. While you could technically buy from John for the same price, there's no reason to do so when you've successfully negotiated with Alice."
