Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value to me. However, $17000 is a bit too steep. I'm willing to pay $14500. Let's see if we can find common ground.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $14,500, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I want to see if I can negotiate a bit higher."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $16000, but I'm still aiming for a lower price. I'm willing to pay $15500. This is a fair price that would allow both of us to walk away happy. Let's make a deal.
