"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15000 to you. Let's see if we can make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He wants to save money and $17,000 is more than he's willing to pay. He can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value to me. However, $17,000 is a bit too steep. I'm willing to pay $14,500. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $14500 is too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $16000.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $16,000 is a better price than the initial $17,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. He's still willing to pay less than $15,000, and he should use the knowledge that he has a backup option (buying from John) to his advantage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $16,000, but I'm still aiming for a lower price. I'm willing to pay $15,500. This is a fair price that would allow both of us to walk away happy. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 15500}
