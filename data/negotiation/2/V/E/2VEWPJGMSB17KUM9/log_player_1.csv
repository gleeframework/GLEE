Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, but it's still a good starting point considering my minimum value for the product. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

$800,000 is far too low for me.  I'm not willing to accept that. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counteroffer at $1,200,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. It's a compromise, and I hope it will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is still too low. While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not sure if we'll be able to reach an agreement. It's better to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John rather than risk further negotiation with Bob."
