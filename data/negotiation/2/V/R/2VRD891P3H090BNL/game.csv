"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise slightly and offer the product for $1,125,000. This price is still fair considering the value it brings to you, and it allows us both to reach an agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,080,000 simply doesn't meet my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away satisfied. Let's close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm close to walking away, Alice. I'm willing to pay $1,090,000 for the product. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John.",1090000.0,Bob,6,
