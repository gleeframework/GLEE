Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Target:** My goal is to maximize profit, so I want to get as close to my minimum value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Initial Offer:** I'm starting with an offer of $14,500. This is a significant discount from my minimum value, but it's still higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Strategy:** This initial offer is designed to:
    * Gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate.
    *  Leave room for negotiation while still keeping my profit margin high. 

I'm ready to counter-offer if Bob rejects this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum value ($15,000).**  Accepting it would result in a loss for me.
* **Selling to John is the most profitable option currently.**  However, I'm still open to negotiation with Bob. 
* **Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter-offer.** I can try to reach a price closer to my desired value while still maintaining the option of selling to John as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer:** I'm offering $13,500, which is halfway between my initial offer ($14,500) and Bob's offer ($12,500).
* **Reasoning:** This compromise demonstrates flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still protecting my profit margin.
* **Next Steps:** I'm hoping that this counteroffer is attractive enough for Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to further negotiate if necessary.  I'm also aware that selling to John is still an option if Bob rejects my counteroffer."
