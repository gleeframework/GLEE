"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value.  Let's try to find a compromise.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $6,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers at $8,250. This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",8250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we are getting closer. To be fair, how about splitting the difference again and settling at $7,875?",7875.0,Bob,6,
