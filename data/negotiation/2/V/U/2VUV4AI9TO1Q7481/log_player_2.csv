"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant return on your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum budget. It's highly unlikely she's expecting you to accept this, so it's best to counter and start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be interested in purchasing the product for $600,000."", 
""product_price"": 600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $600,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it's a strong opening move. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm serious about purchasing but not willing to overpay.
* **Anchoring:** By presenting a lower number first, I'm attempting to influence the negotiation in my favor. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer will gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your offer is significantly below the product's true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This price reflects the product's unique capabilities and potential return on investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice's offer has come down significantly, it's still considerably more than your $800,000 maximum. It seems there's room for negotiation, and accepting now would mean potentially overpaying."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. However,  $1,400,000 is still more than I had in mind.  Would you consider $700,000? I believe that's a fair offer, given the market value of similar products."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm increasing my offer by $100,000, showing willingness to move closer to a deal. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""market value,"" I'm subtly introducing a potential external factor to support my offer. 
* **Leaving Room:**  There's still a significant gap between my offer and Alice's last price, allowing for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your perspective on the market value.  However, there's a significant gap between our positions, and I need to be realistic about my options.  My final offer is $1,200,000. If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other opportunities. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, and she's unwilling to go any lower.
* **Over Budget:**  Even though Alice has come down significantly, $1,200,000 is still above your $800,000 maximum.
* **Guaranteed Price:** You have a guaranteed offer from John at $800,000. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice when you have a better option available. 

It's time to cut your losses with Alice and secure the product at a price you're comfortable with from John."
