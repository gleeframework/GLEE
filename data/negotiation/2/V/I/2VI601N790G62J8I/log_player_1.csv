Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. This product fits my needs, but I need to be mindful of my spending.  Would you consider a price closer to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm afraid $10,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle on $11,500?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,500. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think about my minimum acceptable price. I can offer it to you for $13,500. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you've been very patient and reasonable, and I respect that you have a bottom line. $13,500 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,000 even? I know it's a bit below what you were hoping for, but it would allow me to make the purchase today.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,500. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 1-year warranty and a complimentary maintenance package, which is a $2,000 value. This way, you'll get an even better deal than you initially thought. I'm sticking to my price of $13,500."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
