Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  You don't actually know how much Bob values the product, so you have to make an educated guess.
* **Targeting Above Bob's Value:** Aiming slightly above Bob's potential $1,000,000 valuation might encourage him to negotiate, potentially landing somewhere above your guaranteed $1,200,000 from John. 
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** Creating a sense of urgency and mentioning other interested parties might push Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Important Note:**  There's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright. However, the potential reward of securing a higher price than John's offer makes this a calculated risk worth taking."
