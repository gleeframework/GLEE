{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer allows for some potential negotiation, but still leaves a comfortable margin for me. I'm willing to go down a bit, but not too much, as I have a backup buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, as I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me. I'm willing to make a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low for me. I'm not willing to settle for that price, especially since I have a backup buyer in John who's willing to pay significantly more.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1,350,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. Can we agree on that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not ideal. I'm willing to continue negotiating but I'm also aware of John's offer, so I won't be pressured to make a quick decision. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can come to a better agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go down to $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise and allows for both of us to walk away happy.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go above $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, as I mentioned before. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying from John for $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is clearly not willing to budge on his offer.  While $1,250,000 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm not willing to risk losing John as a buyer. John is willing to pay my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing that opportunity. I'll take John's offer and move on."
