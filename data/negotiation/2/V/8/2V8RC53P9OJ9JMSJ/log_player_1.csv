{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it presents significant value, though I understand you might need some time to consider. Let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss it further."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but we also want to make the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is firm, the language hints at potential discussion, allowing Bob to feel he has some input.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing we have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 gives us leverage. We're not desperate, so the offer to Bob is a take-it-or-leave-it scenario at this price point. 

By offering the product at $14,500, we aim for a win-win: Bob gets a discount compared to our alternative, and we secure a profit above his perceived value."
