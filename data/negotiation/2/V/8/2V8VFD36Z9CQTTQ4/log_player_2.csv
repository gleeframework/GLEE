"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the details with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $1,200,000 is still too high, and there's room for negotiation.  He should try to get the price down closer to his $1,000,000 goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as 1050000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a price of 1150000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should still reject the offer. While it's closer to his desired price, he can likely get a better deal with further negotiation.  He's still within his budget, and has time to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,100,000?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as 1100000. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer you a price of 1125000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept the offer.  At this point, he's at $1,125,000, which is still below his maximum budget and getting close to his desired price of $1,000,000.  There's a chance he could negotiate further, but there's also a chance Alice will walk away. He should take the deal and avoid the risk of losing the product or having to buy from John for a higher price."
