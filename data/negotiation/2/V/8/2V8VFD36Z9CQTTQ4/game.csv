"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as 1050000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a price of 1150000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1150000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1100000?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away happy.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as 1100000. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer you a price of 1125000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
