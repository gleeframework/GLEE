"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  $6,000 is a very good price, but it's too early to know if it's Alice's best offer. By rejecting, I can gauge her willingness to negotiate and potentially get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4500} 
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 25% discount. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating and sets a lower starting point for further negotiations.  It's likely Alice will reject this, but it will give us a better understanding of her bottom line."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** While $5,250 is a good price, I'm still hoping to get it lower. Alice has shown some willingness to negotiate, and by rejecting this offer, I can push for a price closer to my initial counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4750} 
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer slightly to $4,750. This shows Alice that I'm serious about closing the deal but still aiming for a substantial discount. It's a reasonable compromise, and if accepted, it will be a good deal for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come up a little in her price, but it's still a good deal compared to buying from John.  We've had a few rounds of negotiation, and it's getting close to the halfway point. Continuing to haggle risks losing the deal altogether. Accepting this offer is the best option to secure the product at a reasonable price."
