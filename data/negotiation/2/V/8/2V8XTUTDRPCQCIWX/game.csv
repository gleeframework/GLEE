"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $850,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and still a great price for the value you'll get from the product. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is my maximum budget.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my financial constraints. I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",800000.0,Bob,4,
