"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm asking for $175 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting price is far too high. It's significantly more than your $100 limit and even above her own valuation. Rejecting this offer and providing a counter-offer is the best way to start negotiating a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from a starting point significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for bargaining.
* **Reasonable but Firm:** $80 is a significant drop from Alice's initial price but still leaves room for her to come down while staying within your budget. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message emphasizes your interest while remaining firm on your budget constraints."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, thanks for your interest!  $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $120?  That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, which is good, but $120 is still above your $100 limit. You have some bargaining power because you have the option to buy from John for $100.  It's worth seeing if you can negotiate a better price with Alice before going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm getting closer to my budget, but $120 is still a little bit of a stretch for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $100?  That's the highest I can go."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Firm:** This offer makes it clear that $100 is your absolute maximum. It's important to be firm at this stage to signal your limits.
* **Justification:** By explaining this is your highest possible offer, you avoid sounding arbitrary and give Alice a reason to accept.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  While not always a guarantee of success, proposing a middle ground can be a persuasive tactic in negotiation."
