"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Even though $120 is more than the product is worth to Alice, it's still a better deal for Bob than buying from John for $150. 
* **Bob's goal is to save money:**  Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at the lowest possible price within his budget."
