"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $11500.  It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a price below its worth to you, and I get a good return on my investment. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
