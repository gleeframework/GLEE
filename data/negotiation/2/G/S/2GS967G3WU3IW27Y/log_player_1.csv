**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly anchored at a price point significantly lower than our desired outcome. He's moving in small increments, and at this rate, we're unlikely to reach a deal significantly better than John's offer within the remaining rounds.  It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
