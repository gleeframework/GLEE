"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) but still within a reasonable range for Bob, considering his value is $100. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive message to build rapport with Bob. 
* **Direct Offer:** I'm clearly stating my offer and asking for his opinion, inviting him to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** I haven't exhausted all my rounds and there's still potential to get a better price from Bob. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate that I'm serious about getting a fair price and I'm not desperate to sell at his low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $80 is unfortunately far too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we meet in the middle at $125? This would still give you a great deal, and it's fair to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but still showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my initial offer and his offer, showing flexibility.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob that $125 is still a good deal for him, considering the product's worth to him is $100.
* **Positive and Engaging:** My message is friendly and encouraging, keeping the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Alice.  While $125 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget. Could you maybe do $95? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **More rounds left:**  I have more rounds to try and get a better price from Bob.
* **Holding out for a better deal:**  I'm not desperate to sell and I believe I can potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer!  $95 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $110? That's still a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to come down further but still holding onto a decent profit.
* **Maintain leverage:** I'm not rushing to accept his offer, suggesting that I have other options.
* **Positive tone:** The message remains friendly and focuses on finding a solution that works for both parties.
* **Closing the deal:** I'm emphasizing that $110 is a good deal and encouraging Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $100? That's my final offer, and I think it's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is at my minimum:** While $100 is my minimum acceptable price, I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation. 
* **Time is a factor:**  With only 4 rounds left, I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a lower offer. 
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $50, which is better than potentially losing more time and getting a lower price from Bob. 

I'm confident that John will buy the product at my asking price, so it's in my best interest to secure the deal now."
