Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $80 is unfortunately far too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we meet in the middle at $125? This would still give you a great deal, and it's fair to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Even though Alice is coming down, we're still aiming to get a much better deal or just buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Alice.  While $125 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget. Could you maybe do $95? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer!  $95 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $110? That's still a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is definitely getting closer to a price we'd consider, but we're still holding out for a better deal or the option to buy from John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $100? That's my final offer, and I think it's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** We have a strong fallback option with John at $100. Alice knows we're negotiating and risks losing the sale entirely. 
* **Finality:** Presenting it as our ""final offer"" adds weight and encourages Alice to accept rather than risk further negotiation. 
* **Fairness:** While $100 is the most beneficial to us, it's still within our acceptable range and avoids lowballing Alice at this stage."
