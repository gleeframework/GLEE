"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but  $900,000 is more than I'm willing to spend.  Would you consider a lower price, closer to  $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $850,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget. How about we settle at $750,000?  I believe that's a fair offer reflecting the product's value and my interest.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
