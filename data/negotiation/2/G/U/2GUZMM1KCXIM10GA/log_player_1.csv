{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $1,200,000 is still below the value I see in this product.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1350000. How about we settle on $1275000?

I'm still aiming for a higher price. $1,275,000 is getting closer to my desired range, but I'm going to hold out for a bit longer. Let's see if I can get Bob to come up a bit more."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not too far apart on price. Let's try to reach a compromise.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm starting to feel the pressure of time and the potential sale to John, I still believe I can get a better price from Bob. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can close the deal."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  We're down to the wire and I'm not confident that I can get Bob to meet my desired price.  While it's not ideal to sell at the minimum, it's better than risking losing out on the deal entirely."
