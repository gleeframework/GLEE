"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,750,000 is significantly more than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to start setting a better price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go over $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price reflects the value you'll gain from owning this product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's work towards a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than the initial offer, it's still too high for Bob's budget.  Bob should continue to negotiate to try and get the price down further.  He has room to maneuver and potentially reach a deal that works for both of them."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000, which is a significant jump from my previous offer. This is my best offer, let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your constraints.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to lower my price to $1,450,000. This is a substantial concession, and I'm hoping you see the value in accepting this offer.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a significant drop from Alice's previous offers, it's still above Bob's comfortable price range. There's still room for negotiation and Bob can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. He should counter with a price closer to his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit, but $1,450,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a serious offer, and I hope you'll consider it.  Let's find a way to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's try to find a mutually agreeable solution. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,425,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and your budget.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  While Alice has lowered her price significantly, it's still above Bob's ideal budget.  He's already had a few rounds of negotiation and the price isn't moving much closer to his target.  John offers a guaranteed price within Bob's budget, and it's a safer option at this point."
