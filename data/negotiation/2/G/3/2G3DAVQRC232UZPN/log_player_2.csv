"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business.  I'm confident it's worth at least $1200000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that will be mutually beneficial. Let's discuss a price that makes sense for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:**  $1,000,000
* **Your Maximum Willingness to Pay:** $1,200,000
* **John's Price:** $1,200,000

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $200,000 compared to buying from John. While you could potentially negotiate with Alice for a lower price, there's no guarantee she'll budge, and you risk losing the deal entirely."
