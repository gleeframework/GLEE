,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $140?  I'm genuinely interested, and I think this could be a good deal for both of us.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $140 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit though. How about $155?  That feels like a fair price for both of us.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $155 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $150.  If you're not able to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",150.0,Bob,4,
