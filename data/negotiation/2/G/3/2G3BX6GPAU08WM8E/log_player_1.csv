Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your $8,000 floor price.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob likely sees the value at $12,000, so there's space for him to counteroffer and for you to potentially come down a bit.
* **It's aggressive:** By starting high, you maximize your potential profit. 

Remember, you can always walk away and sell to John for $8,000 if the negotiations don't go your way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget of $12,000. Let me know if you can work with me on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, you can likely get a better price by counteroffering. You know he's willing to pay up to $12,000, so there's room to negotiate.  By rejecting his offer, you can explore if there's a middle ground that works for both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  How about we split the difference?  I'd be willing to come down to $10,250.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to stay within my limits. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is a good deal for you. It's well above your minimum of $8,000 and it's closer to your ideal price point.  It's also a good sign that Bob is serious about buying the product. Continuing to negotiate might risk losing him as a buyer."
