"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,600,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original price. How about $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe the product is worth more, but $1,350,000 is still a stretch for me.  Let's split the difference and try $1,200,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
