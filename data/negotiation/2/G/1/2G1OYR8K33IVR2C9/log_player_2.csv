"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $120 is better than $150 from John, it's still more than the product is worth to you.  There's room for negotiation to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between Alice's offer and my maximum value.  This shows I'm serious about buying, but also that I'm willing to negotiate.  There's a good chance Alice will accept this offer, but if not, we can continue to haggle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is higher than my last counteroffer.  I want to see if she's willing to come down further.  If she keeps going up, I'll likely buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm sticking to my strategy of offering halfway between Alice's last price and my maximum. If Alice is unwilling to budge, I'll be forced to go to John in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is not budging on her price.  It seems like she's aiming for a price closer to her value, while I'm aiming for a price closer to mine.  There's no clear indication that she'll come down, so buying from John at this point is a better option than risking further negotiation."
