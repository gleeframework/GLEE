"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire this truly unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth in the market.

Alice's offer is way too high. It's important to start the negotiation by showing Alice that you are serious about buying the product but also serious about getting a good deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay.  Considering its value to me, I'd be interested in purchasing the product for $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth while still allowing us both to benefit from the transaction."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the inherent value of this product. While your offer is thoughtful, the $1,300,000 price point doesn't quite reflect the full scope of what's being offered.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to consider $1,800,000. This allows me to make concessions while ensuring the deal remains beneficial for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still too high. You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000 from John, so there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,800,000 is still too far from my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000 for the product. This price is fair considering its value and allows us to both reach an agreement. Let's try to find common ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I understand this is a significant investment, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. To meet you closer to your budget, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end while still acknowledging the true value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice's offer is tempting and getting closer, it's still too high. We are very close to closing a deal with John, so we need to push Alice to come down further."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and coming down in price. However, $1,650,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer a final price of $1,500,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to close this deal. Let's reach an agreement and avoid having to go through more negotiation rounds."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
