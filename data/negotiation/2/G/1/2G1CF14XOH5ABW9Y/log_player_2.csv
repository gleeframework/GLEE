"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,000,000.  It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great fit for your needs.  While I'm confident you'll find this a good deal, I have another interested buyer waiting in the wings should you decline.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to establish a sense of urgency and scarcity by mentioning another interested buyer.  While she might be telling the truth, her primary goal is to get you to accept her full asking price. Since you have John as a fallback option at the same price, there's no harm in rejecting Alice's offer. You might be able to find a better deal elsewhere or negotiate a lower price with Alice later."
