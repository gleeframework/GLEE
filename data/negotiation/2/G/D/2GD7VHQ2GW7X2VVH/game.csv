"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $105?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $108.",108.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $108 is still a little more than I'm prepared to pay. How about we split the difference and go with $106? I think that would be a fair price for both of us.",106.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your point, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about we compromise at $109?",109.0,Alice,5,
