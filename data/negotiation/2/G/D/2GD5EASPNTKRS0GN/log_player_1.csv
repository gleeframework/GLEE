"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value, justifying the high initial price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrasing ""starting price"" implies willingness to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage. 
 
This strategy aims to gauge Bob's eagerness and establish a strong position for the rest of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your starting price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $700,000? I think that's a fair deal considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly below our minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While his counter-offer was expected after our high starting point, accepting this would be a considerable loss. 

We are still in the early stages of negotiation, and we have the option to sell to John for our minimum. Therefore, it's strategically advantageous to reject Bob's offer and present a counter-offer closer to our desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it can bring you a substantial return. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $875,000?"", 
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging & Bridging:** We start by acknowledging Bob's offer and perspective to maintain a positive negotiation environment.
* **Firm but Fair:** We clearly state $700,000 is too low while reiterating the product's value to justify a higher price.
* **Compromise:** We propose a counter-offer of $875,000,  meeting Bob halfway between his offer and our initial ask. This demonstrates flexibility while still aiming for a strong profit margin. 

This counter-offer tests Bob's willingness to move closer to our desired price point. We remain open to further negotiation but keep John's offer as a potential alternative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $875,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Would you consider $750,000? I feel this represents a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Bob increased his offer, $750,000 is still below our acceptable minimum of $800,000.  We need to show Bob we are willing to walk away if he doesn't meet our price point.  We'll reject his offer and present a counter-offer that is closer to our minimum, but still leaves room for a small amount of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $750,000 is cutting it too close.  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations, but I do have other opportunities to consider.  My best offer is $850,000.  This is a fair deal given the product's value."", 
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:** We are becoming more assertive, directly stating his offer is too low and introducing the idea of other opportunities (John).
* **Finality:**  By saying ""My best offer,"" we signal that we are nearing the limit of our flexibility. 
* **Justification:** We re-emphasize the product's value to justify the price while keeping the tone positive.

This counter-offer creates a sense of urgency while still offering Bob a chance to secure the product at a price below his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is a valuable product, and I'm willing to meet you closer to your price. How about $800,000? This is a strong offer, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has finally met our minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While we could try to push for more in the remaining rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that further negotiation could become protracted. 

Accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids the potential risk of losing the deal altogether."
