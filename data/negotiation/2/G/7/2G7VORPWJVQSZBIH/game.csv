"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $1,000,000 to start negotiations.  Given its worth, I believe this is a fair starting point, but I'm open to discussing the price further.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer reflects. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This is a substantial reduction, reflecting my willingness to negotiate, but I cannot go any lower. ",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $850,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $925,000, which is $862,500. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",862500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. While $862,500 is closer to what I envisioned, I'm still seeking a price that reflects its true worth.  My final offer is $890,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's more than fair. ",890000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm afraid I need to stick to my previous offer of $862,500. I'm not comfortable going above that price. I hope we can agree on this.",862500.0,Bob,6,
