"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you're interested in. I'm asking for $110 for it. Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and go with $95? That's still a good deal for both of us.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $85. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. But $85 is a little too low for me.  How about we settle on $90? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I still think $90 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you at $87. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",87.0,Bob,6,
