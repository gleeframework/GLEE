"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $120 is a bit out of my budget.  How about $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I have to make a living. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet halfway again at $105.  This price would allow me to purchase the product and still be within my budget.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit hesitant, Bob. I've already compromised a lot. I'm willing to go down to $108, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. It's a great product, and I think it's worth more than that. Let's see if we can meet at $108.",108.0,Alice,5,
