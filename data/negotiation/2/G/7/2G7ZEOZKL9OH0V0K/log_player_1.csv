Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy and the offer:

**Strategy:**

The key here is understanding that you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 from John. This becomes your ""backup plan"" and allows you to push for a higher price with Bob.  Since the product is worth the same amount to Bob as it is to you, a successful negotiation will involve finding a price that is appealing to him but also significantly above your minimum.

**Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase [product name].  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000.  I believe this reflects the significant return on investment you'll see."",
""product_price"": 1900000 
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High but Reasonable:** The offer is significantly higher than your minimum ($1,500,000) but not so high as to be immediately dismissed as unreasonable.
* **Emphasis on Value:** The message highlights the ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high price.
* **Return on Investment:** By mentioning ""return on investment,"" you frame the purchase in terms of Bob's potential financial gain, making it more appealing. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared to negotiate. Bob may counter-offer, and you'll need to decide how low you are willing to go. Remember, you always have John's offer as a safety net.
* **Relationship:** Consider your long-term relationship with Bob. If a deal isn't struck, maintain a positive rapport for potential future opportunities."
