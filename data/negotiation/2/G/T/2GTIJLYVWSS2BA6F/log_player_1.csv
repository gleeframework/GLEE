{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe is worth a lot to you.  I'm willing to let it go for $14,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

This offer starts high, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also encourages Bob to engage by asking for his opinion, making him feel involved in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my minimum desired price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired $14,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle at $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is close enough to my desired price that I'm willing to accept it. It's higher than John's offer, and while I could try to squeeze out a little more from Bob, it's not worth risking the sale."
