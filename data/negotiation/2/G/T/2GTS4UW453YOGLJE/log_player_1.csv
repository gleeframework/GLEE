Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value."", ""product_price"": 119}
```

Here's why this is a good strategy for Alice:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Alice starts by aiming for the highest price Bob might reasonably accept. While $120 is her minimum, getting closer to $119 increases her potential profit.
* **Creates Urgency:** The ""limited time"" phrase adds a bit of pressure for Bob to decide quickly. 
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:**  While unlikely in this scenario (as Bob only values the product at $100), starting high leaves Alice room to potentially lower the price slightly if Bob tries to negotiate.

It's important to note that while this strategy maximizes Alice's potential profit from Bob, there's no guarantee Bob will accept.  If he rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale with John at her minimum acceptable price."
