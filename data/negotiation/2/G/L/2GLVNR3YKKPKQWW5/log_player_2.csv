"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price. Given its value to you, I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial arrangement. I propose selling the product to you for $140. This price reflects its high quality and the significant benefit it will bring to you, while ensuring a fair return for us. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $140.** This is less than what you are willing to pay ($150) and more than what Alice needs to make a profit ($120).
* **Buying from John for $150 is a worse deal.** It's better to accept Alice's offer and save $10."
