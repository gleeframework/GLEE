Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it would be a valuable asset to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,190,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1190000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Our goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible since we have a guaranteed buyer in John.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $800,000.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering a price slightly below John's offer ($1,200,000) creates the perception of a deal for Bob while maximizing our potential profit.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer without excessive negotiation. 

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Depending on Bob's personality and negotiation style, we might need to adjust our offer slightly. However, going below $1,150,000 would significantly reduce our potential profit margin, making it more logical to proceed with John."
