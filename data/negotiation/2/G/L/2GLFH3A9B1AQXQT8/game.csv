"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Can you meet me at this price?",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we split the difference and settle on $13,250?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.",13250.0,Alice,3,
