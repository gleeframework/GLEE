"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. There's room to negotiate a lower price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $90?"", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We want to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below our $120 maximum and John's offer.
* **Polite & Direct:** Maintaining a positive tone encourages continued negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. How about we settle in the middle at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $100 is a reasonable compromise. It's significantly lower than our maximum budget and John's offer. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate might get the price a little lower, but the difference is likely small. Accepting now guarantees the product at a good price."
