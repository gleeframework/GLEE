"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value and appreciate your enthusiasm. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider a price up to $1,500,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,500,000 is too low for what this product offers.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? I believe that's a fair reflection of its value.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I'm still working within a specific budget. Would it be possible to lower the price to $1,600,000? This would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
