"Hi Alice,  $1100000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1050000 is still a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1075000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
