Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe holds significant value. I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000.  This is a substantial offer, and I'm confident you'll find it worth your investment.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $750000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, it's important to remember that I have 10 rounds and the option to sell to John for $1,000,000. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially reach a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I believe the product is worth significantly more, I'm willing to compromise. I'm offering a price of $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and gives you a good deal.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1250000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to pay $1000000.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is exactly the price I can get from John. Since I'm not confident I can get a higher price from Bob within the remaining rounds, it's more efficient to sell to John and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000.  This eliminates further negotiation and potential risk."
