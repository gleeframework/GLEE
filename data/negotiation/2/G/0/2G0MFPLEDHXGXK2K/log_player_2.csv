"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe holds significant value. I'm offering it to you for $1500000.  This is a substantial offer, and I'm confident you'll find it worth your investment.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far above Bob's budget. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I'm only willing to pay $750,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process by offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still demonstrates Bob's interest in the product. The message shows willingness to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I believe the product is worth significantly more, I'm willing to compromise. I'm offering a price of $1250000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and gives you a good deal.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to Bob's desired price, but $1,250,000 is still above Bob's budget and within the range where it makes sense to continue negotiating. There's still room to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering the maximum amount he is willing to pay. This is a strong counteroffer, signaling his seriousness about acquiring the product while remaining within his budget. It's a fair offer, pushing Alice to decide whether she's willing to accept it or risk losing the deal to John."
