Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to hopefully get Bob interested.
* **Flexibility:**  I'm leaving the door open for negotiation, which is important in this scenario.  
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me a safety net and allows me to be more aggressive in my negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000 and is even below Bob's own perceived value of $10,000.  
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and try to get a better price.
* **John's Value:**  I can use John's offer of $15,000 as leverage during negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm countering Bob's offer with $11,000, which is still higher than his offer but closer to his perceived value.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to maintain a good relationship with Bob.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing that $11,000 is a fair price for both of us, which can help Bob feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Leverage:** I'm still keeping in mind that I can sell to John for $15,000, which gives me confidence in my negotiation stance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. Can we make it work? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Value:** Bob's offer of $10,500 is very close to my minimum value of $10,000.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I could potentially counteroffer again, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I'd be left with John's offer of $15,000. 
* **Time & Effort:**  Accepting Bob's offer minimizes the time and effort involved in further negotiation.
* **Stronger Relationship:** Accepting Bob's offer could also build a stronger relationship with Bob, which could be beneficial for future business."
