"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $1,200,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still securing a profit well above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to show flexibility and encourage Bob to meet me halfway.  $1,050,000 is still a good profit for me, and leaves room for further negotiation."
