"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me, while allowing us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to get closer to the product's true value. Considering our previous discussion, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, while still being within my budget. I believe this is a good compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
