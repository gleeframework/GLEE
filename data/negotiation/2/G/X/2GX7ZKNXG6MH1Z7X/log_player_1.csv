Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a good starting point, as it's higher than my minimum price but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob at $11,500. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway while still ensuring I get a price closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to sell for more, Bob's offer is very close to John's offer. There's a risk that if I keep rejecting, Bob will walk away and I'll be stuck selling to John. It's better to take the $10,500 and secure the sale."
