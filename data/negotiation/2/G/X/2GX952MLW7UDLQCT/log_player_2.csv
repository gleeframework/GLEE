"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I know will be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm confident it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us.  Would you be interested in purchasing it for $1,250,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
