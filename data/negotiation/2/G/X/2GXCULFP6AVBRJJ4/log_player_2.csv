Alice's offer is still too high. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above your desired price point and you can likely negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating."

This counteroffer is a good compromise. It's lower than Alice's last offer, but it's closer to her desired selling price, making it more likely she'll accept."

Alice is not budging and her price is getting closer to John's price. It's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate with Alice. You can secure the product from John for a price that's within your budget."
