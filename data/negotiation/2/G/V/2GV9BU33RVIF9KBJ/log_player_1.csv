{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to me.  I'm offering it to you for $140.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I want to maximize my profit, so I'm starting with a price that's higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but still within a reasonable range. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $140 leaves room for me to negotiate down if needed, while still earning more than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Friendly tone:**  I'm keeping the tone friendly and open to negotiation to encourage Bob to respond positively."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While I want to sell the product, Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob, especially since he expressed interest.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John for $150 is guaranteed, but I want to try to maximize my earnings. There's a chance I can get a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $125 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $135?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to where I need to be."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm showing flexibility and willingness to compromise by offering a price that's the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is still a good deal for him at this price, even though it's a bit higher than he initially offered.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  I'm continuing to be friendly and open to negotiation, hoping to encourage Bob to accept my offer."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $125 is a fair price for me. Can you meet me at $130?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  There's a good chance I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob, especially since he's shown continued interest.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John for $150 is guaranteed, but I'm aiming for the highest possible profit.  I'm willing to take the risk of continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer! I'm happy to come down a little more to $132.  It's still a good deal for you, and it's just a little more than my minimum. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 132}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:** I'm making a small concession, showing flexibility without dropping below my minimum.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is still a good deal at this price.
* **Finality:** I'm suggesting this is a good final offer, hoping to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $128 is a more reasonable price for me. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below $150. 
* **Negotiation fatigue:**  We've gone back and forth several times, and I'm starting to feel the negotiation is becoming unproductive.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's a chance Bob might come up to my minimum, it's not guaranteed.  I don't want to risk losing time and potentially missing out on John's guaranteed offer of $150.

Selling to John guarantees my minimum acceptable price and allows me to move on with my business."
