Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a highly worthwhile investment for you.  I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:**  We start with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than John's guaranteed offer. This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit beyond John's offer.
* **Emphasizing Value:** The message focuses on the product's value and potential, subtly anchoring the discussion around its benefits rather than just the price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is open for discussion, suggesting flexibility without explicitly stating it. This encourages Bob to counter-offer if he's interested.

**Why this strategy?**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  The ideal scenario is to get Bob to agree to a price closer to $1,500,000. 
* **Secure a Sale:** While we have John as a backup, closing the deal with Bob avoids potential delays or complications that could arise with another buyer."
