"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product, I think you'd really find it useful. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I believe I can find something similar within my budget. I am willing to pay $120 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is offering the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept. There's no room for negotiation upwards from his offer. I can secure the same amount by selling to John immediately, saving time and potential further haggling."
