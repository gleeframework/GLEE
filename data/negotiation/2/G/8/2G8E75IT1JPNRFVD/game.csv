"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product brings to the table is significant, and $1,100,000 is a fair reflection of that.  To move us closer to a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is my final offer.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
