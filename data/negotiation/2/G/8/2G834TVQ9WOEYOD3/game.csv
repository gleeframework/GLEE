"Hello Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth at least $10000 to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $15000.  What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is there any room for negotiation?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $12000 is tempting, I'm not quite ready to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $13500.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",13500.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $13000. Can you consider that?,13000.0,Bob,4,
