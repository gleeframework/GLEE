This is a good point to accept the offer. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You've negotiated the price down to $500,000, a $300,000 savings from John's price and a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer. 
* **Time Value:**  You've used 7 of your 10 rounds.  Continuing to negotiate risks Alice becoming firmer in her price or you running out of time and having to buy from John at the higher price.
* **Alice's Stance:**  Alice has stated this is her ""absolute limit"". While it's possible she could go lower, it's risky to assume that.

Accepting the $500,000 offer secures a good deal on the product and avoids the risk of losing the opportunity."
