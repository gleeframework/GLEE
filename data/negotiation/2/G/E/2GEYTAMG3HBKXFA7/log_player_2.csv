# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $12,000. I think it's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  You can get the product for $12,000 from Alice, which is less than the $15,000 you'd pay John. 
* **You're saving money:**  Even though you're paying more than the product's value to Alice ($10,000), you're still saving $3,000 compared to buying from John."
