Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $90. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 
 
This offer aims to maximize profit while still being enticing to Bob:

* **High but Acceptable Price:** $90 is below Bob's perceived value ($100) making it a good deal for him.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer starts high, the friendly tone leaves room for Bob to negotiate if he wants.
* **Secures Profit:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice is secure knowing she can sell to John for her minimum acceptable price ($80)."
