I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me a good starting point for negotiation and hopefully leaves room for some back-and-forth before I need to consider selling to John for the minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While I'm happy to get the minimum price I'm willing to accept, I'm going to try and get closer to my initial price.  There's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $1,350,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a good amount for me. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer is a good compromise. It's above my minimum and getting closer to my initial asking price. It's worth accepting to avoid further back-and-forth and ensure I get a good price."
