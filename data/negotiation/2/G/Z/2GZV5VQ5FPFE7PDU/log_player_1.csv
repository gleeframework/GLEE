"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We start with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to leave room for negotiation and maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room:** The offer is $100,000 below Bob's perceived value, giving him an incentive to negotiate while still securing a significant profit for Alice if accepted.
* **Polite and Professional:** The tone is crucial for a successful negotiation.  We maintain a respectful and open approach to encourage a positive dialogue with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly below our minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, it's still a starting point. We have room to negotiate and try to meet somewhere closer to the middle.
* **John as Backup:** We'll keep John in mind as a backup, but we're confident we can secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is a significant way off from what I had in mind.  To be frank, I wouldn't be able to go any lower than $1,050,000.  I believe that's a fair compromise, considering its potential value to you."", 
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** We're moving closer to the middle ground by countering with a price that's roughly halfway between Bob's offer ($900,000) and our previous offer ($1,100,000).
* **Firm but Fair:** We're maintaining firmness by stating a clear ""walk-away"" point ($1,050,000). This shows Bob we're serious while still allowing room for some negotiation.
* **Emphasizing Value:** We reiterate the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits and justifying the higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is a substantial profit above our minimum of $800,000.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob has demonstrated a willingness to negotiate by meeting us close to the middle ground. This suggests he's serious about closing the deal. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While we might be able to push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob could walk away. Accepting this offer secures a very good deal."
