"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! I'm offering you this product, which is worth at least $10,000 to me, for a price that I believe is fair and beneficial for both of us. Let's discuss a price that works for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to start the negotiation above her own valuation of the product. While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room to negotiate a better price. By rejecting this initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a more competitive price."
