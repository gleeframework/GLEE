Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save some money if possible. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than his initial offer, I can likely get closer to my target price by negotiating further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $8,500 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to earn a fair amount for my product."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to find common ground here. While I appreciate your offer, I'm simply not willing to go below $9,000.  That price is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product. If you're not willing to meet me there, I might have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 9000}
