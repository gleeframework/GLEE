"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's lower than John's price, it's still above what the product is worth to Alice ($1,200,000). This means there's room for negotiation.
* **We have 10 rounds:** This gives us time to try and get a better price.

**Next Steps:**  We'll counteroffer with a lower price, hoping to get closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I'm going to need to come in lower than $1,450,000. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not unreasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still within the range where we can potentially find a compromise. It signals our serious intent while also leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Focus on value:** We've mentioned being interested in the product, which suggests we see its value. But we're also emphasizing our need to get a price that works for us.

**Next Steps:** We'll see if Alice is willing to budge. If not, we can adjust our counteroffer in subsequent rounds, keeping in mind our goal of getting the best price possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,350,000 is still below what I need to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm going to need at least $1,400,000 to make this work.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** While Alice has come down a bit, her offer of $1,400,000 is still higher than what the product is worth to her and higher than our target price.  
* **Room for negotiation:**  We have a few more rounds left, and we can continue to explore a compromise that's fair for both of us. 

**Next Steps:** We'll counteroffer again, trying to bridge the gap further. We might consider offering $1,375,000, showing a willingness to move closer to her offer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm offering $1,375,000.  Let's try to close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This offer is exactly in the middle of our previous counteroffer ($1,350,000) and Alice's latest offer ($1,400,000). It shows a commitment to finding a solution while still being within our budget.
* **Expressing urgency:**  We mention trying to ""close this deal,"" subtly suggesting that we're getting closer to our limit and potentially implying that other options are available if we can't reach an agreement.

**Next Steps:** We'll see if this counteroffer is enough to convince Alice. If not, we might need to consider raising our offer slightly or prepare to walk away and explore other options."
