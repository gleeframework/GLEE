"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I'm going to need to come in lower than $1,450,000. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,350,000 is still below what I need to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm going to need at least $1,400,000 to make this work.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm offering $1,375,000.  Let's try to close this deal. ",1375000.0,Bob,4,
