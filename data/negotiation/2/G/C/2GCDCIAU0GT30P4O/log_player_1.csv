Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I'm going to need to come in lower than $1,450,000. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I want to close the deal, $1,350,000 is still too low for me, and I believe there's room for negotiation.  I'm going to counter-offer and try to reach a price closer to my asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,350,000 is still below what I need to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm going to need at least $1,400,000 to make this work.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm offering $1,375,000.  Let's try to close this deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd love to get closer to my ideal price, $1,375,000 is a decent offer and the negotiation has already taken a few rounds. I'd rather not risk further delays or a potential counter-offer from Bob that could be even lower.  I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us."
