"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  I'm confident this price is fair, and I'm eager to work with you to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the product's value is significantly higher than what you're proposing.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you see in the product, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This offer shows my serious intent to buy, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is moving closer to a million, we still have room to negotiate. We're aiming to maximize profit, and accepting $900,000 now would leave a significant amount of potential money on the table."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to explore other options.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has signaled this is his final offer, and it's a reasonable amount. Accepting ensures a good profit without risking the deal by pushing further and potentially losing Bob altogether."
