Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm asking for $115 for it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $115 is more than your minimum of $100.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's room to come down in price if Bob counteroffers, but it also leaves you with a decent profit.
* **It's attractive to Bob:**  $115 is less than the product is worth to Bob ($120), making it a good deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $90 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. While I'd like to make a sale, I'm not willing to sell at a loss. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $105. This still gives me a fair profit and should be a great deal for you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $95. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $95 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below it.  I'm not confident I can get Bob to go higher, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price below what I'm comfortable with.  Selling to John for $100 ensures a guaranteed profit and less hassle than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
