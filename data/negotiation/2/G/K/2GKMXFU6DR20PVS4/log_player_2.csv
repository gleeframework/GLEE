"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $22,000.  I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you greatly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
 
Alice's offer is far higher than both your maximum price and John's offer.  It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way more than I'm looking to spend. I could do  $5,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 5000} 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a low offer gives you room to negotiate upwards.  While $5,000 is a significant difference from Alice's asking price, it's important to aim low and see how she responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $5,000 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate. How about $18,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is coming down, $18,000 is still significantly more than your $8,000 limit and John's offer. There's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $18,000 is still pretty steep for me though.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around  $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

**Reasoning:** 

* **Show willingness to negotiate:** By saying ""meet in the middle,"" you signal that you're open to finding a solution that works for both of you.
* **Significant jump from your last offer:**  Moving from $5,000 to $10,000 shows Alice you're serious but also keeps you well below her current price and your maximum. 
* **Still below your limit:** This offer keeps you in a position to potentially negotiate up a little further while staying under your $8,000 limit if needed."
