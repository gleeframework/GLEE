Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This offer stands until [set a reasonable deadline], after which I'll be moving forward with other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Deadline Creates Urgency:**  A deadline encourages Bob to make a decision promptly rather than delaying.
* **Alternative Option:**  Mentioning other interested parties (without being too aggressive) reminds Bob that he could lose the opportunity if he doesn't act. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Relationship:** If Alice values a long-term business relationship with Bob, she might consider a slightly lower price to foster goodwill. 
* **Bob's Negotiation Style:**  If Alice knows Bob to be a tough negotiator, she might want to start even higher to allow more room for concessions."
