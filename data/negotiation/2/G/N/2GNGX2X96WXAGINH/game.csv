,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,200,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your desired price and my maximum budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I can go right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,
