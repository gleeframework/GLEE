Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited-time price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to $120 as possible, as that's your guaranteed profit with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's very price-sensitive, but still nets you a good profit.
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding ""limited-time"" creates urgency and might make Bob more likely to accept without overthinking. 

**Important:** This assumes you don't know Bob's negotiation style. If you knew he was very likely to haggle, you might start higher."
