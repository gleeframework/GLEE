"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $180. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$180 offer:** This is a starting point above your minimum value, aiming to leave room for negotiation while still being profitable. 
* **Positive message:** Starting with a friendly message helps build rapport and makes Bob more open to the offer. 
* **Focus on value:** Highlighting the product's potential benefits for Bob makes him more likely to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** Starting high leaves room for negotiation and increases the chance of achieving a higher selling price.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** Bob's response will give insights into his perceived value of the product.
* **Leave room for future negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, you can lower the price strategically in subsequent rounds based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:**  While $120 is your minimum acceptable price, it's still worth trying to negotiate a higher price. Bob is clearly interested, and you still have 8 rounds left to potentially get closer to your initial asking price.
* **Strategic negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make a counteroffer in the next round, potentially securing a price closer to your desired range. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer slightly above Bob's offer, keeping in mind the value of the product and the remaining rounds. This approach will allow me to assess Bob's willingness to pay and potentially secure a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is a good starting point, I'm looking to get closer to $150 to make this work. Would you be willing to come up a bit?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  This counteroffer is $30 higher than Bob's offer,  attempting to split the difference between your initial offer and his offer. This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a better price.
* **Positive tone:**  A friendly message keeps the negotiation positive, making Bob more open to negotiation.
* **Focus on compromise:**  The message acknowledges Bob's offer while highlighting your need to receive a higher price.

**Strategy:**

This approach aims to:

* **Find a middle ground:** The counteroffer sets a new target price that is more appealing than your initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Test Bob's limits:** Bob's response will reveal how committed he is to purchasing the product and how much he is willing to pay.
* **Maintain leverage:** By not accepting Bob's offer, you maintain some leverage in the negotiation, potentially leading to a higher price in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand where you're coming from, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $150. How about we meet in the middle at $135? Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Accepting Bob's offer:** While $135 is slightly below my initial target, it's still a significant improvement from Bob's first offer and above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time constraints:** With only 6 rounds remaining, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  While I could try to push for a higher price, there's a chance Bob might walk away, and I would be forced to sell to John for a lower price.

**Strategy:**

This decision balances the desire for a higher price with the risk of losing the deal entirely.  Accepting Bob's offer secures a reasonable profit while also mitigating the risk of a lower price from John or a breakdown in negotiations with Bob."
