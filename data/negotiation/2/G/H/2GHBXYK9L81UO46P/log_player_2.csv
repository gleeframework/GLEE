"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $80 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $90.  This is above Bob's maximum price.
* Bob has the option to buy from John for $80, which is a better deal.
* Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. 
* Offering $75 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $90.
* This price is still within Bob's budget, making it a reasonable counteroffer. 
* Bob wants to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially get a price closer to his target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* While Alice's offer of $85 is closer to Bob's target price, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.
* Bob has a better alternative in buying from John for $80.
* Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating with Alice and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to get the product for $80, which is the price he can get from John.
*  This counteroffer is the minimum price Bob is willing to pay.
*  It's a fair offer, as it's the same price Alice is willing to sell the product for. 
* This counteroffer puts the pressure on Alice to decide if she wants to close the deal or risk losing the sale to John."
