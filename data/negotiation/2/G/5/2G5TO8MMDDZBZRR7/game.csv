"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a rare and valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can you meet me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $900000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1000000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950000. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still a bit above your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1050000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target, but I'm still not comfortable with $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $1025000 is my absolute maximum. Can you consider that?",1025000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1025000. I'm thinking that we're getting close to a deal, and I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1075000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,7,
