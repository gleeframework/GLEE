"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a happy middle ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this sale work for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is a significant compromise on my end. I believe this price is fair and allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still a bit higher than my target price, but I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair compromise for both of us, and I believe it will allow us to finalize this deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
