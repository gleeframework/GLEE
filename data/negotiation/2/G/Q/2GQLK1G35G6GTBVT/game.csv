"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $12000. This is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, I'm currently looking to spend closer to $9000. Would you be willing to consider that price?  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to spend closer to $9000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $10500. This is the lowest I can go without compromising the value of the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  While $10500 is closer to my range, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $10000? This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair value for the product.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $10000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $11000. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
