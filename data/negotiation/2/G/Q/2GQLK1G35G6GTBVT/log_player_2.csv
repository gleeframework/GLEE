"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $12000. This is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Bob is willing to pay up to $12,000, there's no need to accept Alice's initial offer. By rejecting, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to accept a lower offer, saving Bob some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, I'm currently looking to spend closer to $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend closer to $9000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $10500. This is the lowest I can go without compromising the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible.  Alice's counteroffer of $10,500 is better than her initial price, but it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.  Rejecting allows for further negotiation and potentially a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  While $10,500 is closer to my range, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $10,000?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $10000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $11000. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $11,000 is less than Bob's maximum of $12,000.
* **No further negotiation is likely:** Alice has made it clear that $11,000 is her minimum price, and further counteroffers are unlikely to lead to a lower price. 
* **Buying from John is not beneficial:**  John's price is $12,000, so accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $1,000.

While Bob might prefer to pay less, it's strategically better to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a price that's within his budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a stalemate or a higher price from John."
