Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the significant value this brings. How about we consider $1,900,000? This is a substantial reduction on my part, and I believe it represents a fair compromise.

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a workable number.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I value our negotiation. To demonstrate my seriousness, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  This is my best offer, and I think it represents a significant opportunity for you.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the gap between our positions remains significant. I need to be realistic about my options.
