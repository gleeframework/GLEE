{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $115, which is slightly above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for compromise:** By starting at $115, I have the potential to lower the price a bit if needed without dropping below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Positive framing:** The message is friendly and highlights the value of the product. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while keeping the negotiation open and giving Bob an incentive to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $105 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. Accepting it would result in a loss. 
* **Negotiation opportunity:** Although Bob's offer is low, he is still interested. Rejecting his offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Selling to John is not ideal:** While selling to John for $120 is my fallback option, it's not my preferred outcome. I'd rather try to negotiate a better price with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to leverage my position and potentially get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution that benefits both of us.
* **Emphasis on fairness:**  The message highlights the fairness of the proposed price, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Maintain a firm stance:** While offering a compromise, I still maintain my stance that $110 is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This prevents Bob from assuming he can push me further down.

This counteroffer aims to balance finding a mutually agreeable price while ensuring I still get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $110. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? I'm willing to compromise, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $107.50 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob is closer to my desired price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my target.
* **Selling to John is a safe option:**  If I can't get a better offer from Bob, I can always sell to John for $120.  However, I'm not ready to give up on negotiating a better price with Bob yet.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation process and try to reach a more favorable price for myself."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to compromise. However, $107.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $110. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Sticking to my ground:** I'm reiterating my previous offer of $110, showing that I'm serious about that price. 
* **Reinforcing fairness:** I emphasize fairness and the compromise nature of my offer.
* **Setting a firm limit:** I'm making it clear that $110 is my absolute bottom line. 

This counteroffer aims to convey my firmness while leaving the door open for a final agreement. It acknowledges Bob's compromise while subtly pressuring him to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to make a profit, but I really like this product and I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a good deal. I'll go as low as $105, but that's my final offer. If you can meet me at that price, I'll buy the product from you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's final offer is below my minimum:**  His final offer of $105 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **No further negotiation:**  Bob has stated it's his final offer, indicating he's unlikely to budge further.
* **John's offer is a secure alternative:** Selling to John for $120 ensures I get my desired price and avoid a loss.

Although I'd prefer to make a profit by negotiating with Bob, I don't want to risk ending up with a lower price than my minimum. Selling to John is the most secure option, guaranteeing I'll get the minimum I need."
