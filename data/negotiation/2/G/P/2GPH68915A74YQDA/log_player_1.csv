Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $150 is a bit steep for me, especially since I'm looking for a good deal. I'm willing to pay $80, which is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120. That still gives you a good price, and allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 120}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $120 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $100?  That would be a fair compromise.
