"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product but $100 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $65 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $90, but that's my final offer.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I understand it's a good product, Alice, but I'm on a tight budget. Could we meet in the middle somewhere, perhaps around $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $75 is still below what I can accept. How about we split the difference and go with $85? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I can do $80, but that's really stretching my budget.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is still just a bit too low for me.  How about we compromise at $82.50?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I want to make this deal work.",82.5,Alice,7,
