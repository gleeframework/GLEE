Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $75 is still below what I can accept. How about we split the difference and go with $85? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is still just a bit too low for me.  How about we compromise at $82.50?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I want to make this deal work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go down to $80. It's better to cut your losses and buy from John at your target price."
