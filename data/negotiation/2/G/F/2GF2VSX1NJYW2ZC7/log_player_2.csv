"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get a better price by negotiating with Alice. There are 9 rounds left, and Bob has room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you and my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Reasonable:** Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate. However, it's not drastically low, leaving room for compromise.
* **Focus on Value:** Bob highlights the value of the product to Alice, aiming to establish a sense of fairness.
* **Open to Compromise:** The message ends with a positive tone, indicating Bob's willingness to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which still gives you a significant savings over your own valuation.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good price, Bob can still potentially get a better deal.  He has already successfully pushed Alice down from $1,000,000 to $950,000. By continuing to negotiate, he has the opportunity to further reduce the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer.  How about $900,000?  It's a good compromise that benefits us both, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Move:**  Bob increases his offer slightly, showing he's willing to negotiate but not drastically changing his position. 
* **Focus on Compromise:** He emphasizes the ""good compromise"" aspect, highlighting the potential for a mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning ""finally closing this deal"" adds a sense of urgency and encourages Alice to accept."
