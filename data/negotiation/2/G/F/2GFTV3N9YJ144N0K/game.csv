"Alice, thanks for the offer.  That starting price is quite a bit higher than I had in mind. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair offer considering its value to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value. However, my valuation is based on factors beyond its direct use to you.  To make this work, I could come down to $1,900,000. I'm hopeful we can find a middle ground.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,900,000 is still significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay.  Perhaps we could meet in the middle - would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
