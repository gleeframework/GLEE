{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is far above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  It's in Bob's best interest to reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $18,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for this product, which is still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Lowering the price:** Bob is starting with a significant counter-offer, bringing the price down to $10,000. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still staying within his budget.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $14,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's comfort zone. Bob should keep negotiating, aiming for a price closer to his $8,000 limit.  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really serious about getting this product, but I can only go as high as $12,000. It's a fair price for both of us, considering your value for the product and my budget."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromising, but firm:** Bob compromises further by raising his offer to $12,000, demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway. However, he's still staying firm with his position, indicating this is his final offer within his budget.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer! I appreciate your flexibility. However, $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $12,000.  It's a fair price, and I believe it's the best way to close this deal today."", ""product_price"": 12000}

```

**Explanation:**

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $13,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm going to offer $12,500 as a final compromise. This is a fair price, and if we can't agree, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has reached his limit.  Alice's offer of $13,250 is still too high for him.  With only one round left, he's better off buying the product from John for $8,000. This is the best way to guarantee he gets the product within his budget and avoids further negotiation with Alice."
