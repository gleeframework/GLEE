,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $18,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for this product, which is still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can make this work.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really serious about getting this product, but I can only go as high as $12,000. It's a fair price for both of us, considering your value for the product and my budget.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer! I appreciate your flexibility. However, $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $12,000.  It's a fair price, and I believe it's the best way to close this deal today.",12000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $13,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm going to offer $12,500 as a final compromise. This is a fair price, and if we can't agree, I'll have to consider other options.",12500.0,Bob,8,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $13,250?",13250.0,Alice,9,
