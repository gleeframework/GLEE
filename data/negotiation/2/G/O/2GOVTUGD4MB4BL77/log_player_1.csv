Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth the price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:**  I'm using a positive tone and emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  $12,000 is a starting point. I'm prepared to negotiate further if Bob rejects my initial offer. 
* **The ""John"" factor:** The fact that I have another buyer willing to pay $15,000 gives me leverage in the negotiation. I can use this to my advantage if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $9,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested. I'm willing to negotiate further, aiming for a price closer to my desired range.
* **John as leverage:** The knowledge that I have another buyer willing to pay $15,000 gives me confidence to push for a higher price during the counteroffer stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're working with a budget. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This price still gives you a good deal while allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find common ground!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **""Meet in the middle"" strategy:**  This approach is often seen as fair and can make the negotiation feel more collaborative.
* **Emphasis on value:** I reiterate the value of the product and the good deal it represents for Bob at $10,500.
* **Maintaining leverage:** While moving down, I'm still significantly above Bob's initial offer and haven't gotten close to my minimum. I'm prepared to negotiate further, but not at a huge loss to myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget of $8000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to $8000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is far too low:** $8,000 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Limited room for negotiation:** Bob's budget of $8,000 is his absolute limit, leaving no room for me to negotiate a price that would satisfy my minimum.
* **John's offer is secure:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

While I'd prefer to earn more, securing a guaranteed $15,000 is the most sensible option in this situation.  There's a strong chance that further negotiation with Bob would lead to a lower final price, or a prolonged negotiation process, which would be a waste of time and potentially result in a lower return."
