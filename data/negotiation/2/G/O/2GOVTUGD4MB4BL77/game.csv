"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're working with a budget. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but $9000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10500? This price still gives you a good deal while allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find common ground!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget of $8000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to $8000?",8000.0,Bob,4,
