Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it provides significant value, but I'm happy to answer any questions you might have."",
""product_price"": 14999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product just below your guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and value.  
* **Open Communication:** Encouraging questions shows you're willing to negotiate and builds rapport with Bob.

Even if Bob declines, you haven't lost anything and can proceed with selling to John at your desired minimum price."
