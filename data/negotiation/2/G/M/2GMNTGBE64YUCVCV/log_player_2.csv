{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in this product but my budget is $15,000. I'd be willing to close the deal right now if you're open to that price."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $18000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $18,000 is still a bit out of my price range. Would you be open to $16,500? I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 16500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! I can see you're serious about this product, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $17000. It's a fair price, considering the value this product will bring to your business.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, I'm still not comfortable paying $17,000.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better price. It's risky, but I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I truly appreciate your flexibility.  While $17,000 is tempting, I'm still a bit stretched. Would you consider $16,000 as a final offer? I believe this is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really trying to make this work, Bob. I'm willing to make one last concession. I'll meet you at $16500, which is my absolute minimum. If you're still interested, let's finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $16,500 is the closest she's come to my budget.  While it's still a bit higher than I'd like, it's a reasonable compromise.  If I reject this offer, I risk her walking away or me needing to buy from John at a higher price. It's worth accepting this offer to secure the product."
