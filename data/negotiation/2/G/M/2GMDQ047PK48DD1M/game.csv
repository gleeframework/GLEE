"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $800,000. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $900,000 doesn't quite cover my costs.  How about $950,000?  That's a fair price that still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I've reviewed my budget again and would like to propose an offer of $925,000. This price respects your needs while keeping my investment within my desired range.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While it's getting closer, $925,000 still isn't quite where I need to be. How about we split the difference and go with $937,500? This way, we both get a fair deal. Let me know your thoughts!",937500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to reach an agreement.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but $930,000 isn't quite enough for me. Let's try $935,000.  This would be a great compromise and a win-win for both of us. What do you think?",935000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. After reviewing the situation once more, I believe an offer of $932,500 would be a fair compromise for both parties involved.",932500.0,Bob,8,
