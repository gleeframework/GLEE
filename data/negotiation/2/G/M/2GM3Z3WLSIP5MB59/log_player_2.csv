"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with an opportunity to acquire our premium product. This item holds significant value to me and represents a unique offering in its market. Considering its worth to you, I propose a purchase price of $12,000. This figure strikes a balance between reflecting the product's true value and making it accessible to you. I believe this is a fair offer that respects both our interests. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details or proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than its value to her, it's significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000 and John's offer.  You have a better alternative available."
