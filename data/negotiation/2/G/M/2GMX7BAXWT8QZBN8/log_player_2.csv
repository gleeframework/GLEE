Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

**Reasoning:**  While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price. I believe I can still negotiate a lower price, especially given Alice's willingness to counter-offer in the previous round."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice's offer is now within my budget, it's still slightly above my ideal price.

I believe there's still room for compromise, and it's worth pushing for a better price."

```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer again, but this time by a smaller amount. I'm showing Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to get a better price. I believe that with this offer, I can find a middle ground with Alice and reach an agreement."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice's offer is now within my budget, it's still a little higher than what I'm willing to pay. With only three rounds left, I'm going to try and get a final concession from Alice. I believe there's still a chance to close the deal at $10,000, which is my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:** This is my final offer.  I'm going all-in and offering my absolute maximum price. It's a risky move, but with only two rounds remaining, it's my best chance to secure the deal at my target price.  If Alice rejects this, I'll be forced to buy from John."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $10,100 is still higher than my target price, and with only one round remaining, there's little chance of getting her to go lower. It's better to avoid the risk of a potential counteroffer that could exceed my budget and just buy the product from John at my desired price."
