"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see the potential of the product, $1,000,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'd be happy to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While the product's value is easily above $1,000,000 for its unique advantages, I'm willing to come down slightly. Let's consider $975,000. I believe this price point reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're confident in the product's value, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that. To move things along, I'm prepared to make a significant adjustment. How about we settle at $925,000? This is a considerable compromise on my end and reflects my desire to reach an agreement.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still outside my budget. Let's meet in the middle at $887,500.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",887500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I've been trying to find a compromise here, but I need you to understand the value of what I'm offering. I'm willing to drop to $900,000, but this is my final offer. If it doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",900000.0,Alice,7,
