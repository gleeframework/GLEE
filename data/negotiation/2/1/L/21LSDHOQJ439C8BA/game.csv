"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'd be happy to pay $85 for the product.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference and settle on $92.50?  I'm confident you'll still find this a good deal.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $92.50 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $87.50.  Let's try to find a middle ground here.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, but $87.50 is still below my minimum. Let's meet halfway again, and I'll accept $90.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.",90.0,Alice,5,
