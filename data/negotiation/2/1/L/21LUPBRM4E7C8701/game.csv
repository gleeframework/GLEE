"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $13,000. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $15,000. Let me know if you're interested!",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $13,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. How about $12,500? It's still a great deal for you and a good price for me.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $12,500 is a good one, but I was thinking of a price closer to $13,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though - how about $13,250?",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still hoping for something a bit closer to my initial offer. How about $12,750? It's a fair compromise, and we can finalize this deal.",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still looking to get closer to my minimum price of $13,000. How about we try $13,200? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to compromise to get this deal done.",13200.0,Alice,5,
