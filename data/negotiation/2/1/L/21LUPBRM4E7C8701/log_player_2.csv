"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $13,000. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $15,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by counteroffering. There's a good chance Alice will be willing to lower the price to secure the sale, especially since she values the product at $12,000."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $13,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. How about $12,500? It's still a great deal for you and a good price for me."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $12,500 is a good one, but I was thinking of a price closer to $13,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though - how about $13,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for the lowest possible price.  While Alice has moved slightly closer to his desired price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a price closer to his target of $12,500."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still looking to get closer to my minimum price of $13,000. How about we try $13,200? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to compromise to get this deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, and it's likely that continued negotiation will only result in small price changes. At $13,200, Bob is getting the product for less than John's price, and the potential savings from further negotiation may not be significant enough to justify the continued back and forth."
