Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but not so high as to be immediately rejected. 

I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and consider whether it's worth continuing negotiations or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I am happy to sell for $80, I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I will counter Bob's offer and see if he is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering $90. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still higher than my minimum acceptable price, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $85 is closer to my desired price and  only $5 less than my previous counteroffer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I'd rather sell to Bob than go through more rounds of negotiation or sell to John for $80."
