Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $80. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $80 is significantly less than what I'm willing to part with. Let's meet in the middle - how about $140?"", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still out of my price range. I'm firm on my $80 offer. If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to look elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is clearly unwilling to budge from his $80 offer.  It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed $150."
