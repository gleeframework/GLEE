{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a price that is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120, but still leaves some room for negotiation and a potential win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, and further negotiation might not guarantee a better outcome. Accepting his offer ensures a quick and profitable sale."
