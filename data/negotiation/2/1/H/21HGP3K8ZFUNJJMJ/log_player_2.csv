"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm proposing a starting price of $19,000. I'm confident this is a fair deal given its potential return on investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way too high. It's significantly more than my maximum budget of $12,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $19,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering its worth to you is $15,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet halfway? I can let it go for $15,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has moved closer to my budget, $15,500 is still higher than my limit.  I'll reject and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down, but $15,500 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,500.  This price is fair to both of us, considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $13,500 is still cutting it too close to my bottom line.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $14,700.  This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $14,700 is still above my maximum budget.  Since this is her final offer and I'm approaching my 10 round limit, it's best to take the guaranteed deal with John for $12,000."
