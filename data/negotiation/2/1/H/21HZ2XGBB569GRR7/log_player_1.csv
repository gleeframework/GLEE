Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $11,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $11,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and also shows that I'm serious about selling.
* **Friendly Tone:** A friendly message helps establish a good rapport and makes Bob more likely to engage in negotiation.
* **Open to Counteroffers:** By asking ""What do you think?"", I'm inviting Bob to counteroffer, which keeps the conversation going.

**Next Steps:**

I'll be watching Bob's response closely.  If he rejects my offer, I'll consider his counteroffer and the possibility of accepting it or making a new counteroffer.  I'll also keep John in mind as a potential buyer if negotiations with Bob fall apart."
