Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal, but I'm willing to part with it for $120. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more.  
* **Reasonable Markup:** Starting with a $120 offer leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle but still ensures a profit above my minimum. 
* **Confident Language:**  The message aims to pique Bob's interest by highlighting the product's value while still presenting the offer as a potential bargain. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. There are many valid approaches depending on how much risk I'm willing to take and how I perceive Bob's negotiation style."
