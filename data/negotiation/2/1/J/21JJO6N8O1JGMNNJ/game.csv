"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a great price, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm ready to make a deal for $8,500.  This price reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's fair for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",9500.0,Alice,3,
