Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $9,250.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been diligently trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice. However, Alice's offer of $9,250 is still above Bob's desired price point.  Given that John is offering the product for $8,000, it's now more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John and save $1,250."
