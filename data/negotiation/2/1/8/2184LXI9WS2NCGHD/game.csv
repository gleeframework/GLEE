"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what I could get elsewhere. I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable, and I'm open to discussing this further. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your interest in the product. While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still significantly below what I need to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to benefit from a successful transaction.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's the maximum I can afford. I'm really interested in the product, so I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $950,000 just doesn't cover the value of this product for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession and offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer and is the absolute lowest I can go. It's a fair price that allows you to acquire a valuable asset while giving me a return that makes this deal worthwhile.  Let's close this deal and make it happen.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
