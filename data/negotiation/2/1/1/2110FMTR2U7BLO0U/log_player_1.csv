{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product at a price that reflects its value. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. My initial offer is $1,150,000.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm confident I can get a better price through continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but it's a bit lower than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, acknowledging your interest in the product. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'd like to meet you in the middle at $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  The negotiation is becoming increasingly tense, and I risk losing the deal by being too inflexible. However, I believe with another counteroffer, I can secure a better price and maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with your latest offer. Given the unique value of this product, I'm prepared to offer it to you for $1,050,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I hope we can reach an agreement. It's important to me that this deal benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not at a comfortable price. I'd like to meet you at $975,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product's value to me, and it's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is now significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, and further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a better result. It's becoming increasingly likely that we won't reach an agreement, and I'm running out of time.  Selling to John at $1,000,000 guarantees me my minimum desired profit, avoiding the risk of losing the deal entirely."
