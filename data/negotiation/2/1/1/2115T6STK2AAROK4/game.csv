"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2,000,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. Thank you for considering my proposal.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
