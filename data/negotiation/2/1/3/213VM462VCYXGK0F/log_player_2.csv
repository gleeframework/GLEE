# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  You're willing to pay a maximum of $8,000, and Alice is offering it for $12,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,500 is closer to your budget, you're still $2,500 over your limit. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice before going with John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is still a bit high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $10,000. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:

```

Alice is now offering $10,000, which is still $2,000 over your limit.  While you could keep negotiating, there's no guarantee she'll come down further. It's better to go with John and save the time and hassle of further negotiation."
