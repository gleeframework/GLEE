Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above my minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation and potential profit.  I'm hoping to strike a deal with Bob, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'd like to get for the product. I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,250. Can we agree on that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $12,250 is a fair compromise.  It's above my minimum acceptable price and selling to John would only get me $10,000.  I'll accept Bob's offer and move on."
