"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $800,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to get a better price.  I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for some profit on your end. Let's see if we can find common ground.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $600,000. Considering the product's value to you and the market demand, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $750,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true value, while also being more competitive than my initial offer. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $750,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $600,000.  This is a fair price for both of us and allows for a reasonable profit on your end.  Let's work together to reach a deal.",600000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm proposing a price of $700,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to finalize the deal. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,5,
