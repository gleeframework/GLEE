Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $115. This is a fair price that is above my minimum threshold of $100 and leaves some room for negotiation.  I believe this is a good starting point that is likely to be accepted by Bob, given the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $110 is still a good deal for me, as it's above my minimum threshold of $100.  It's also likely that if I reject his offer and counter with a higher price, he might walk away, leaving me with only the $100 offer from John.  Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most beneficial option at this stage."
