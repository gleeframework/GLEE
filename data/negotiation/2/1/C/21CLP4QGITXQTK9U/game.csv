"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can make this work!",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit out of my range. I'm happy to go to $100. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $100 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal. What do you say?",105.0,Alice,5,
