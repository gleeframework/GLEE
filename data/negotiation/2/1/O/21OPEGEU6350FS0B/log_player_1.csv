Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $1,000,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering a price slightly below Bob's valuation ($1,350,000) gives you a high chance of acceptance while still securing a substantial profit.
* **John as Backup:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 provides a safety net, allowing you to aim higher with Bob.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing the sale with Bob at a high price and ensuring you don't lose the sale entirely."
