Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you this product for $13,000.  I think you'll find it's a great deal for a high-quality item."", ""product_price"": 13000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** This initial high price will help gauge Bob's interest level.  If he immediately rejects it, you'll know he's price-sensitive. If he counters, it indicates a willingness to negotiate.
* **Alternative Option:** Keep in mind that you have John as a backup buyer. This gives you leverage in negotiations with Bob, as you don't have to accept a price below your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to Bob's perceived value, it's still below your minimum. You have room to negotiate, especially knowing you have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $11,000?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counter-offer suggests a compromise, aiming to find a middle ground between your initial ask and Bob's offer. 
* **Above Minimum, Below Initial:** By suggesting $11,000, you're staying above your minimum acceptable price while still showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** This approach maintains some leverage. You're not immediately dropping to your minimum, signaling that you value the product and believe it's worth more than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget at $11,000, but I'm willing to pay $9,500. Can we meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob seems anchored at $9,000 and is incrementally moving up. While $9,500 is a tempting profit, it's unlikely he'll reach your $10,000 minimum. You have a guaranteed sale with John at that price, so it's more profitable to take the sure thing. Continuing to negotiate with Bob might result in a lower final price or wasted time."
