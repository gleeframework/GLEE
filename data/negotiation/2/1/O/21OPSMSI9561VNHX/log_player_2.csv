"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product for $125 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $125.** This is lower than the $150 you'd pay John.
* **You want to save money.** Accepting Alice's offer saves you $25 compared to buying from John. 
* **Even though you value the product at $150, getting it for $125 is a good deal.**"
