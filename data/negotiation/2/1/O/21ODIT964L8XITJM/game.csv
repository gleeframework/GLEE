"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $65 is too far below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and go with $80? That way, we both get a fair price, and I can avoid the hassle of selling to someone else.  What do you say?",80.0,Alice,5,
