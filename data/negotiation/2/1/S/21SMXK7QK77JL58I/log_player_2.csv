"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $90. I believe it will be highly valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $100. Rejecting the offer gives Bob the opportunity to negotiate with Alice further or potentially find another seller with a lower price."
