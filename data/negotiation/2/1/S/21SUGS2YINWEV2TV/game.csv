"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not comfortable going above that price. I'm looking to save some money on this purchase.",1200000.0,Bob,2,,

"Bob, I understand your desire to save on this purchase, and I value your interest. However, the product's worth significantly exceeds that figure. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This represents a significant reduction on my part while still reflecting the true value of what's being offered.",1450000.0,Alice,3,,
