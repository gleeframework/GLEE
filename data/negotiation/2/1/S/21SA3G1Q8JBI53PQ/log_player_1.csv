**Reasoning:** We are getting closer, but I'm still holding out for a higher price. Bob is moving closer to my desired range, and I'm willing to negotiate a bit further.  John's offer is my safety net."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer.  I can do $825,000.  It's a fair price, and I'm hoping we can close this deal.

**Reasoning:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob has indicated this is his final offer. Accepting $825,000 is a good outcome compared to risking further negotiation where he might not budge or walking away and taking John's $1,000,000 offer."
