"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its high quality and functionality, it's valued at $150 by me. Considering its worth to you might be around $100, I'm extending this opportunity to purchase it for $120. This price not only ensures a fair deal for both of us but also allows me to maintain profitability on my investment. Looking forward to your positive response! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.

Alice's offer is $120, but you can get the same product from John for $100. It's better to save the $20 and buy from John."
