# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $15,000. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a bit. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, $7,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $12,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a significant drop from my original price.  Let's find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $11,000.  To maximize savings and stay within budget, buying from John for $10,000 is the best option now."
