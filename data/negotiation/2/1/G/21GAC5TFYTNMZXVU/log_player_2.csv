Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $650,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise. However, we need to bridge a significant gap in our valuations.  To be entirely transparent, this product holds substantial value for me, and I have another potential buyer at a higher price point.  Therefore, my final offer is $850,000. This represents a significant concession on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has drawn a line in the sand. She's introduced the pressure of another buyer and given her ""final offer.""  While $850,000 is getting closer, it's not worth the risk of pushing further. You have a guaranteed option with John at $800,000. It's time to take the sure win and save the $50,000."
