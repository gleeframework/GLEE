"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential for significant returns on your investment."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Beginning with a price significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value provides room for negotiation and signals the product's importance. 
* **Justification:** Framing the price in terms of ""potential"" and ""returns on investment"" focuses on value rather than just the upfront cost.
* **Leaving Room:** This offer allows for potential counteroffers from Bob while still keeping the price well above your minimum acceptable amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, that price is simply too high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $1,300,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While it's closer to what he values the product at, I have room to negotiate. I'm confident I can get a better deal by countering and keeping the negotiation going, at least for another round or two."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've considered your proposal, and while I recognize you're making a serious offer, I believe the product's inherent value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This adjustment reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession by dropping $350,000 from my initial asking price. This demonstrates flexibility and a desire to reach a deal.
* **Holding Firm:** Despite the concession, my counteroffer is still significantly higher than both Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for further negotiation while signaling that I'm not willing to settle for a lowball offer.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm framing the counteroffer positively, emphasizing a ""mutually beneficial agreement"" and highlighting my efforts to find common ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,450,000, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit Reached:** Bob explicitly stated that $1,450,000 is his highest offer.  It's unlikely further negotiation will significantly bridge the gap between his offer and my $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** John represents a guaranteed sale at my desired minimum price. 
* **Time Savings:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of reaching an impasse and wasting valuable time. Accepting John's offer provides a clean and immediate resolution."
