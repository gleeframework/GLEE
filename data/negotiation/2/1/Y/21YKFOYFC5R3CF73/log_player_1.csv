Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, at the price I value the product. This is a negotiation, and Bob knows the product is worth less to him. By starting high, I establish a strong starting point and leave room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to counter, but for now, I'm holding firm on my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is a good offer, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my value.  This counteroffer is a compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.  If Bob accepts, it's a good deal. If he rejects, I'll see how he responds before considering my backup option of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's very close and I'm satisfied with the outcome. It's important to remember that time is money, and continuing to negotiate with Bob could potentially lead to him walking away entirely.  This offer guarantees me a sale and minimizes the risk of losing a deal altogether."
