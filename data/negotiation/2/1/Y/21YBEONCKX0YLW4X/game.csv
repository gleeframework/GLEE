"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  That said, $1,100,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. This product offers significant value, and to be fair to both of us, I propose a price of $1,950,000. I believe this reflects its true worth.",1950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value proposition, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Could we meet somewhere around $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,350,000 is closer to what I envisioned, I'm still seeking a higher price.  Would you consider $1,725,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1725000.0,Alice,5,
