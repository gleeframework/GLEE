"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good starting point, Bob can likely get a better price.  He has a significant budget advantage and should aim to push Alice lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has significant value to you. Considering your offer of $850,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit, $900,000 is still too high for Bob. He has room to negotiate further, and it's worth pushing for a lower price to maximize his savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $875,000, which is closer to our previous offer and a good compromise.  Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm still not quite comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to make another concession. Considering your offer of $875,000, I'm proposing a counteroffer of $885,000. I think this is a fair compromise that takes into account the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has a significant budget advantage and has already gotten the price down considerably. While there's still room to negotiate, accepting this offer would result in a significant saving compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation is risky, as Alice might be less willing to budge, and Bob could end up with a worse deal or run out of time."
