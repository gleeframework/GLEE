"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a great product that I think you'd really love! I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly and enthusiastic tone can encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message makes it clear I'm open to discussing the price, which could lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:** While $120 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not desperate to sell at that price. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** Bob's interest suggests he values the product.  By rejecting his offer, I can try to get closer to my desired price.
* **Negotiation is Ongoing:**  Rejecting his offer doesn't mean the deal is off.  I can counter with a price closer to $150,  leaving room for further negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $120 is just a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $135?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate but not giving up on my desired profit.
* **Reasonable Counteroffer:**  $135 is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. 
* **Positive and Collaborative Tone:** The message emphasizes fairness and finding a solution that works for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $135 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $125 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While $125 is only $5 away from my minimum, I still see the potential for a better price. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate. Rejecting his offer keeps the pressure on him to improve his offer. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John for $120 guarantees a sale but doesn't maximize potential profits.  There's still a chance to get closer to $135."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $125 is closer to where I need to be, but I'm still a little ways off.  Let's split the difference - $130 would be a good compromise for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimizing Loss:** I'm willing to lower my price slightly, but not by much. This shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a good price.
* **Fair Compromise:**  $130 is exactly halfway between my last offer and Bob's current offer. This makes it seem like a fair and reasonable compromise.
* **Encouraging Finality:** The message implies that I'm getting closer to my limit and that this could be the final offer. This puts some pressure on Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $127 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  $127 is only $3 away from my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Limited Upside:**  We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  It's unlikely Bob will budge much further.
* **Guarantee a Sale:**  Accepting this offer guarantees a sale and a profit above my minimum. 

While I'd prefer to get closer to $130, the risk of losing the deal entirely to Bob or having to sell to John for $120 is not worth it. Accepting this offer ensures a reasonably good outcome."
