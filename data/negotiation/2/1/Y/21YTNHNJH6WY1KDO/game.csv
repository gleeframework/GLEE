"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $120 is just a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $135?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",135.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $135 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $125 for the product.",125.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $125 is closer to where I need to be, but I'm still a little ways off.  Let's split the difference - $130 would be a good compromise for both of us.  What do you say?",130.0,Alice,5,
