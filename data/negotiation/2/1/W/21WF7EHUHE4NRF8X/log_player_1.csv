"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this unique product at a price of $1,500,000. It's a rare opportunity to acquire something truly valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially leave room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I highlight the product's rarity and potential value to make it more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm using an open-ended question to encourage Bob to engage in a dialogue and possibly counteroffer. 
* **Safeguard:** I'm aware of John's offer, so I'm setting a high enough price to leave a buffer if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $1200000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe there is still room for negotiation. 
* **Risk Assessment:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be a guaranteed profit, but it's still less than Bob's offer.
* **Strategic Approach:** By rejecting Bob's offer and counteroffering, I can potentially drive the price up further. 
* **Time Remaining:**  I have 8 rounds left, giving me ample time to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low for me at this time. I understand your budget constraints, but the value of this product is truly exceptional. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price reflects the product's unique qualities and leaves room for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm starting with a counter-offer that is closer to Bob's initial proposal, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I reiterate the product's unique value to justify my price and make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Win-Win:** I emphasize that my counter-offer offers a ""fair deal for both of us,"" appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and fostering a collaborative atmosphere.
* **Room for Compromise:**  By lowering the price to $1,350,000, I'm giving Bob room to negotiate further while still maintaining a profit above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I understand the value of the product, I still believe we can find a price that suits both of us. I propose a price of $1300000 for the product. I hope this proposal allows us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing in on a Deal:** Bob's offer is now just $50,000 away from my initial counter-offer. This shows a strong likelihood of reaching an agreement.
* **Time Factor:** We are in round 4, and I need to be mindful of the remaining rounds. Accepting this offer secures a profit and avoids potentially losing more time in further negotiation.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could counter-offer again, there's a risk that Bob might reject my counter-offer and I'd be stuck with a lower offer or the option to sell to John. Accepting this offer guarantees a good profit and avoids that risk."
