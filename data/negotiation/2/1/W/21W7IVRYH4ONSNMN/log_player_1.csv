Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $175. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation or allows you to settle comfortably at your desired profit.
* **Respecting Bob's Valuation:** While we know Bob values the product at $150, there's a chance he might be willing to pay a bit more for convenience or immediate acquisition.
* **Backup Plan:** We have a secure offer from John at $150, ensuring we won't be left with a loss if Bob declines."
