"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, as it's worth significantly more to me. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd rather sell it to you if possible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $12,000 from John.  Rejecting this offer gives you the opportunity to secure a better price."
