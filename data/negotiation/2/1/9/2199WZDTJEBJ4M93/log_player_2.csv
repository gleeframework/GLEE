"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product. Considering its value, I'm proposing an initial price of $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a better price than John's $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $9,500 is a fair offer, the value of this product to you is undeniable. How about we meet halfway and settle on $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,250 is still a good deal for Bob. It's less than John's price of $12,000 and closer to Bob's desired price.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer and he'll end up paying John's higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer is the safest option to secure the product at a reasonable price."
