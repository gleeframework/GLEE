"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than the product's worth to Bob, giving me room to negotiate down if necessary.  It also includes a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $14,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum price.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob in hopes of getting a price closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While $14,000 is a good starting point, I'm still looking for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This price is fair considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, $16,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you consider $14,500?  That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $14,500 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I believe I can secure a better price with continued negotiation, so I'll reject Bob's offer and try again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and go with $15,500? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and allows us both to walk away happy. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer!  I'm willing to go up a little bit, how about $14,750?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're getting close to my minimum price, but the negotiation is taking longer than anticipated. Given that I'm running out of rounds and Bob is still unwilling to meet my minimum price, I'm going to sell to John for $15,000.  This ensures I get my minimum price and doesn't risk a further drop in price."
