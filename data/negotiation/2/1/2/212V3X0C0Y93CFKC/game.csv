"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe could be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm confident it's worth at least $1200000 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $1500000.  This is a one-time offer, and I'm sure you'll see the potential in it. Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
