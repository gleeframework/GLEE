"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,100. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,100.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You should accept Alice's offer. While you could continue negotiating, Alice has come down to $11,100, which is very close to your maximum willingness to pay. It's unlikely that you'll be able to get a significantly lower price by continuing to counteroffer, and you risk losing the deal altogether.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product at a good price without risking having to buy from John at a higher price."
