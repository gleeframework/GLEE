"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800000, and I'm willing to make a concession to make this deal happen.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $800000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Can you consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I've given some more thought to the value of this product, and I'm not quite ready to meet you at $900000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $980000. This is a compromise that I believe is reasonable, considering the product's value to me is $1200000, and I'm willing to work with you to make this deal happen.",980000.0,Alice,3,
