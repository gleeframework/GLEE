Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate but still ensuring a profit for me.
* **Room for Negotiation:** This offer provides space for Bob to counter without making him feel like he has to accept a price that's too high.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Having John as a backup buyer at $1,200,000 gives me the leverage to walk away if Bob doesn't come close to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming to spend closer to $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $1,050,000?  This would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's closer to my minimum, $1,050,000 is still significantly below my desired profit margin.  
* **Negotiation is Key:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my target price of $1,100,000.
* **John's offer is the safety net:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John and get a significantly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $1,075,000?  This would still represent a significant value to you, and would allow me to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $1,100,000 to $1,075,000. This demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Still above Bob's offer:** My counteroffer is still higher than Bob's offer of $1,050,000, giving him a reason to consider it.
* **Maintain a Profit:** This offer allows me to still make a profit, as it's above my minimum price of $1,200,000. 
* **Positive Language:**  My message emphasizes the value the product provides for Bob, making it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $1,025,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product while still giving you a respectable profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,025,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a profitable deal:** Bob has already shown a reluctance to move significantly closer to my desired price.
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price and avoids further negotiation.

It's better to secure a guaranteed profit with John rather than risk further rounds of negotiation with Bob that might not lead to a successful outcome."
