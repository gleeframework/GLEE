"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly less than what it's worth to me. Could you consider something closer to $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $17,000 is still a bit steep for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $11,000. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be honest, $15,000 is the absolute lowest I can go to make this worthwhile for me.  I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value it will bring you.  What do you say?",15000.0,Alice,5,
