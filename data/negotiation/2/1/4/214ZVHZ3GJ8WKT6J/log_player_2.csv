"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better for you:** You are willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice is offering it for $12,000. This saves you $3,000.
* **Buying from John is more expensive:** John is selling the product for $15,000, which is your maximum price, but Alice's offer is lower. 

It's always beneficial to accept a lower price when available."
