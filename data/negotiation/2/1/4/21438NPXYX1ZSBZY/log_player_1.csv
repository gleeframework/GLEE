"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What do you think?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum price.  I need to negotiate higher.

```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This is my final offer."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Could we meet halfway at $1,200,000? This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","This is a tricky situation. Bob is now matching my minimum acceptable price, but he's calling it his ""final offer"".  There's a chance I could push for more, but also a risk he walks away. 

```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I could try to squeeze a little more out of the deal, accepting ensures I get my minimum and don't risk losing the sale to John."
