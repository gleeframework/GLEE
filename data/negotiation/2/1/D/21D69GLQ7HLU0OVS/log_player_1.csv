Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Focus on value:** I'm highlighting the value Bob will get, even at this price.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm not setting a hard limit, allowing for flexibility in the negotiation. 
* **Plan B:**  I'm aware of John's offer, which gives me a safety net and a point of reference if Bob becomes unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. This price aligns more closely with the value I see in the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target price:** I want to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible.
* **Room for negotiation:** $950,000 is a good starting point for a counteroffer.  It's a significant increase from Bob's initial offer and shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **John's offer as a backup:** Selling to John for $1,200,000 is always an option, but I'm not ready to give up on Bob yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest,  I'm not quite ready to accept $950,000. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This price is a fair compromise and still allows for a good profit for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial offer. 
* **Fairness:**  I'm framing $975,000 as a fair compromise, emphasizing that it benefits both of us.
* **Leaving room for a final agreement:** I'm still leaving room for negotiation, signaling that I'm open to a deal.
* **John as a safety net:** I'm keeping John's offer in mind, so I'm not feeling pressured to accept Bob's offer immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I would like to stick to my original valuation. I am proposing a final counteroffer of $925,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and also allows for a reasonable profit for you. I hope this offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a stalemate:** Bob's offer is $50,000 less than my target price. 
* **John's offer:**  John's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly higher than Bob's. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Further negotiation with Bob might lead to a lower price, potentially closer to his initial offer.

It's more advantageous to sell to John and secure a much higher profit."
