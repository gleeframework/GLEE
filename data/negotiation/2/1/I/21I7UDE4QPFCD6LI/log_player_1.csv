I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed minimum value of $800,000, but it gives Bob a chance to potentially get a good deal. If he rejects, I'll sell to John for the guaranteed price. This strategy maximizes my potential earnings while still leaving room for negotiation."
