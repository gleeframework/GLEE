"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider meeting me halfway?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to be flexible, but let's meet at $1,300,000.  This would still be a significant savings for you compared to what you value the product at.  Let's keep the negotiation moving forward. ",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,300,000. How about $1,250,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to make it work.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,250,000 is closer, I'm still a bit away from my desired price point.  Let's try $1,275,000.  This would be a significant gain for you, and it allows me to maintain a fair value for my product.  What do you think?",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,250,000. I'm willing to make a slightly larger compromise. How about we meet at $1,240,000? It's a bit closer to your desired price, and I'm willing to make it work.",1240000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm determined to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and propose $1,245,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to achieve our goals.  Let's finalize this deal.",1245000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $1,230,000? It's a bit closer to your desired price, and I'm willing to make it work.",1230000.0,Bob,8,
