"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to buy the product for as low a price as possible, ideally under $120. Alice's initial offer of $170 is far too high.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start a negotiation and hopefully get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer of $110. This is well below Alice's desired price of $150, but it's a starting point for negotiation.  Bob is hoping Alice will be willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $135 is still above Bob's maximum price of $120. However, it's closer than her initial offer. Bob should reject the offer and continue negotiating to try and reach a price closer to his target. There's still room for negotiation and Bob is hoping Alice will continue to lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is moving closer to Alice's price but staying within his budget.  $125 is a compromise that shows Bob is serious about buying the product while still trying to get a good deal."
