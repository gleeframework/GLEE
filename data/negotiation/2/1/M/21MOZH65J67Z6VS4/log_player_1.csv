"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common negotiation tactic to leave room for bargaining. I'm confident that Bob will counteroffer, and we can work our way down to a price that's mutually agreeable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but still keeping it above Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also trying to secure a price closer to my minimum acceptable value. I believe this is a reasonable counteroffer that Bob might accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is now very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $150, I'm running out of rounds.  Accepting this offer ensures I get a decent profit and avoids the risk of ending up with nothing if I keep rejecting offers."
