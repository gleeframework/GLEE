"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I believe you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great price, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I think $950,000 is a bit steep. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you think $950,000 is steep, but I have to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least $900,000 to make it worth my while. How about we discuss $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, $875,000 is a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about $750,000? I feel that's a fair offer.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $825,000? That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm willing to meet you closer to your price. Would you consider $780,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me closer to my price. I'm willing to consider $810,000, which is a compromise between our last two offers. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",810000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I'm willing to offer $790,000 to finalize the deal.  This leaves some room for you to make a decent profit, and I get the product I need. What do you say?",790000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I think we're really close now. I'm willing to meet you at $815,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. If you're willing to go this high, I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",815000.0,Alice,9,
