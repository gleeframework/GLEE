{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's below my minimum value but significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a decent profit. I'm also framing it as a great deal to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know if that's something you can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is more than the product is worth to Bob, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000.  I'm going to try and get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can finalize a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$9,500 is still too far below my minimum value of $15,000. I will try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make one final compromise.  I'm willing to lower the price to $11,000.  This is a fair offer that allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 11000}
