"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I think $1,000,000 is a little high. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm eager to hear your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $700,000? I believe that's a fair offer reflecting both the product's value and my budget.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with $700,000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm offering $850,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I hope you'll consider it.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your counteroffers. How about we settle on $750,000? I'm willing to finalize the deal at that price.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $750,000. I've been flexible, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good return on my investment. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $800,000. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",800000.0,Alice,7,
