"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed to meet high standards. This exceptional item comes with a variety of features that cater to diverse needs. I believe its value exceeds $80, but I'm open to discussing the price. Let's aim for a fair deal that reflects the quality and utility it offers. What do you think about starting at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good price, you can potentially do better.  You have a fallback option with John at $150, so there's room to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you've put into this product. However, $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
