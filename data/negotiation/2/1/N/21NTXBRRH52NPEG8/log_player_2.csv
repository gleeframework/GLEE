"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high. It's  above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer sets your maximum budget as the starting point. Since you have 10 rounds, it's worth trying to see if Alice will be willing to come down to your price. It's a strong opening counteroffer that sets the stage for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above your ideal price point. It's worth continuing the negotiation to try and get closer to $1,000,000.  There are still multiple rounds left, and continuing to reject offers might push Alice to offer a price that's more acceptable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, this counteroffer represents a reasonable compromise between the two previous offers. By offering a price midway between $1,000,000 and $1,750,000, you're demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway while still staying within your budget constraints. This approach increases the chances of a successful negotiation in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to $1,600,000, we're still above our ideal price point. With 5 rounds remaining, there's still room for further negotiation. We've shown that we are willing to meet halfway, and there's a chance Alice might be willing to come down further.  The risk of continuing is that we might end up buying from John, but the potential reward of a lower price makes continuing a better choice at this point."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1375000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer further splits the difference between the current offer of $1,600,000 and our previous counteroffer of $1,250,000. By continuing to offer slightly higher prices, we show Alice we are serious about getting a deal done, but also that we are not willing to overpay. This approach increases the likelihood of getting a deal in the remaining rounds, while minimizing the risk of ending up with John's higher price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down again, we're still $550,000 above our ideal price. We have three rounds left.  We've been successful in bringing down the price significantly.  With a few more rounds of negotiation, there's a good chance we can get to a more acceptable price, especially since we've demonstrated a willingness to compromise.  There's still a chance we might end up buying from John, but the risk is outweighed by the potential reward of a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are getting closer to our goal price, but we still have room to negotiate.  Alice has lowered her price several times, showing a willingness to compromise. Offering $1,450,000 signals our commitment to reaching an agreement while staying within our budget.  With only two rounds left, we are pushing to close the deal at a favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While this offer is closer to our ideal price than John's offer, we still have one round left and the potential to save even more money.  The risk of buying from John is still present, but we've shown a willingness to compromise and there's a good chance Alice will come down further, especially since we're in the final round.  It's worth risking a bit to see if we can secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 10
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is our final offer, and we're pushing for a price that's just a bit higher than our ideal price but still significantly lower than John's offer. It's a high-risk, high-reward move. If Alice accepts, we'll get a great deal. If she rejects, we'll have to buy from John.  At this point, we've demonstrated our commitment to getting a deal done, and we're giving Alice one last chance to meet us halfway."
