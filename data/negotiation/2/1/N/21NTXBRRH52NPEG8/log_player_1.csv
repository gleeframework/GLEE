"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation. It's important to try and gauge Bob's interest and how high he's willing to go. If he rejects, I'll need to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly less than my minimum. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,750,000. This is a compromise,  showing I'm willing to negotiate but still leaving room for further discussion. I'm trying to find a price that's attractive to Bob but also fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum threshold. I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,600,000. This is another compromise, demonstrating my flexibility.  Since Bob's offers seem to be increasing, I'm hoping this will be closer to what he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum threshold. I'm not willing to settle for less than $1,500,000 at this point. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm making a final attempt to get a price closer to my minimum. With only a few rounds left, I'm lowering my offer to $1,550,000. This is a significant concession, but I'm hoping it's enough to convince Bob to make a deal. If he rejects this, I'll have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price.  While $1,450,000 is tempting, I'm hoping I can get closer to my minimum with one more round. If Bob rejects my next offer, I'll likely have to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is my final offer.  I'm willing to accept my minimum price of $1,500,000.  If Bob rejects this, I'll sell the product to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's time to move on.  Bob is clearly not willing to meet my minimum price, and I only have one round left.  I'll take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John rather than risk getting nothing from Bob."
