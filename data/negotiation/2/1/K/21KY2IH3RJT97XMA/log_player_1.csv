{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be worth the investment.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point higher than Bob's perceived value, aiming to leave room for bargaining. It's important to be confident and friendly in the message to create a positive atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe I can't justify the price of $14,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $12,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is exactly the minimum I'm willing to accept, and it avoids further negotiation. Accepting his offer is the most efficient way to secure the sale."
