{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is significantly higher than my minimum desired price of $800,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges the higher value the product holds for Bob. By starting at a high price and communicating the value proposition, I aim to maximize my earnings while leaving room for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I am willing to pay up to $1000000 for the product. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum price of $800,000, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer and the product's true value to him. I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a mutually beneficial price. I'll counteroffer and attempt to secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, reflecting both the value of the product and your budget. I hope this is a compromise we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I am willing to pay $950000 for it. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is lower than my initial goal, it's still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 and the price John is offering.  It's important to remember that negotiation is about finding a win-win solution.  Accepting this offer ensures a decent profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation that could result in a lower offer or the need to sell to John."
