"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. It's a significant discount from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob will see the value in this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not willing to sell for that price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $13,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise, while still ensuring I get a fair price. Hopefully, we can reach an agreement in this round."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,500 is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still not ready to settle. I'm going to counteroffer one more time. If Bob rejects again, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}

This is my final offer.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is very close to my minimum.  If Bob rejects this, I'm going to sell to John."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached my limit. Bob is clearly not willing to meet my minimum price, and I've already made significant concessions.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $15,000.  It's not my ideal outcome, but it's still a profitable sale."
