"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product of exceptional value.  Given its unique benefits, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this price better reflects the value I'm willing to pay for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me to consider. This product offers you substantial value, worth far more than your initial offer reflects.  I'm willing to meet you halfway – how about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the product has value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. However, the value this product brings to your specific needs is substantial.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,275,000. This reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $1,275,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,225,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, and I want to make this work for both of us.  Let's split the difference - $1,250,000, and we have an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your position, but I also have a bottom line.  I'm willing to accept $1,230,000 –  a final offer demonstrating my sincere desire to see this deal through. This product has immense potential for you, and I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment.",1230000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to go above $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so how about $1,215,000?",1215000.0,Bob,10,
