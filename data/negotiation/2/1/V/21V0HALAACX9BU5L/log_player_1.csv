"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product of exceptional value.  Given its unique benefits, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're aiming high to maximize potential profit.  While $1,500,000 is Bob's maximum, starting closer to that figure gives us room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The initial offer leaves $100,000 for potential negotiation, allowing Bob to feel like he's getting a deal while still exceeding our minimum.
* **Confident Tone:** The message projects confidence in the product's value, subtly reinforcing the high price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this price better reflects the value I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is significantly below our target and leaves a substantial amount of potential profit on the table. While it's higher than our absolute minimum, we are still early in the negotiation. We have room to counter and try to bring the price closer to our desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me to consider. This product offers you substantial value, worth far more than your initial offer reflects.  I'm willing to meet you halfway – how about $1,300,000?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection with Justification:** We're firmly rejecting Bob's offer without completely shutting down the negotiation. Explaining that his offer is too low emphasizes our position. 
* **Concession:** By offering a compromise and meeting Bob halfway, we're demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a strong profit.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message reiterates the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits and justifying the higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product has value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're making progress, but $1,250,000 is still a significant distance from our starting point. Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, indicating he's willing to negotiate. We have ample rounds left to counter, and walking away with $1,250,000 now would leave a substantial amount of potential profit unrealized."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. However, the value this product brings to your specific needs is substantial.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,275,000. This reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:** We start by acknowledging Bob's movement on price, building goodwill and showing we are engaged in the negotiation. 
* **Reiterating Value:** By specifically linking the product's value to *Bob's needs*, we remind him of its unique benefits and justify the higher price.
* **Smaller Concession:** We are making a smaller concession this round ($25,000 instead of $50,000), signaling that we are getting closer to our bottom line.
* **Seeking Agreement:**  The tone remains collaborative. We aim to find a solution that works for both parties, increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $1,275,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,225,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're now past the halfway point in the negotiation, and Bob is still attempting to make relatively low jumps in his offers. While $1,225,000 is a tempting profit, we need to hold firm to secure a better deal. Accepting at this stage might signal that we're willing to settle for less than our target.  We still have a few rounds to nudge him closer to our desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I understand you're looking for the best possible deal, and I want to make this work for both of us.  Let's split the difference - $1,250,000, and we have an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency and Compromise:** We've entered the later stages of the negotiation, and it's time to create a sense of urgency while offering a compelling compromise. Splitting the difference between his last offer and our previous offer shows flexibility and a desire to close the deal.
* **Finality:**  The language ""we have an agreement"" implies this is our final offer, encouraging Bob to accept rather than risk losing the deal.
* **Profitable Outcome:** While not our ideal price, $1,250,000 is a strong profit margin that significantly exceeds our backup offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a critical point in the negotiation. Bob has presented his ""final offer"", creating a sense of urgency. However, his offer of $1,200,000 is still below our last compromise, signaling he may have more room to move. By rejecting this offer, we communicate that we are serious about a higher price and are willing to risk the deal to achieve it. We still have two rounds left to reach an agreement closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I respect your position, but I also have a bottom line.  I'm willing to accept $1,230,000 –  a final offer demonstrating my sincere desire to see this deal through. This product has immense potential for you, and I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment."", ""product_price"": 1230000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We're drawing a line in the sand with a firm ""final offer"" while still showing a willingness to negotiate. This signals seriousness and prevents the negotiation from stalling. 
* **Slight Concession:** We meet Bob halfway between his last offer ($1,200,000) and our previous offer ($1,250,000), creating an appealing compromise.
* **Value Focus:** The message ends by reiterating the product's value to Bob, subtly reinforcing the price. 
* **Time Pressure:** With only one round remaining after this, Bob is under pressure to accept this final offer or risk losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to go above $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so how about $1,215,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,215,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,215,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's the final round, and we need to make a decision. While $1,215,000 is slightly below our last offer, it's crucial to weigh our options:

* **Accepting Bob's Offer:**  Secures a profit of $215,000 above our absolute minimum. This is a significant return and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely.
* **Rejecting and Losing the Deal:** This is very risky. There's no guarantee Bob will return with a better offer, and we'd be forced to sell to John for a much lower profit.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer in the final round is the most logical decision. It guarantees a strong profit and avoids the uncertainty and potential loss of continuing the negotiation beyond our allotted rounds."
