{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum value:** You're still leaving some room for potential profit and are not giving away the product for too low of a price. 

Remember, the goal is to find a price that's acceptable to both of you, while maximizing your profit.  We'll see how Bob responds and adjust our strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product is high to you, but given my budget, I'm looking to stay within $8,000. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than your minimum value of $15,000.  While it's tempting to accept his offer since it's closer to your perceived value of $8,000, you can potentially get a better deal by continuing the negotiation.  

**Here's why:**

* **Potential for higher offer:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, you show him that you're serious about your price and you're not desperate to sell. This might encourage him to increase his offer.
* **Maintain leverage:**  By not accepting Bob's offer, you retain the option to either negotiate further with Bob or sell to John for your minimum price.

We'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our prices, but still ensuring a profit for you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $9,000 is still a bit below my desired price. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This would give you a fair price, and it's a good starting point for a deal we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. It's a middle ground between your previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **Reasonable expectation:** $10,500 is still above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than your minimum value. 
* **Positive message:** The message highlights a ""fair"" price and a ""good starting point,"" fostering a sense of collaboration and encouraging further negotiation.

This counteroffer aims to push Bob closer to your desired price while still leaving room for further bargaining. Let's see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your proposal. I've considered your offer carefully, and while I'm interested in the product, I need to stay within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate down to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is very close to our counteroffer of $10,500.  At this point, it's strategically sound to accept his offer.

* **Maximizing Profit:** While we could try to push for a slightly higher price, the risk of Bob walking away and us having to sell to John for $15,000 is too high.  
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate could be time-consuming and might not yield a significantly better result. 
* **Potential for future deals:**  Accepting this offer could build a positive relationship with Bob, potentially opening doors for future transactions.

By accepting Bob's offer, we've secured a good price that's above his perceived value and allows us to move on to other opportunities."
