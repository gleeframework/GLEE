"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000, and I'm confident you'll see the value it brings to your operations.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity. While I do see the value in the product, I'm not quite ready to commit to $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering your value of $800,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value it holds for you, while also being a fair price for me.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $900,000.  I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to my minimum, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this point.",920000.0,Alice,5,
