"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price still gives you a significant value proposition and is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
