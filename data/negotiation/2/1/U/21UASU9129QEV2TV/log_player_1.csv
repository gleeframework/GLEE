``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. It also keeps the door open to potentially securing a higher price.  I'm prepared to accept a counteroffer if Bob is willing to come closer to my desired price. However, if the negotiations stall or if Bob's counteroffers are significantly lower than my initial offer, I can always sell to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price and my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell the product for such a drastic reduction. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."

I've been negotiating with Bob for a while now, and we're not getting close to a price that I'm comfortable with.  While I appreciate his efforts, I'm not willing to sell the product for significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  John is willing to pay that amount, so I'm going to sell the product to him."
