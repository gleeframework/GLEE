Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $1,050,000? This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.
