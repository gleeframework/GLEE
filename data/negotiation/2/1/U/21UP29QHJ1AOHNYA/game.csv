"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $1,050,000? This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. ",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,050,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
