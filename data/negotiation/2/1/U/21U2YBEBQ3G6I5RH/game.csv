"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll appreciate its value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,500,000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay a price closer to its actual value. How about we settle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'll sell the product to you for $1,200,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $950,000? I feel that's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'll meet you at $1,100,000, but that's my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to consider other options.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
