"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
The offer is significantly higher than Alice's value and my budget. There's a good chance of negotiating a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, that price is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,000,000?"", ""product_price"": 1000000} 

**Reasoning:**

*  Starting with a significant counteroffer tests Alice's flexibility.
* $1,000,000 leaves room for further negotiation while staying below my budget.
* A polite but firm message keeps the negotiation moving without being confrontational."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob.  While I'm eager to make a deal, $1,000,000 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to my range, $1,200,000 is still significantly more than her value. I'll reject and counter to signal I'm aiming lower while staying above her known value.  There's room to negotiate before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand the product's value, Alice, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Could we consider $1,100,000? I believe that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm moving closer to Alice's price in smaller increments to show willingness while applying pressure. 
* **Justification:**  Referencing my budget provides a reason for my counteroffer without revealing my absolute limit.
* **Seeking Compromise:**  Framing it as a ""fair compromise"" keeps the tone positive and solution-oriented."
