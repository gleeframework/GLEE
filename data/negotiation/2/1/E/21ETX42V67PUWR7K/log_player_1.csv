Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm asking for $19,000. I believe it's a great deal and would be happy to answer any questions you have."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you want to see if Bob will pay even more. Starting with a higher price gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Strategic Overpricing:**  A price of $19,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000). However, it creates an opportunity to:
    * Gauge Bob's interest level and potential for negotiation.
    * Potentially secure a much higher profit if Bob accepts.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** If Bob rejects the initial offer, you can always lower the price. This shows flexibility and might entice him while still staying above your minimum.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy.  Negotiation tactics can vary greatly depending on your knowledge of Bob, the product, and the market dynamics."
