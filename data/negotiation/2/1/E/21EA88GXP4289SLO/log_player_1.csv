``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $105 is better than nothing, I'm holding out for a bit more. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price point.  Let's see if we can get a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

While I'm getting closer to my desired price point, I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $108 is still too low for me. I'm hopeful that by continuing to negotiate, I can get a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $108 is still a bit too low for me. How about we compromise at $112?  It's a fair price that's in both of our interests."", ""product_price"": 112}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $107 is getting closer, it's still not enough to meet my minimum requirement. With John waiting in the wings, I want to hold out for a better deal."

This is it. I've been negotiating for a while, and it's getting pretty close to my minimum price point.  However, I'm concerned that I'm not going to be able to get a better deal with Bob.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. It's not the best deal, but it's a sure thing."
