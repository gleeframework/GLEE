"Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but  $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1750000. What do you think?",1750000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but I'm confident the product will bring you significant returns. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $1900000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1900000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1800000.  This is my final offer, and if we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1800000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1800000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm fairly compensated for the product. How about we discuss $1850000?",1850000.0,Alice,5,
