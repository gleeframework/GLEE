"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to the right person. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's make this happen!",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,500 and $13,000. How about we try $12,750? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I'm not comfortable going below $13,000. This is a high-quality product that's worth the investment.  What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable paying $13,000. I'm willing to go up to $12,900, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle and find a price that works for both of us.",12900.0,Bob,6,
