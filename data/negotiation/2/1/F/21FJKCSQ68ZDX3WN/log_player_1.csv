Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $175.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but lower than my minimum desired price ($150). This allows room for negotiation while still being profitable for me. I'm also using a friendly tone to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum desired price of $150.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $140.  That's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```
I'm offering $140, which is still above my minimum price but closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows flexibility while still getting a good price.  I'm also highlighting the value of the product to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we say $130? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my ideal value.  Since I have another buyer, John, who is willing to pay my desired price of $150, I'll choose to sell the product to him. This ensures I maximize my profit."
