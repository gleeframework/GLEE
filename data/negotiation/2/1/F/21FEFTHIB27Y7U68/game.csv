"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,100,000 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This reflects the significant value this product offers you, and it's a price I feel confident in.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
