"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm starting with an aggressive offer, aiming for a significant profit while still leaving room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept for the sake of closing the deal, I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm reducing my initial offer slightly, but still aiming for a profitable deal. I believe $1,600,000 is a fair price given the value of the product to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a slightly better price. I'll counteroffer one more time before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer, reducing my price to $1,550,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can finally close the deal. If not, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,480,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,480,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where the negotiations are getting too close to my minimum price, and I'm running out of rounds. To secure a guaranteed profit, I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I would have preferred to get a higher price,  selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired profit."
