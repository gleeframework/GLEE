"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You are willing to pay up to $15,000, but Alice is asking for $12,000. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **More rounds available:** You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so rejecting the first offer doesn't close off your options. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  By rejecting, you can make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  How about we split the difference and I pay $11,000?  Let's make this deal work!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12500. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While it's closer to your desired price, $12,500 is still above your ideal range. You have more room for negotiation.
* **You are still in a good position:** You have 7 rounds left, giving you time to push for a better deal.
* **Potential for a lower offer:**  By rejecting again, you can continue to negotiate and may get closer to your target price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12,500 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $11,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a good deal for you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're sticking to your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $12750. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to make a bit more of a concession to get this deal done. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still high:** While she's come down a bit, $12,750 is still well above your desired price point.
* **You have room to negotiate:**  You have 5 rounds remaining. You can continue to push for a lower price without running out of time.
* **Potential for a lower price:** It's likely that Alice is getting more flexible, and you can potentially secure a better deal by continuing the negotiation."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $12,750 is still above my budget. I'm going to stick with my original offer of $11,000. It's a fair price, and I believe it's in your best interest to accept it. Let's make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're sticking to your guns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While it's lower than previous offers, $13,000 is still above your ideal range, especially considering you only have 3 rounds left.
* **Potential for a better deal:** With a few rounds remaining, there's still a chance to push for a price closer to your $11,000 target. You've shown persistence, and Alice may be willing to budge more.
* **Risk of buying from John:** Buying from John for $15,000 would be significantly more expensive. You still have time to negotiate with Alice.

**Counteroffer Strategy:**

In Round 8, you should make a counteroffer slightly higher than your desired $11,000, but still lower than Alice's offer. This could be $11,500 or $11,750, depending on how much you believe Alice is willing to concede. This shows you're serious about getting a deal, but also that you're willing to walk away if it doesn't happen."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go a bit higher than my previous offer, but only if you're willing to meet me halfway. How about $12,000?  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 12000}

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $13250. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to make one more concession to get this deal done. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited negotiation time:**  You have only 1 round remaining. Alice is still unwilling to come down to your desired price range. 
* **Risk of losing time:**  If you reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer, there's a high chance Alice will reject it, leaving you with no deal and no time left to negotiate.
* **Better to secure the product:** Buying from John for $15,000 is expensive, but it guarantees you get the product. You've already pushed Alice as far as you can, and there's little time left for further negotiation.

It's better to secure the product from John, even at a higher price, than to risk ending up with no product and no negotiation time left."
