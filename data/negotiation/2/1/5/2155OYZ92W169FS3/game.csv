"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  How about we split the difference and I pay $11000?  Let's make this deal work!",11000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12500. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12500 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $11000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a good deal for you. Let's make this happen!",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're sticking to your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $12750. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to make a bit more of a concession to get this deal done. What do you think?",12750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $12750 is still above my budget. I'm going to stick with my original offer of $11000. It's a fair price, and I believe it's in your best interest to accept it. Let's make this deal work.",11000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're sticking to your guns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go a bit higher than my previous offer, but only if you're willing to meet me halfway. How about $12000?  Let's make this happen!",12000.0,Bob,8,
