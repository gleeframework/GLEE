"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $1,100,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're serious about this price, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal.  While I can't go lower than $925,000,  I'm willing to accept that as a final offer.  We've both been flexible, and this price allows for a successful deal for both of us.  It's a good price for you, and it's the best I can do at this point.  Let me know what you decide, as I'll be moving on to other options if we can't come to an agreement.",925000.0,Alice,9,
