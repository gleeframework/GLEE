"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth $18000 to me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. I'm willing to consider the product's quality and rarity, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $16000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $13500 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value and rarity.",14000.0,Alice,5,
