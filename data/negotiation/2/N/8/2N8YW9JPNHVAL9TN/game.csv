"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, I'm still finding it hard to justify $15,000.  Would you consider $12,000? That's a significant increase from my initial offer.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to drop to $13,500. This is a good price for both of us, as it's closer to your offer and still allows me to get a fair price for the product.  What do you say?",13500.0,Alice,5,
