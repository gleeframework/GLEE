{""product_price"": 150}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $150. This is a price that is higher than my minimum value of $120, giving me some profit. Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm aiming for a price that's potentially attractive to him but not so low that I leave significant money on the table.  If he rejects, I can still sell to John for $120, ensuring I don't lose out."
