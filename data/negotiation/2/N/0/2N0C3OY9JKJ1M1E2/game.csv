"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $1,300,000.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,350,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $1,200,000. How about we try $1,250,000? I think this is a fair price for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to reach an agreement. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,300,000 as a final offer. This is a significant compromise for me, but I'm hoping you see the value in this product and are willing to meet me at this price. If you decline, I'm going to have to explore other options.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
