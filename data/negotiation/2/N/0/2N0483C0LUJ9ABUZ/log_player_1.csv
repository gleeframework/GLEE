Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a price of $1,450,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have leverage to aim higher with Bob. 
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** A starting price of $1,450,000 gives you room to negotiate down while still potentially securing a significantly higher profit than your guaranteed sale.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  The message positions the offer as a valuable opportunity for Bob, emphasizing the product's worth.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, he might not be willing to pay significantly more. You need to gauge his interest and potential budget.
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared to negotiate. Bob might counteroffer, and you need to decide how low you're willing to go. Remember, you always have John as a fallback."
