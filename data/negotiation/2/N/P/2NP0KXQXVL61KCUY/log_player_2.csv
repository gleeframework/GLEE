"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is significantly higher than my upper limit and what John offers. It's best to counter-offer and negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, your initial price is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $650,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its value to me."",
""product_price"": 650000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** Starting significantly below Alice's offer (almost half) can help establish a lower negotiating baseline. 
* **Not Unreasonable:** While a big drop, $650,000 is still significantly above a potential zero profit for Alice if she can't sell it.
* **Sets the Stage:**  This forces Alice to reveal more about her willingness to negotiate downwards."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $650,000. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm open to negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice significantly lowered her price, indicating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still Too High:** $900,000 remains considerably above both my target price and John's offer.
* **Negotiating Room:** There's space to counteroffer again and aim for a price closer to my $800,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $900,000 is closer to the range I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:** Showing Alice I recognize her price reduction encourages further negotiation.
* **Strategic Compromise:**  Offering a price that's a true middle ground makes it appear like a good deal for both parties.
* **Still Below Limit:**  Crucially, $750,000 keeps me well below my absolute maximum while leaving some wiggle room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Bob. I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I'm not ready to meet you exactly in the middle. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm open to further negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing In:** Alice is definitely getting closer to an acceptable range.
* **Above Limit:**  $850,000 is still above my budget and what John offers. 
* **Room for Maneuvering:** With several rounds left, I can risk another counteroffer. Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and I might secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close! I appreciate your willingness to work with me. To be honest, my absolute limit for this product is $800,000. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tactic:** It's time to lay my cards on the table. By presenting this as my absolute maximum, I'm signaling that further negotiation is unlikely.
* **Walk-Away Leverage:**  By mentioning I can buy from John at this price, I create a sense of urgency and a reason for Alice to accept.
* **Simplified Decision:**  Alice now has a clear choice: sell at my price or potentially lose the sale altogether."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your limit, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm open to further negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Alice has countered, but she's only budged $25,000 from her previous offer. This suggests she's unlikely to meet my $800,000 target.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing negotiations has diminishing returns. It's highly possible I could spend several more rounds getting Alice down by tiny increments. 
* **John's Guarantee:**  Why risk overpaying when I have a guaranteed option at $800,000 from John? It's time to cut my losses and take the sure thing."
