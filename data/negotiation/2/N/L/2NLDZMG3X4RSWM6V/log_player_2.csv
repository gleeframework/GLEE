"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my budget. There's no way I'm going to accept that. It's better to counteroffer and see if we can come to a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $800,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? "", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget limitations. However, the product's value significantly exceeds your offer.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This reflects its true worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still significantly higher than my budget. I'll continue to negotiate and try to push for a price closer to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,400,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. This demonstrates my genuine interest, and I believe it's a fair price considering our respective budgets. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation. To be frank, selling for anything less than $1,200,000 is a significant sacrifice for me. I'm willing to accept $1,300,000, which is my final offer.  This allows us both to benefit from the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than my budget. However, she seems to be getting closer to a price I can accept. I will counter with a lower price and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, and I want to make this deal happen. However, $1,300,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  This is a compromise that allows us both to gain something from this transaction.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've carefully considered your offer, and I'm sticking to my previous price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair and final offer, reflecting the true value of the product. Let me know if you're ready to close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is adamant about her price, and while I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not comfortable going above my budget.  At this point, it's better to secure the product from John at a price that fits within my financial limits.  I've already reached a point where further negotiations with Alice are unlikely to yield a better result."
