"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $13000? I believe this would still be a fair deal for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,2,

I can offer you the product for $13500. This is a fair compromise that still allows you to get a great deal, while also ensuring I earn a reasonable profit. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
