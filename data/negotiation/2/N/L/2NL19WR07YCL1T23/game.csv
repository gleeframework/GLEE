"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $115.  Let me know what you think.",115.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $115 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $122.50? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to be flexible.",122.5,Alice,3,
