Alice's offer is way too high. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

```

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $7000, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully find a price closer to my maximum budget of $8000."

Alice's offer is still higher than my preferred price.  I'll reject again and see if I can get closer to my budget with another counteroffer."

I'm increasing my offer to $9000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget."

Alice's offer is still a bit higher than my preferred price, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer. I'll reject this offer and try one more counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."

I'm increasing my offer again to $10,000. This is my final offer before I'll go with John's price. It's a reasonable price point for both of us."

Alice is still not willing to go below $10,500. This is more than my preferred price and closer to my maximum budget, but it's still not a good deal. I'll buy the product from John for $8,000."
