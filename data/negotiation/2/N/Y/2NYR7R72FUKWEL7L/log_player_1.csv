Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. How about we meet in the middle of your offer and my previous offer, at $1,100,000? I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we are still leaving a significant amount of money on the table. We are willing to walk away with John's offer, so we have leverage. Let's keep pushing for a better deal."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,175,000, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, which is the lowest I'm comfortable going. I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Bob is unlikely to go much higher and we are already above our guaranteed sale price. Accepting $1,050,000 is a good deal in this situation."
