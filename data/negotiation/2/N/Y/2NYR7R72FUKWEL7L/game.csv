"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. It's truly one-of-a-kind and I know you'll recognize its immense value. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's unique qualities and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. How about we meet in the middle of your offer and my previous offer, at $1,100,000? I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I believe this product's value is closer to my initial offer.  To show I'm serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000.  This is my final offer, as I have other interested parties.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,175,000, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, which is the lowest I'm comfortable going. I hope we can meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
