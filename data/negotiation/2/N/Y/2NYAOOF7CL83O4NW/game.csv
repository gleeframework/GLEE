"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $200 is a bit steep, but I was thinking more along the lines of $180. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $180 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $140.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can close this deal.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're willing to go up to $140. I'm willing to meet you there, but I still need to make a profit. How about we compromise at $160? I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to cover my costs.",160.0,Alice,5,
