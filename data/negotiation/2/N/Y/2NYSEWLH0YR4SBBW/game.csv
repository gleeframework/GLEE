"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $14,000 is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget concerns, but $11,000 is quite a bit below my bottom line.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $11,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",11500.0,Bob,4,
