Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has value, your starting price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, I'm working with a tight budget on this.  Could we do $925,000? That's a significant jump from my last offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is moving closer to our acceptable range, we're still leaving a significant amount of potential profit on the table. We're willing to lose this deal if we don't get at least $950,000, so we'll push him a bit further."

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're tough!  I'm willing to bump my offer to $943,750.  That's splitting the difference again, showing you I'm serious about getting this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $943,750. 
You have three options:

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We are getting very close to our minimum acceptable price, but Bob is consistently willing to meet in the middle. This indicates he might have some flexibility left in his budget. We'll push one more time to try and secure a slightly better deal."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're a tough negotiator! I admire your tenacity. Let's aim for a win-win. How about $953,125?  It's a small adjustment, but I think it reflects the true value of what we're exchanging."",

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close!  I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I don't want to drag this out.  My final offer is $948,437.50.  It's firm, but fair. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $948,437.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $948,437.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has signaled that this is his final offer, and while it's not our ideal price, it's above our absolute minimum. Continuing to negotiate at this point might make Bob walk away entirely. Taking the $948,437.50 secures a very good profit and avoids the risk of losing him as a buyer."
