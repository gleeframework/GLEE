Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of your product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer you the product for $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you say?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to my maximum, I still have time to negotiate further.  I can try to get a lower price by counteroffering again. There are 7 rounds left, which gives me a good chance to reach a more favorable deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to come to a mutually agreeable solution. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $885,000.  This offer is a great compromise, and allows us both to be satisfied with the outcome. Let's close this deal now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $885,000 is within my budget and is a good compromise.  With only 5 rounds left, it's unlikely I'll get a significantly lower price.  Accepting the offer allows me to secure the product and save a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
