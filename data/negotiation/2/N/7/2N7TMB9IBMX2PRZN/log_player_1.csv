"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product given its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the value. However, the product's inherent worth and potential ROI justify a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This offer reflects a fair balance between our positions."", ""product_price"": 1075000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not convinced that $1,075,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, the gap between his offer and John's guaranteed offer is too large. It's unlikely Bob will reach a price point that justifies continuing the negotiation.  It's more profitable to take the sure sale with John."
