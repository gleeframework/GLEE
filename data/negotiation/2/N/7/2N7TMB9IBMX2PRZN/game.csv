"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product given its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value. However, the product's inherent worth and potential ROI justify a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This offer reflects a fair balance between our positions.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not convinced that $1,075,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay for this product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
