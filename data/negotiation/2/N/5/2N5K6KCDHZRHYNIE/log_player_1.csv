"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be of great value to you.  My asking price is $11,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 
 
 I'm starting with a high offer, but still leaving room for negotiation.  It's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $9,000 is still too low for me. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price, and I have a few more rounds to negotiate with Bob. Selling to John at this point would mean leaving $1,000 on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $10,000?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about $9,500? That's a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to $10,000,  $9,500 is a good deal considering the value the product holds for Bob and the risk of losing him as a buyer. I'm not willing to risk going another round with Bob, as I might end up getting less or even having to sell to John for a lower price."
