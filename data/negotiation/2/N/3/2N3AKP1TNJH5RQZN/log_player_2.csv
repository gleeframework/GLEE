"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is offering $120. While this is a good deal, you can potentially save more money by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price of $100, which is the midpoint between Alice's value ($80) and my maximum willingness to pay ($120). This is a fair starting point for negotiation, and it leaves room for further bargaining if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $110. This is a good deal for me, as it's still within my budget and saves me $40 compared to buying from John. It's likely that further negotiation would only lead to a small decrease in price, and the risk of John selling the product to someone else is not worth the potential savings."
