"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $125. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While $125 is less than your maximum budget, there's a chance to get it for even cheaper. Rejecting Alice's offer might make her propose a lower price.  You can always buy from John for $150 if she doesn't budge."
