Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. To be frank, I could go as high as $1,150,000, but that's really the limit for me.  I understand this might not be ideal, so I'll leave the decision in your hands."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is just $50,000 above your maximum offer. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the value you'll get from it. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Alice is now matching John's price. There is no further room for negotiation unless Bob wants to risk losing the deal entirely.  Accepting now guarantees Bob gets the product at his target price."
