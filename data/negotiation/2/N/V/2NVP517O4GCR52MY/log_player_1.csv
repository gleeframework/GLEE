I'm going to offer $12,500.  This is a compromise between my last offer and Bob's. It's a good middle ground that might be acceptable to both of us.  We're getting close to the end of the negotiation, so I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much money on the table."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is better than selling to John, I believe there's still potential to reach a better agreement with Bob.  I have a few more rounds to work with and I'm hoping to find a compromise that's more appealing."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to make a slightly higher counteroffer of $11,750.

With limited rounds left, it's crucial to find a middle ground that works for both of us."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's getting late in the negotiation and I need to make a decision.  While $11,000 is just a bit above my minimum, it's still a good deal considering the risk of having to sell to John for $10,000.  I'll take the deal and move on."
