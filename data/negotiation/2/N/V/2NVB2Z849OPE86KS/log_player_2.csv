"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.** You're getting the product for $95 from Alice, which is cheaper than the $100 John is asking.
* **You still get a good deal.**  You value the product at $100, and you're getting it for $95, so you're saving $5."
