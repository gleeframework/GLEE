"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a unique item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value and rarity.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $900000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product, reflecting its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $850000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $850000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $750000.  Let's see if we can make this work.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll meet you at $825000. This is a significant reduction from my original offer, and I think it's a fair price for this unique product. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway again.  $825000 is getting closer, but I'm still just a bit too high.  If you're serious about selling this product, let's meet in the middle at $800000.  This is the absolute maximum I can pay, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway again, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $800000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you at $815000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product, and I think it's still a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",815000.0,Alice,7,
