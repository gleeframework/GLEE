"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,000,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating to find a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer! While I agree this product has potential, your initial offer is a bit lower than I'd be comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price and reflects my genuine interest.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the initial price, but I believe the product's value is higher. Considering your willingness to pay $600,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new offer of $800,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product.",800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. However, there's still a gap between our valuations.  I can go up to $700,000, but that's my limit.  I believe this offer is a fair compromise and reflects the true value of the product.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not convinced that $700,000 is a fair price for this product. Considering your limit, I'm willing to make a small concession. I'm proposing a new offer of $750,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Alice,5,
