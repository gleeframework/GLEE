"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $130. It's a great deal for something worth $120 to you. Let me know what you think!",130.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $110 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $115?  It's a good deal for both of us, and we can close this out.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I can go as high as $115. How about $105? That's the lowest I'm willing to pay, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $105 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm not sure $110 is the best deal for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $108. Can we meet somewhere in the middle of that and $110?,108.0,Bob,6,
