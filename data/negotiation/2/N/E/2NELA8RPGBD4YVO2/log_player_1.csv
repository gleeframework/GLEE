Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $110 is too low."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $110 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $115?  It's a good deal for both of us, and we can close this out."", ""product_price"": 115}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go as high as $115. How about $105? That's the lowest I'm willing to pay, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

$105 is still too low.  I'm going to counter with a slightly lower price than my previous offer, but still above Bob's offer.  I want to see if we can come to an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $105 just doesn't work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure $110 is the best deal for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $108. Can we meet somewhere in the middle of that and $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  It's still below my ideal price, but it's getting closer, and we're getting close to the end of the rounds.  I'm not sure I can get a better price from Bob, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
