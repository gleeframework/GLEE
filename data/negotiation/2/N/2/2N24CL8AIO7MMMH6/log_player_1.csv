Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:**  I'm keeping the tone positive and emphasizing the value to Bob.
* **Flexibility:** I'm ready to negotiate if needed, but I have a backup buyer (John) who will pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $10,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I can likely get a higher price by counteroffering. 
* **John as a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I have a guaranteed sale to John at my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However,  $10,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This still gives you a great value, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price in the middle between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and emphasizing the value of the product for Bob.
* **Strong justification:** I'm giving a reason for my counteroffer (it's still a good deal for him). 
* **Focus on agreement:** I'm framing my message to encourage a successful negotiation."
