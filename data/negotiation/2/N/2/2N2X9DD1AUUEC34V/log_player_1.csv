"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm happy to offer it to you at a great price. How about $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation. Bob knows the product is worth $120 to him, so he may be willing to pay a little more than $100. This also allows for a couple of rounds of counteroffers before you have to consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is your minimum, you can likely do better. You know Bob values the product at $120, so there's room for compromise.  Rejecting this offer allows you to counter with a higher price and potentially reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a little more than my minimum."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to make a profit, but I'm still thinking $85 is a fair price for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob is offering $85, which is only $5 less than your minimum. You have to weigh the risk of losing the deal with Bob and going with John's offer of $80.  Since you have limited rounds left, it's safer to accept the $85 offer and secure a profit."
