{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,999. I believe it's a fantastic deal and worth considering."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible while still making a profit above my minimum ($12,000).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product for $11,999 creates the perception of a deal while still securing almost the maximum profit margin. 
* **Backup Option:** I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, so there's no risk in aiming high with Bob.

**Why this is better than offering a lower price:**

* Offering a price significantly lower (e.g., $10,000 or slightly above) leaves potential profit on the table. Bob might have been willing to pay more."
