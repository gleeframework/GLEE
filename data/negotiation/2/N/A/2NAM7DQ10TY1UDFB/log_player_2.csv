"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a little high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?"", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $700,000 is a significant gap from my initial ask, I'm willing to be flexible to find a solution that works for both of us.  Could you consider $950,000? This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $950,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000?"", ""product_price"": 825000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you're getting closer!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I can't go as low as $825,000, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is coming down on her price, her ""final offer"" of $900,000 is still higher than your alternative option of buying from John for $800,000.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice will get her below $800,000, even with 5 rounds remaining.  Therefore, it makes the most financial sense to secure the product from John at the lower price."
