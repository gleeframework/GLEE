"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a little high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $700,000 is a significant gap from my initial ask, I'm willing to be flexible to find a solution that works for both of us.  Could you consider $950,000? This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the true value of the product.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $950,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000?",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're getting closer!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I can't go as low as $825,000, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.  What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
