"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,000 is tempting, you can do better. You're willing to pay up to $12,000 and John will sell it to you for that price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you create an opportunity to negotiate a lower price with her or simply proceed with purchasing from John."
