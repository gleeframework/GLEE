Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love.  I'm asking for $175 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know it's worth to me ($150) and hoping Bob might be willing to pay a bit more, given his perceived value.  It's a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. Would you consider accepting $150 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's my minimum, I'd like to see if I can get a little closer to my initial asking price. I'm going to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $150 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $165, which is still a great deal for you considering its worth to you.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 165}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $165 is still a bit out of my budget, I would like to propose $155 as my maximum offer for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tricky situation. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $155 is only $5 less than what John is offering. It's better to accept and make a quick sale than to risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with a worse deal."
