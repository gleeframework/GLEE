"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $150, and John is offering it at that price, there's no need to negotiate with Alice. Buying from John guarantees you get the product at your maximum price."
