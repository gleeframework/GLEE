"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is lower than I expected, but it's still a decent price. I'll think about it... 

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I'll send him a counteroffer that's higher than his offer but still lower than the original price I was thinking of.

I'll offer Bob the product for $11,500.
