"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product for a great price! I'm thinking of $11,000, a steal considering its value to you is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a good deal, there's potential to save even more.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can initiate a negotiation and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $11,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500, which is still a fair price considering the value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,250, which is a fair compromise considering the value to you is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,250 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still not ideal.  By rejecting the offer again, Bob can continue the negotiation and attempt to get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,750, which is a fair compromise. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make a bit more than $10,750 to make it worth my while. I can offer it to you for $11,000, which is still a good deal considering the value to you is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is the same as her initial offer.  Bob has already indicated he's willing to pay up to $10,750, so accepting at $11,000 is a reasonable compromise.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal, especially since John is offering the product for $12,000."
