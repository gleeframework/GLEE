"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $800,000 to you. This is my final offer, as I have another buyer ready to pay $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice claims the product is worth $800,000 to you, you know your absolute maximum is $800,000, and you have a guaranteed option to buy it at that price from John.  Alice is using a common negotiation tactic by mentioning another buyer to pressure you. Don't fall for it! By rejecting her offer, you can move to John and secure the best possible price."
