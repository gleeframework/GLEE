"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below your estimated value and well above my minimum. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $1,100,000? This leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.  Let's close this quickly, as I have other potential buyers.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have other buyers, but I'm serious about purchasing this product.  While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. Would you consider $1,050,000? This shows I'm willing to compromise.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm committed to making this deal work, but  $1,050,000 is still a bit below my target.  Let's meet at $1,075,000. This price is fair, and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's close this quickly, as I have other offers on the table.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,060,000. This demonstrates my commitment to closing the deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",1060000.0,Bob,6,
