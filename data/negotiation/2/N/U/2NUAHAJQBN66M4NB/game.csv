"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in this product but my budget is a bit tighter.  I'd be willing to pay $125 for it.  What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $125. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. However, I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $155. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $155 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm sticking to my offer of $125.  If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to go with another seller.",125.0,Bob,4,
