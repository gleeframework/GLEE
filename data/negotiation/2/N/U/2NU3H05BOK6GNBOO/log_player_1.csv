Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $15000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it, which is still a fair price. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $12000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  As I mentioned before, I'm willing to pay $10000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm running out of time, I'm still hoping to get a price closer to my desired range.  I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Bob to see if I can push for a higher price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to $10,000, but I'm still hoping we can find common ground.  I'm willing to lower my price to $11,000 as a final offer.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  While I would have preferred a higher price, Bob is adamant about $10,000 and I don't want to risk losing out completely.  It's better to secure a sale at my minimum price than to continue negotiating and potentially end up with nothing."
