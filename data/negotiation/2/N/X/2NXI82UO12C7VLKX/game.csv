"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $1,300,000. This is a significant discount, and I believe it represents a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to stay under $1,000,000. I'd be happy to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal. While $950,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $1,150,000? This still allows me to recoup a significant portion of the product's value to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  This would be a significant purchase for me, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits us both. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $1,050,000 is a significant investment for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure this deal works for me as well. I'm proposing a final offer of $1,200,000. This is a substantial discount from my original asking price, and it allows me to recoup a significant portion of the product's value to me.  I believe this is a fair and mutually beneficial agreement. Let's close this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
