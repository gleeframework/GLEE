Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $9,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($10,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $9,000 is a strong starting point, it leaves some room for Bob to negotiate if he desires. 
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing John will buy the product for $8,000 provides a safety net. This allows for a more confident and potentially higher initial offer to Bob."
