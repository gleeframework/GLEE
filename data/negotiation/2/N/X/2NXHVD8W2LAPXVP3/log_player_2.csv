"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $9,000.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $9,000.** This means you would be paying $1,000 more than the product's worth to Alice.
* **John's price is $10,000.** While higher than Alice's offer, it's still within your budget.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to buy from John, but for a higher price.** This is still preferable to overpaying Alice by $1,000. 

By rejecting the offer, you save $1,000. Even though you're paying more than the product's worth to Alice, you're getting a better deal by buying from John."
