"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate the unique opportunity, $20000 is a bit outside of my budget. I'm very interested in this product and would be willing to pay up to $15000 for it. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $18000. This is a great compromise, considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $18000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $15000.  It's the highest I can go, but I'm truly interested in this product.",15000.0,Bob,4,
