Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to $150 as possible, as that's my best alternative with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $145 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's inclined, potentially getting me closer to $150.
* **Appear Reasonable:**  Offering a price slightly below my minimum acceptable price makes it seem like I'm being fair and not just trying to extract the maximum amount. 
 
This strategy aims to balance getting a good price from Bob while still ensuring the product sells if he declines."
