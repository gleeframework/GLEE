I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to adjust my price in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

I'm lowering my offer to $1,700,000. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but still leaves room for a profitable deal for me."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal. I don't want to risk losing the sale to John, and I'm confident I can find another buyer if this deal falls through."
