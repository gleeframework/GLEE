"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $700,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",700000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $700,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $600,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $650,000. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $625,000? Let me know if that works for you.",625000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I like the idea of meeting in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $625,000. I'm willing to go a bit further and offer $640,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",640000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for coming down a bit.  I'm getting closer to my limit, but I could do $630,000.  That's a very fair offer.",630000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to your limit, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $635,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",635000.0,Alice,7,
