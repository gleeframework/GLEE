# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I believe would be a game-changer for your business. Based on its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than her value of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.  Since Bob's maximum budget is $1,500,000, it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which reflects a substantial discount from my initial offer.  This price still allows for a significant profit for you while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution.

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's ideal price point, but closer. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if they can reach a mutually agreeable price.  There's still room for both parties to compromise."
