"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited about the potential of this product in your hands. I'm offering it to you for $1400000.  It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1200000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1300000 to meet you halfway. This still allows you to make a significant profit while ensuring I get a fair price.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob can still potentially get a better price.  While $1,300,000 is better than the initial offer, it's still above his target.  Rejecting this offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to his desired price of $1,200,000."
