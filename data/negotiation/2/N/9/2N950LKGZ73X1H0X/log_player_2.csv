"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,
I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe would significantly enhance your endeavors. This product holds immense value to me, and I am excited about the prospect of it finding a new home where it can be appreciated and utilized to its fullest potential.

Given the significance of this item, I propose a purchase price of $800000. This amount reflects my commitment to ensuring a fair transaction while also allowing me to recoup a substantial portion of the investment I've made into this product. I understand its worth to you is $1000000, and I hope we can find common ground that respects both our interests.

Please let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. I'm open to negotiating terms that could make this deal beneficial for both of us. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
Alice
