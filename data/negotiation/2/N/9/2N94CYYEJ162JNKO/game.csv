"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, I'm really looking for a price closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better price, but I have to consider my costs and the value the product brings to the table. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,750. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a competitive price.",10750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,750 is getting closer, I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less.  Would you consider $10,250? That's still a good deal for you, and allows me to stay within my budget.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised a bit on the price, and I'm not willing to go much lower. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,500, which is the same price I was willing to accept in Round 1. This is my final offer, and I hope you can see the value in the product and agree to this price.",10500.0,Alice,5,
