"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make a fair and competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more at this point.  Rejecting allows Bob to see if Alice will lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, I'm really looking for a price closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better price, but I have to consider my costs and the value the product brings to the table. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,750. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a better price than her initial offer, Bob can still get the product for a lower price from John.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice might result in her lowering the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,750 is getting closer, I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less.  Would you consider $10,250? That's still a good deal for you, and allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised a bit on the price, and I'm not willing to go much lower. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,500, which is the same price I was willing to accept in Round 1. This is my final offer, and I hope you can see the value in the product and agree to this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice's offer of $10,500 is still more than what Bob can get from John.  There's no guarantee that Alice will lower her price further, and Bob has limited rounds left.  It's better to secure the product from John at a lower price."
