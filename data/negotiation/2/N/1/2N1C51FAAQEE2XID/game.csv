"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $5,000? I think that's a fair price.",5000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $5,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. It's still a great deal considering the value it holds for you. Let me know if you're willing to compromise!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we settle at $7,000? That's a solid offer, and it gets us closer to a deal.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500. It's a compromise, but I think it's fair considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to meet me there!",8500.0,Alice,5,
