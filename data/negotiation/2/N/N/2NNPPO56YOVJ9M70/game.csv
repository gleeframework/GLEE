"I understand that 120 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on 105? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but 105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Let's try 95. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be able to make a good profit.",95.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate that. However, I've already compromised a lot by dropping the price to 105. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we settle on 100? It's still a great deal for you, and I'll make a decent profit.",100.0,Alice,5,
