"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $13500. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you is $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $12,500. That's still a fair price for both of us, and it gives me a good deal without breaking the bank."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $13750. This is the lowest I can go while still making a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is $1250 less than John's price.** This is a significant savings for Bob.
* **Alice's offer is also close to Bob's initial counteroffer.** This suggests there's little room for further negotiation, and continuing to bargain might risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Bob's goal is to save money, and accepting Alice's offer achieves that.** While getting a lower price would be ideal, it's not worth potentially losing the deal and having to pay John's higher price."
