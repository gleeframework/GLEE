"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $12500. That's still a fair price for both of us, and it gives me a good deal without breaking the bank.",12500.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $13750. This is the lowest I can go while still making a fair profit.",13750.0,Alice,3,,
