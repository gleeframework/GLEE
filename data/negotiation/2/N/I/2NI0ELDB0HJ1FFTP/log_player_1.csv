Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $80 to me, I'll offer it to him at a price slightly higher than that. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": 85}

This is a reasonable price that's still below the value Bob places on the product, so I'm hoping he'll accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","Bob rejected my initial offer, so now it's my turn to respond. Since Bob's offer is lower than my minimum price of $80, I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

I'll increase my counteroffer by $5 from Bob's offer, to $80. This is still below the value Bob places on the product, so I'm hoping he'll be willing to meet me in the middle.

Here's my counteroffer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer"", ""counteroffer"": 80}

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer or make another counteroffer!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob rejected my initial offer and I rejected his offer, I'll send him a new counteroffer. As I mentioned earlier, I'll increase my counteroffer by $5 from Bob's offer, to $80. Here's my new counteroffer:

{""product_price"": 80}

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as it's still below the value he places on the product."
