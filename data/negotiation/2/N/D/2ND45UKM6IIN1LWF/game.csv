"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $5,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is significantly less than what the product is worth.  I could come down to $17,000. I'm confident it'll prove valuable to you.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but $17,000 is still too steep for me.  How about $7,000?  That's a fair offer considering its value to me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I can see you're serious about this product. How about we split the difference and settle for $12,000? It's a very generous offer considering its true value.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I could meet you halfway at $9,000.  That's a strong offer on my end.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to make this work, but I need you to meet me closer to my price.  Let's settle this right now - $10,500 and it's yours.",10500.0,Alice,7,
