"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is too far below my minimum value.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. I'd accept $1,050,000 for the product. This gives you a good deal and allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a tight budget. I could stretch to $950,000. That's a significant increase from my last offer and would save me a lot compared to your previous price.  Let me know if that works for you.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up on your offer. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make a profit and you to acquire a valuable product. Let me know if this works for you.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
