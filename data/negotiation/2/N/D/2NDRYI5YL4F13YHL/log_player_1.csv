{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum value of $1,200,000, but I'm willing to negotiate. It's important to keep John's offer in mind as a safety net, but I want to try and get the best price possible from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to sell to John and secure the $1,200,000, I'm going to try to negotiate with Bob further to see if I can get closer to my target price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is too far below my minimum value.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. I'd accept $1,050,000 for the product. This gives you a good deal and allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
``` 

I'm taking a more aggressive approach this round, as I'm confident in the product's value. I'm dropping my price to a point that's still above my minimum but gives Bob a more enticing offer. I want to test the waters and see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a tight budget. I could stretch to $950,000. That's a significant increase from my last offer and would save me a lot compared to your previous price.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my target, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'm going to make one more counteroffer to see if I can push him closer to my desired price. Selling to John is always an option, but I want to exhaust all avenues with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up on your offer. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to make a profit and you to acquire a valuable product. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm offering Bob my final price point.  It's the bare minimum I'm willing to accept. If he refuses, I'll go with John's offer, but I'm hoping to make a deal with Bob at this price."
