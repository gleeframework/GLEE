"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  However, $120 is a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to do $90? I'm really interested in this product, and that's the most I can afford right now.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $90 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100.  That's a good deal for both of us, and I think it's fair considering the value of this product to you.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $100 is still a bit out of my range. Let's split the difference and go with $95.  I'm confident this is a fair price that works for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
