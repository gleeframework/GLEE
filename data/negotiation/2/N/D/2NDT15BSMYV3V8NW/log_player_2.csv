"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a better price than Alice's initial asking price, Bob can still get a better deal by either counteroffering or buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  It's a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's latest offer is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay, and he has a guaranteed option to buy from John at his target price."
