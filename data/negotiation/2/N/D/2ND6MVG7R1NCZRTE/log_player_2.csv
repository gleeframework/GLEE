{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $1,300,000 is still too high.  There's room for negotiation to get a better price.  It's worth exploring counteroffers before resorting to John's offer."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000}
```

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's halfway between Alice's initial offer and his own valuation of the product. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a significant discount."

```

**Reasoning:**

{""product_price"": 1,275,000}

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,300,000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is getting closer to John's price, Bob is still within range of getting a better deal.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This is a final attempt to get a lower price from Alice. It's a compromise between Alice's last offer and Bob's previous offer.  This is Bob's last chance to get a deal with Alice before he needs to consider John's offer.  Bob is taking a calculated risk, hoping that Alice will accept this final offer."

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is the same as John's price, and there's only one round left.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee that Alice will accept a lower offer.  It's more logical to buy the product from John, as there's no risk of losing the deal and the price is the same."
