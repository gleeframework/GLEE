You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, $60 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100, which is a significant discount from my original price.  Let me know if that works for you.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $75 simply won't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a great deal for you. Let's try to find some common ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to come down significantly from $90.  It's better to secure the product from John at $80 and avoid further negotiation."
