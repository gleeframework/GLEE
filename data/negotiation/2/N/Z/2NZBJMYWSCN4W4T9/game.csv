"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While your valuation is understandable, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  I believe this reflects a fair compromise.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,700,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us, but I need to be realistic. I'm willing to accept $1,825,000. This is my final offer.",1825000.0,Alice,5,
