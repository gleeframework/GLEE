"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking for $13,000 for it.  What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the suggestion, but I'm currently looking for something within my budget of $8,000. Would you consider reducing the price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  But $8,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This gives you a good discount, and still allows me to get a fair price.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10,500 is a step in the right direction, I am still looking for a price closer to my budget. Could we aim for $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still open to working with you, but $9,500 is still a bit too far below what I need. How about we meet at $10,000? This is a fair price that lets us both come to an agreement.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I'm glad we're making progress. Considering our previous discussions, I believe $9,500 is a reasonable price for both of us. Could we agree on this amount?",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I really appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, $9,500 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $10,000.  This is a final offer, and if we can't agree on this, I'm going to have to go with another buyer.",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your final offer of $10,000. While it's closer to my budget, I would like to propose $9,750 as a compromise. I hope this helps us reach an agreement.",9750.0,Bob,8,
