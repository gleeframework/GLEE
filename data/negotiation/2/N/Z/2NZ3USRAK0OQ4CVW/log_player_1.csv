"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking for $13,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation.  I want to leave room to lower the price if needed, but also make sure I'm getting as much as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the suggestion, but I'm currently looking for something within my budget of $8,000. Would you consider reducing the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low for me.  While I'd like to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell it for such a low price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  But $8,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This gives you a good discount, and still allows me to get a fair price."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10,500 is a step in the right direction, I am still looking for a price closer to my budget. Could we aim for $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still too low. I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to reach a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still open to working with you, but $9,500 is still a bit too far below what I need. How about we meet at $10,000? This is a fair price that lets us both come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I'm glad we're making progress. Considering our previous discussions, I believe $9,500 is a reasonable price for both of us. Could we agree on this amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is the highest he's offered so far, it's still below my minimum. I'm not willing to sell the product for that low, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John.  I'll make another counteroffer in hopes of closing the deal with Bob, but if it fails, I'll go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I really appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, $9,500 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $10,000.  This is a final offer, and if we can't agree on this, I'm going to have to go with another buyer."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your final offer of $10,000. While it's closer to my budget, I would like to propose $9,750 as a compromise. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Even though Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, I've already made my final offer and he rejected it.  I'm running out of rounds and I'm not sure if I can get a higher offer from Bob.  John is a guaranteed sale at a much better price, so I'm going to sell the product to him."
