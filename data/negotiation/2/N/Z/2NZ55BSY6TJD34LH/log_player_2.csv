"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $150 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
``` 

Since you're willing to pay $150 for the product, and John is offering it at that price, there's no reason to negotiate with Alice."
