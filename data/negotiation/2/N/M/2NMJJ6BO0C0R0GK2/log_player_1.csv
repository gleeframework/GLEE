Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm setting the price at $19,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have room to negotiate with Bob. Starting at $19,000 gives you a cushion to potentially come down in price while still making a significant profit. 
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value without explicitly stating your minimum. This allows room for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he finds the initial price too high. 
* **Alternative:** If you want to be more aggressive, you could start even higher (e.g., $20,000). However,  a higher starting point increases the risk of Bob immediately rejecting the offer without a counter."
