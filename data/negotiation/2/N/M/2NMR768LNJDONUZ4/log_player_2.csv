"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm offering it to you at a price that's still very fair.  What do you say to $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $115 is tempting, you can do better. You're willing to pay up to $120 and John will sell it to you at that price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or simply proceed to buy from John and save $5."
