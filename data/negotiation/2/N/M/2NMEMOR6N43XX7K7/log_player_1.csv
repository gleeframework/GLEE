I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum desired value ($1,500,000). This gives me some room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters, while also setting a strong initial position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with that price. I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob. I'll counter with a lower price than my original offer, but still above his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering a price of $1,550,000.  This is a slight decrease from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still above Bob's offer, leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob is getting too low with his offers.  While I would love to close the deal with him, I'm not willing to go that far down in price. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for my minimum price."
