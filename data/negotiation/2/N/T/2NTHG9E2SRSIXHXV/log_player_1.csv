Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm always open to finding common ground.  $975,000 is closer, but I need to be at $1,000,000 to make this work for me.  It's a fair price considering the value you'll gain from this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
