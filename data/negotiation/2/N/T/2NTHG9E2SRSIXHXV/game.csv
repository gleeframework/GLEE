"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a price of $1,200,000. It's a significant investment, but I believe its value to you will justify the cost. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $900,000 is a good offer, I'm still a bit away from my desired price point.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This would allow us both to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  That said, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000 and call it a deal?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm always open to finding common ground.  $975,000 is closer, but I need to be at $1,000,000 to make this work for me.  It's a fair price considering the value you'll gain from this product. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
