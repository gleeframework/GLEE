"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is a good price, it's still above your maximum budget of $100. There's room for negotiation, and you have 9 more rounds to try and get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $75, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $85. This demonstrates my serious intent to purchase the product while still remaining within my budget. This initial offer provides a good starting point for negotiation and allows for potential compromise in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price. There's still room for negotiation, and I have 7 more rounds to try and get a better deal. I'm willing to risk another round of counter-offers to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $80. This shows Alice I'm willing to compromise but also demonstrates that I'm not willing to go above my budget.  This price is closer to Alice's offer of $90, suggesting a possible deal within a few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is now within my budget, and while it's not ideal, it's close enough to my desired price point. It's better than going through more rounds of negotiation, especially considering I only have 5 rounds left.  Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product without risking further negotiation or potentially missing out on the deal altogether."
