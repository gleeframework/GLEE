Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know you see the inherent value in it, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm willing to make this transaction particularly worthwhile for you with a special offer of $950,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with a price slightly below John's offer ($950,000) leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **High But Reasonable:**  While $950,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000), it's presented as a ""special offer"" and emphasizes the product's benefits, potentially swaying his decision. 
* **Time Pressure:** Adding a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of a successful sale to Bob."
