"Bob, I understand you're looking for a significant discount, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,350,000, which I believe is a fair compromise given the value of this product.  Let's keep the negotiation going, and hopefully we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
