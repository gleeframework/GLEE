"I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a good deal for you.  Let's make this happen.",150.0,Alice,3,
