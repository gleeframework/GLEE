**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is below your maximum budget, you can do better. John is willing to sell the same product for $1,000,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you create the opportunity to negotiate a lower price with her or proceed with purchasing from John at a lower cost."
