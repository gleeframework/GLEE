"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $18,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. How about we meet in the middle at $16,500? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $16,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $15,000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",15000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a good price for you, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to compromise further. How about we meet at $16,000? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to make one more concession.",16000.0,Alice,5,
