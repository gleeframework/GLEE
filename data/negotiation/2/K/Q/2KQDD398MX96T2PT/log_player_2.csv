Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is trying to get the best deal possible, so starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price is a good strategy.
* $12,000 is a reasonable starting point, considering Bob's maximum budget is $15,000 and he wants to save as much as possible.
* This counteroffer leaves room for negotiation and potential compromise in the following rounds."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's desired price, though getting closer to his budget.

* It's worth exploring if Alice will come down further."

* $14,000 is a reasonable compromise, considering Bob's willingness to pay $15,000 from John.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is now within Bob's budget, making it a more attractive option.
* Accepting this offer means Bob saves $1,500 compared to buying from John.
* While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice might reject further counteroffers, and Bob might end up paying more or buying from John at a higher price.
* This offer represents a good compromise that balances savings and the risk of losing the deal."
