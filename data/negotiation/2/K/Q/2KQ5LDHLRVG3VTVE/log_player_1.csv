Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the value of the product to you, subtly suggesting that it might be worth more to Bob. If Bob rejects, you can always fall back to John's offer of $80."
