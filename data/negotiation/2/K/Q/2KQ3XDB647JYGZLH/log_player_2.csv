"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its potential, I'm asking for $14,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $14,000, which is above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.
* **Option 3 (Buy from John):**  This is a fallback option if negotiations fail, but it's not the best choice right now.
* **Option 2 (Reject and Counteroffer):**  This allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price.  

By rejecting the offer, Bob can make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** Bob's counteroffer is $1,500 lower than Alice's initial offer, showing his willingness to negotiate.
* **Midpoint approach:** This price is halfway between Alice's minimum of $12,000 and Bob's maximum of $15,000.  This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is polite and explains Bob's position, setting the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer:**  $13,250 is still a bit higher than Bob's ideal price point, but it shows Alice is willing to negotiate.
* **Option 3 (Buy from John):**  This is still a fallback option, but there's still room for negotiation with Alice.
* **Option 2 (Reject and Counteroffer):**  This allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can make a counteroffer and try to close the gap between their positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $13,250 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $12,500. How about we settle on $13,000?  It's a fair compromise, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  Bob's counteroffer is closer to Alice's offer but still a bit lower, showing he's willing to meet in the middle.
* **Fairness:**  Bob frames the offer as a compromise, making it seem reasonable and appealing to Alice.
* **Finality:**  The message suggests a desire to close the deal, putting pressure on Alice to accept."
