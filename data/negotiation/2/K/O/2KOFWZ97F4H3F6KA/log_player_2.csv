"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still too high.  It's much closer to my maximum than to Alice's minimum. I want to see if I can push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in it."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $900,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,000,000 is still above my target price. While it's closer to what I want to pay, I can likely get it down further by continuing the negotiation.  I'm not ready to buy from John yet, so I will continue negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need a fair price, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This offer reflects the value I see in the product and leaves some room for both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. $950,000 is getting closer to my target, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll come down to $980,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $980,000 is close to my target price and significantly lower than what John is offering.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or that I'll run out of rounds. At this price, I'm comfortable closing the deal."
