"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's a game changer and I believe it has the potential to be worth well over $1,000,000 to you.  I'm willing to start with a price of $1,250,000.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,250,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its potential value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $800,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,050,000.  This reflects both the value of the product and the potential we can both realize from it.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential value of the product.  Let's see if we can make this work.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your compromise, and $950,000 is getting closer.  However, I'm still confident in the value of this product and would need to see a price closer to $1 million.  Let's meet in the middle at $975,000.  This would allow us both to secure a good deal and move forward.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $975,000 is still a bit high, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $962,500. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a deal and move forward.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",962500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your commitment to finding a solution.  While $962,500 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1 million.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $968,750.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value of this product.  Let's make this deal happen!",968750.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, we're almost there!  I'm willing to go up to $965,000, which is a great price for both of us.  Let's close this deal and get this product in my hands!",965000.0,Bob,8,
