"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a serious offer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than her value for the product ($800,000).  You can likely get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $900,000 is a bit too high for me.  Considering your value for the product, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is still a good deal for you, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $875,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident it's a deal you won't want to pass up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is still within your budget and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John for $1,200,000.  While you could potentially negotiate further, the potential gain is small, and it's not worth the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and potentially having to buy from John."
