Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you're interested in.  I'm asking for $12,000 for it.  It's a fair price considering its value, and I'm confident you'll see it's a great investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I've started with a price of $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn more than my minimum desired price of $10,000. 
* **Positive Framing:** I've phrased the message in a positive way, emphasizing the value of the product and implying it's a good investment. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I've ended the message with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and potentially counter-offer.

This initial offer sets the stage for negotiation, allowing me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially reach a mutually beneficial price. I'm also keeping in mind the option to sell to John for $10,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm not sure it's worth $12,000 to me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for it, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  While I could accept it and avoid the risk of further negotiation, I'd be losing out on potential profit.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter-offer with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm not able to go that low.  Given the product's quality and its value, I'd be willing to come down to $10,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to ensure I get a fair price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I've rejected Bob's offer but countered with a price that's still within my acceptable range. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also firm about my minimum desired price.
* **Highlighting Value:** I've emphasized the value and quality of the product to justify my price point.
* **Positive Tone:** I've kept the tone positive and friendly to maintain a good rapport with Bob.

This counter-offer aims to find a middle ground and hopefully reach a deal. I'm still prepared to sell to John for $10,000 if Bob rejects this offer again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for the product, as I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has come up from his initial $8,000 offer, his counter-offer of $9,000 is still below my minimum desired price of $10,000.  I've already lowered my price from my initial $12,000, and I'm not confident I can get him any higher. 

Rather than risk further negotiation and potential deadlock, I'm going to accept the sure deal with John at $10,000.  This ensures I get my minimum desired price and avoids the uncertainty of continuing negotiations with Bob."
