"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I believe it has the potential to be extremely valuable for your business.  I'm asking for $2000000. This price reflects the product's unique capabilities and potential for growth. I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential, but I'm not sure it's worth the $2000000 you're asking.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your interest. While $1200000 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to accept $1750000 for the product. This price reflects the significant value it offers and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's find a way to make this work.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1750000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1400000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and still reflects the value of the product.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
