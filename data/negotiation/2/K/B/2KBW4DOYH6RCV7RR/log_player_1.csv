Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering its potential worth to you."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim for a price significantly higher than John's offer ($800,000).
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering it slightly below his valuation ($925,000) makes it a compelling deal while leaving room for potential negotiation.  

This strategy attempts to secure the highest possible profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
