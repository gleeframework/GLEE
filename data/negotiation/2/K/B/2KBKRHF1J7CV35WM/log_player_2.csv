"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Alice's starting offer is too high.  I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much room there is for negotiation. I don't want to offer too close to $8,000 right away, as that's my backup option with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

Alice is unwilling to go below my fallback price of $8,000.  It's time to take John's offer."
