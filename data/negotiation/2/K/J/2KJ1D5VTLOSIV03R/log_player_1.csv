"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and encouraging message can help build rapport and make Bob more likely to consider the offer. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  Highlighting the value of the product can sway Bob towards accepting a higher price. 
* **Room for Counteroffers:**  I'm leaving enough space for Bob to counter without making me feel like I have to immediately drop to his value.

**Note:**  I'm not immediately going for my minimum of $12,000. This strategy aims to test Bob's willingness to negotiate and potentially get a better price than what John is offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While Bob is showing interest, his offer is still $1,500 below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to try and reach a price closer to my desired value.
* **John is a backup option:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $12,000 gives me leverage in the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to round 3 and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to get closer to my desired price while keeping in mind the possibility of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $10,500 is a good starting point, I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $11,000?  That's still a good deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between Bob's offer and my previous offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Reinforcement:**  I reiterate Bob's interest and use positive language like ""good deal"" to keep him engaged.
* **Focus on Value:** I remind Bob about the product's value and how it will benefit him.

**Note:** I'm still aiming to get a higher price than John's offer, but I'm also being realistic and taking into account Bob's willingness to negotiate. I'm confident that with a few more rounds, I can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9800. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** Bob's offer of $9,800 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob seems determined to keep the price low, I believe I can still push for a higher price. 
* **John's offer is secure:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $12,000, which provides me with leverage in the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to round 5, where I will make a counteroffer aimed at finding a compromise closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence.  However, $9,800 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $10,800 to make this work.  This is still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm making it clear that I won't accept a price below my minimum but am still willing to negotiate.
* **Compromise:** I'm offering a slightly lower price than my previous offer, showing flexibility.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to accept a higher price.
* **Positive Language:**  I'm keeping the tone positive to avoid escalating the negotiation.

**Note:** 
* I'm now at $1,000 below my minimum acceptable price.
* I'm still leaving room for Bob to counteroffer, but I'm confident that we're getting closer to a mutually agreeable price. 
* I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $12,000 if the negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still thinking $9500 is the maximum I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $9,500 is still $2,500 below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob seems determined to keep the price low, there is still a $1,300 gap between our offers. 
* **John's offer is secure:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $12,000, which provides me with leverage in the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to round 7, where I will make a counteroffer aimed at finding a compromise closer to my desired price point. I'll need to make a significant compromise to get Bob to raise his offer significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on your price, and I appreciate your honesty. Let's try to bridge the gap. How about $10,100? It's a good middle ground and I think you'll be happy with the product at that price. This is my final offer before I have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 10100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Compromise:**  I'm now offering $1,100 below my minimum, showing a strong commitment to reaching an agreement. 
* **Final Offer:**  I'm stating this is my final offer to create urgency and pressure Bob to reconsider.
* **Middle Ground:**  I'm emphasizing a ""middle ground"" to make the offer feel more appealing to Bob.
* **Time Pressure:**  I'm hinting at considering other options, like selling to John, to further motivate Bob.

**Note:** 
* I'm getting closer to Bob's desired price but still above my minimum.
*  The goal is to test whether Bob will increase his offer or if he's truly committed to his current price. 
*  If Bob rejects this offer, I will likely move to sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still thinking $9000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet on this price. I'm open to negotiating further, but I need to see some movement from your end. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and even further away from my desired price.
* **Limited Time:** With only two rounds remaining, I have very little time to close a deal with Bob.  
* **John's offer is secure:**  Selling to John for $12,000 will guarantee me a profit and is far more beneficial than accepting Bob's low offer. 
* **Bob's ultimatum:**  Bob's statement that he's ""willing to walk away"" indicates he's unlikely to budge much further, and I'm unwilling to risk losing the sale entirely.

**Conclusion:**

Considering the time constraint, Bob's final offer, and the certainty of John's offer, it's in my best interest to accept John's offer and sell the product for $12,000."
