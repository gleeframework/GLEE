"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to offer you the product for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your target price of saving as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $900,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to earn a significant profit. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still above what you want to pay.  Rejecting the offer again opens the door for further negotiation and potentially a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $890,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to negotiate further. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made her final offer, and while it's still higher than you initially hoped, it's getting close.  Rejecting and counter-offering again risks losing the deal altogether, as Alice is not willing to negotiate further. Accepting the offer allows you to get the product for $890,000, which is a significant saving compared to John's price of $1,000,000."
