Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters with a lower price.  It's important to start high to see if Bob is truly interested and to maximize my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

$12,000 is far below my minimum, so I'm not going to accept that. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

I'm countering with $17,000. This is still above my minimum and leaves some room for further negotiation if needed. I'm trying to find a middle ground while remaining profitable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still going to reject it. I think I can get a bit more from Bob. I'll make one more counteroffer."

I'm offering $15,500. This is a bit more than my minimum and I'm hoping it will be enough to close the deal with Bob.  I'm not sure if I can push for more, especially since I could sell to John for $15,000 right now."
