"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get the best possible deal.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering the value to you and my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
