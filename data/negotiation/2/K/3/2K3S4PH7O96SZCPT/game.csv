"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll love it!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit.  While $10,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your target price is $9,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9500.0,Alice,5,
