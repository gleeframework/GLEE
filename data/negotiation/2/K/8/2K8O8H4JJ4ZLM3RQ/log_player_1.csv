Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This gives you some flexibility if Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **It's a good opening price:** It shows that you're serious about selling but also willing to negotiate. 

I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to counter if he doesn't!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer is too low for me. While I want to make a deal, I'm not willing to sell for less than $150. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140. How about we split the difference?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $140, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $130? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm tempted to continue negotiating, Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum.  I've already come down significantly from my initial offer, and I'm not sure how much more I'm willing to budge.  It's better to sell to John for $150 and ensure I get a price I'm comfortable with."
