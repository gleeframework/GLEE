Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a unique opportunity to own a truly valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering its rarity and potential benefits.,950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the potential value of this product, $950000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $750000 for it. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering my financial constraints.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair price considering our previous discussions.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $800000, which is my absolute maximum. This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it represents a fair price for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to make a serious offer, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable accepting $800000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $825000. This is my final compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions.",825000.0,Alice,5,
