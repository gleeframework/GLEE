"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum acceptable price, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will find the product valuable enough to pay close to that price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm willing to sell to John for $80, Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $90. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in my product and be willing to pay a little more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is $85, which is higher than John's offer of $80 and just above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him."
