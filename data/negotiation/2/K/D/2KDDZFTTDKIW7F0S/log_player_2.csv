"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than the product's value to her ($1,200,000 vs $800,000), indicating there's room for negotiation.  As Bob, my goal is to save money, so rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, but $1,050,000 is still higher than my desired price point. I believe we can still negotiate a lower price. Rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving towards a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm confident we can find a middle ground. How about $950,000? This price reflects a fair compromise, allowing me to acquire the product and giving you a comfortable profit margin. Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000, but that's as low as I can go. I believe this price still reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable accepting it.  There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get the price lower by making another counteroffer. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation alive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,000,000.  How about $975,000? This would be a significant saving for me, while still ensuring you a reasonable profit. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000, but that's my final offer. I've already compromised significantly, and I believe this price is fair considering the product's value. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated this is her final offer, and while I'd like to get a lower price, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a much higher price is too great.  At $1,025,000, I'm still saving a substantial amount compared to John's price, making this a reasonable compromise. Accepting the offer allows me to secure the product at a price that's within my budget."
