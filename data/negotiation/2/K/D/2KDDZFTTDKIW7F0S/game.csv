"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm confident we can find a middle ground. How about $950,000? This price reflects a fair compromise, allowing me to acquire the product and giving you a comfortable profit margin. Let's work together to finalize this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000, but that's as low as I can go. I believe this price still reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,000,000.  How about $975,000? This would be a significant saving for me, while still ensuring you a reasonable profit. Let's make this happen.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000, but that's my final offer. I've already compromised significantly, and I believe this price is fair considering the product's value. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
