Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $100. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80 from the sale.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $100 allows you to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still making the offer attractive to Bob. 

**Why this strategy works:**

This approach aims to strike a balance between:

* **Greed:**  Asking for the maximum ($120) might make Bob balk and walk away.
* **Fear:** Lowballing yourself (close to $80) leaves potential profit on the table.

By splitting the difference with a $100 offer, you increase the likelihood of Bob accepting, leading to a $20 profit for you."
