"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $115, which is above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive tone:** My message is friendly and optimistic, encouraging Bob to consider the offer.
* **Focus on value:**  I highlight the potential benefit to Bob, making the offer more attractive. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I leave the door open for further discussion, indicating flexibility."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.** While it's closer to my desired outcome, I'm still not willing to settle for less than $120.
* **I believe I have leverage:**  I have a backup buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price. This gives me the confidence to hold out for a better offer from Bob. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price with Bob in the remaining rounds."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within range:** I'm staying above my minimum price of $120 while making a concession to show flexibility.

* **Positive tone:** My message remains upbeat and emphasizes a win-win outcome.

* **Final offer:** I'm setting a firm price, signaling to Bob that this is my last concession. 
* **Time pressure:** I'm using a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Threat of alternative:** I'm mentioning another buyer to emphasize my willingness to walk away if Bob doesn't accept. 
* **Fair compromise:** I'm offering a price that's still above my minimum but shows I'm willing to meet Bob halfway. 

**Note:**  I'm trying to balance the need to get a good price with the risk of losing the deal altogether. By setting a firm final offer and creating a sense of urgency, I hope to encourage Bob to accept before time runs out."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** With only two rounds left, there's not enough time to negotiate a higher price with Bob.  
* **Bob's offer is still too low:** Even with his last offer, he's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Guaranteed sale to John:** I have a guaranteed sale to John at $120, which is my minimum price and ensures I don't lose money.

**Conclusion:** It's better to sell to John and secure my minimum price rather than risk losing the sale altogether by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
