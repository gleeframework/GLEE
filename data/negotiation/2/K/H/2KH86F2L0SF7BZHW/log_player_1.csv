Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000:** This is a starting point that's a significant discount from my minimum ($1,500,000), making it attractive to Bob, but still leaves me room for negotiation.
* **Message:** It's friendly and invites Bob to engage in further conversation. It also subtly highlights the value of the product to both of us. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Start negotiations high:**  I'm not immediately giving away my bottom line.
* **Be open to negotiation:**  The message encourages Bob to counter-offer, allowing us to find a mutually acceptable price.
* **Keep the option of selling to John:**  If Bob doesn't come close to my minimum price, I can always walk away and get my minimum from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly below my desired price.  I want to try to get closer to my minimum before considering selling to John. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price higher than $900,000 but still lower than my minimum, hoping to find a middle ground."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm offering $1,050,000, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise. 
* **Message:** The message emphasizes the need for a fair price for both of us while acknowledging Bob's perspective. It also keeps the door open for further negotiations.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maintain leverage:** I'm not giving in to Bob's initial low offer, but I'm also showing flexibility.
* **Signal seriousness:**  By making a concrete counteroffer, I'm demonstrating my willingness to reach a deal.
* **Keep John as a backup:** I'm still within range of my minimum and can easily sell to John if this negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offers, it's still a significant distance from my desired price.  I'm not ready to settle for that yet, and I believe there's still room for negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I will make another counteroffer, likely closer to $1,000,000, hoping to find a price that both Bob and I find acceptable.  I'll try to emphasize the value of the product and the potential for a long-term partnership with Bob. However, I'm also prepared to sell to John if Bob remains unwilling to meet me closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers - I'll offer you the product for $1,000,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I truly believe this price reflects the value of the product.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $1,000,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $1,050,000 and Bob's latest offer of $950,000. 
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the compromise I'm making and highlighting the value of the product to justify the price. I'm also making it clear that I'm open to further discussion and finding a solution that works for both of us.

This strategy aims to:

* **Show Flexibility:** I'm demonstrating my willingness to compromise to reach a deal.
* **Maintain Value:** While I'm lowering my offer, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the value of the product to me.
* **Set a Deadline:**  By suggesting that $1,000,000 is my final offer, I'm putting pressure on Bob to make a decision.  I'm ready to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000. This is as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $980,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my desired price.  I've already made substantial compromises, and it seems clear that we're unlikely to reach an agreement that's mutually beneficial.  Rather than continuing a potentially fruitless negotiation, I'm going to take the guaranteed profit from John. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Money:**  The longer I negotiate with Bob, the more time I'm losing.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price.
* **Potential for Future Deals:** While I'm losing a potential customer in Bob, there might be other buyers in the future who are willing to pay a price closer to my value.

By selling to John, I can secure a good profit and move on to other opportunities."
