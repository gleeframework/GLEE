"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers - I'll offer you the product for $1,000,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I truly believe this price reflects the value of the product.  What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000. This is as high as I'm willing to go.",980000.0,Bob,6,
