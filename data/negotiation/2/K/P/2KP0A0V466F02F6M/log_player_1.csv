Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $14,000. "", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We know Bob values the product at $15,000. Offering it at $14,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference while still leaving Bob with a net benefit ($1,000) from the purchase.
* **Balancing Risk:**  While you could aim for a higher price (e.g., $14,500), there's a risk Bob might find it too expensive and reject the offer. Selling to John guarantees $8,000, but you leave potential profit on the table.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer provides a starting point for potential negotiation. If Bob counters, you have the flexibility to adjust slightly downward while still remaining above your minimum acceptable price."
