"I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering it's worth $1,000,000 to you. I believe this deal is beneficial for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep, but I have to consider the value the product holds for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer.  Let's try to meet in the middle and see if we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our last offers, so I'll offer the product to you for $975,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm happy to see you're willing to come down in price.  However, $975,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay.  I'm offering $950,000, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer.  I believe this price is fair for both of us, and it would be a great way to conclude this negotiation.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $980,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our last offers, so I'll offer the product to you for $965,000. This is a compromise, and I believe it's the best we can do at this point.",965000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating.  $965,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $960,000 for the product.  This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us.  I hope we can come to an agreement in this round.",960000.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $970,000. I'm willing to make one final compromise, so I'll offer the product to you for $962,500. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me.",962500.0,Alice,9,
