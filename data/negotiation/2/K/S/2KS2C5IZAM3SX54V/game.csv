"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $825,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a slightly lower price point. How about we settle at $725,000? I believe this offer reflects a fair deal for both of us.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to reach a fair deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $775,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into the negotiation so far.",775000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $775,000 is getting close, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider $750,000?  I feel that's a fair and reasonable final offer.",750000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $765,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into the negotiation so far. I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not sure I can go any lower.",765000.0,Alice,7,
