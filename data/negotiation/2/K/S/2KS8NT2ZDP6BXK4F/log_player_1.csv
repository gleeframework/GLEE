Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, which is our guaranteed sale price to John.
* **Negotiating Room:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly if he's very interested, but still ensures a significant profit above his perceived value of $12,000. 
* **Time Value:** While we have a guaranteed buyer, a quicker sale to Bob might be preferable even with a slightly lower profit margin.

This strategy balances getting the best possible price from Bob while minimizing the risk of him rejecting the offer and forcing us to sell to John."
