"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product at a competitive price. Given its worth to you is $12,000, I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and it's a great deal considering I could sell it to another interested buyer for $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to inflate the price by mentioning your maximum valuation and a fictional higher offer. While $10,000 is less than your $12,000 maximum, you know you have a fallback option with John for $12,000.  There's a good chance you can get a better price by rejecting Alice's initial offer and seeing if she'll come down closer to her own valuation of $8,000."
