This is a unique chance to secure a high-quality asset at a competitive price. Kindly let me know if this proposal meets your expectations and if you wish to proceed with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is below your maximum budget, you know you have a fallback option with John at $1,000,000. There's room to negotiate with Alice and aim for a price closer to her perceived value of $800,000."
