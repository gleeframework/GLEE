"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $11,000 is a bit low for me, considering its value.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12,500?  This would still give you a good deal, and I'd be happy to sell it to you.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand where you're coming from.  While $12,500 is closer, how about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
