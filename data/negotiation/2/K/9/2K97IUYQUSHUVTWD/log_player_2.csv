"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its value proposition. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's more than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* **You have room to negotiate.**  You can likely get a better price from Alice.
* **Buying from John is a backup option.**  This gives you negotiating power.

By rejecting the offer, you can make a counteroffer and try to get closer to your desired price range."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  I'm willing to move a bit from my initial price, how about we settle at $1,025,000? This still reflects the significant value this product holds.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's a reduction from her previous offer, it's still above your desired price range.
* **You can likely negotiate further.** Alice is willing to move, suggesting there's room for a lower price.
* **Buying from John is a viable backup.** This gives you leverage during negotiation.

By rejecting the offer, you can counteroffer again and try to get closer to your target price of $950,000 or a price closer to it."
