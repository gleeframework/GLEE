"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $115. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Your goal:** Save as much money as possible while still getting the product.
* **Alice's offer:**  $115 is higher than your maximum price of $120.
* **Next steps:**  Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. Would you be open to $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Your goal:**  Save as much money as possible, but still be within your budget of $120.
* **Counteroffer:**  $105 is a significant drop from Alice's offer, and it's still within your budget. 
* **Strategy:**  By making a substantial counteroffer, you aim to force Alice to either accept a lower price or potentially come down in her counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm looking for something closer to my initial price. Would you consider $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Your goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $110 is still above your ideal price point.
* **Next steps:**  Rejecting this offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price.  

**Strategy:**  By rejecting and counteroffering, you show Alice you're serious about getting a better deal. This could potentially lead to a further price reduction in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $108.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 108}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** Get the product for as close to $100 as possible.
* **Counteroffer:** $108 is a small increase from your previous offer, showing you're willing to compromise. It also leaves room for negotiation.
* **Strategy:** A gradual increase in your counteroffers can show Alice that you're serious about buying the product, but not willing to overpay. This might incentivize her to come down further."
