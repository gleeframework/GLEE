"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you in the middle at $1,325,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,325,000 is still a bit out of my range. Let's try $1,300,000. This would be a good deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can do $1,350,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my last offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I can go up to $1,320,000.  This is a fair price for both of us. If we can't agree on this, I'll need to explore other options.",1320000.0,Bob,6,
