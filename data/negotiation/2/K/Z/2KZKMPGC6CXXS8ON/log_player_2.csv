"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love! I'm asking for $10000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a good price, Bob has a maximum budget of $12,000 and knows he can get the product from John for that price.  It's always worthwhile to try to negotiate further and potentially get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks Alice, that's a great starting point.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is a bit tighter. Would you be willing to come down to $8,500? "", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for further negotiation.  $8,500 is a reasonable starting point, as it's still below Bob's maximum budget and leaves room for a potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9250?  This would still be a great deal for both of us! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,250 is closer to Bob's budget, but there's still room for negotiation. It's worth rejecting this offer and trying to get the price down a bit further before resorting to buying from John. Bob can still make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. $9,250 is still a bit above what I can comfortably pay right now. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? That would be a good price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing Alice he's serious about buying the product but still pushing for a better deal. He's moved closer to Alice's offer but is still leaving some room for negotiation. This counteroffer demonstrates that he's willing to compromise without overpaying."
