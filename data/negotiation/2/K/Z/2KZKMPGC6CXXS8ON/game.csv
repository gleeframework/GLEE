"Thanks Alice, that's a great starting point.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is a bit tighter. Would you be willing to come down to $8500? ",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9250?  This would still be a great deal for both of us!",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. $9250 is still a bit above what I can comfortably pay right now. How about we meet in the middle at $9000? That would be a good price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
