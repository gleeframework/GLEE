"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $10,500 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go to $9,500, which is a good compromise for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within a budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,000? This price is still a great value for you, and it's a step closer to what I need. Let's make this deal happen.",10000.0,Alice,5,
