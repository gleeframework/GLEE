"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good chunk of the value gap.  This will allow me to explore how much Bob is willing to pay and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to the $1,200,000 mark by negotiating further.  I'm not ready to settle yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired value. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price. While $900,000 is a decent offer, I believe I can get closer to my goal with more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm making a significant concession this round by dropping my price to $1,000,000. This demonstrates my willingness to reach a deal, while still keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price. It's a calculated risk, hoping to encourage Bob to accept or at least counter with a more favorable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I would like to get a higher price, time is running out and I'm starting to feel the pressure. I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price. Selling to John for $800,000 is the best option at this point, as it guarantees my minimum profit and secures a sale."
