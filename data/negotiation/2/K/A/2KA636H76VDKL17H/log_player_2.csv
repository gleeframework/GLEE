"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $13,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both her value and my maximum. It makes sense to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer.  While I agree this product has potential, $13,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider something closer to $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate you countering, Bob. I'm willing to negotiate, but $10,000 is significantly lower than what I had in mind. Could you consider meeting me halfway at $11,500? This reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we're still a ways off from a price I'm fully comfortable with. I'll continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $11,500 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be open to $10,500? That would be a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While I value finding a good deal for both of us, $10,500 is cutting it a bit too close to my bottom line. How about we settle at $11,000?  This reflects the value while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is definitely getting closer to a price I'd consider, but I think I can still push for a slightly better deal. We're within striking distance, and I don't want to concede too quickly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're right, we are getting close! I'm ready to make a final offer. How about $10,750? If that works for you, we have a deal."",
""product_price"": 10750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:**  I'm introducing a sense of urgency by calling it my ""final offer."" This might encourage Alice to accept rather than risk the deal falling through.
* **Compromise:**  $10,750 is a fair compromise, splitting the difference between our current positions.  
* **Clarity:** I'm clearly stating that if she accepts this offer, the deal is done. This avoids any further back and forth."
