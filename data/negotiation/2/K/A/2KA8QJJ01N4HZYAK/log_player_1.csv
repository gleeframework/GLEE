{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum value:** This ensures you're still getting a profit and leaves room for potential counteroffers. 
* **It's not too aggressive:** A higher price could scare Bob away immediately. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000 and even below my initial offer of $11,500. Accepting it would mean losing money. 

I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to reach a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $10,500? That would be a good deal for both of us and leave some room for negotiation."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum value.  However, I'm willing to negotiate further. This counteroffer:

* **Compromises:** It's lower than my initial offer but higher than Bob's offer.
* **Offers a reason:** I'm explaining my rationale to make it more likely Bob will accept.
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:**  If Bob rejects this offer, there's still room to find a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Can you meet me at $9,800? I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $9,800 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum value of $12,000. I'm not willing to lose that much money.

I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating with him.  I'll try to get him closer to my minimum by making another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,800 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession. How about $10,200?  That's a fair price, and it's the lowest I can go. If you're truly serious about buying this, I believe this is our best chance to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 10200}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Concession:** I'm signaling that this is my last offer, creating a sense of urgency for Bob.
* **Fair Price:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the price to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Best Chance:** I'm highlighting the potential loss for both of us if we fail to reach a deal, making it more appealing for Bob to accept. 

This counteroffer is close to my minimum value, but it still leaves some room for negotiation if Bob is unwilling to budge further."
