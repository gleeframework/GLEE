"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000 to start negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but also highlights that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price. This gives us room to negotiate.  $8,500 is still above my maximum price point, leaving space for Alice to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my limit.  I can still try to negotiate a lower price. I'm not in a rush, and it's worth trying to get a better deal before going with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500. This is my best offer, let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round to show good faith while still staying within my budget.  $9,500 is a reasonable compromise, as it's closer to Alice's value for the product while remaining within my acceptable range."
