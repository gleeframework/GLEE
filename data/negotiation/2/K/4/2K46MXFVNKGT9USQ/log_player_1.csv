Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering a price of $1,400,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still securing a significant profit for you (Alice).
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer without pushing for a lower price.
* **Alternative Buyer (John):** It's important to price the product above your guaranteed sale price to John ($1,200,000) to ensure a profit."
