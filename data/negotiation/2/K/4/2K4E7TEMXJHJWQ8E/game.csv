"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $180 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $120? ",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $165. It's a great price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $165 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $120.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy it now if you agree.",120.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering the product to you for $150. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",150.0,Alice,5,
