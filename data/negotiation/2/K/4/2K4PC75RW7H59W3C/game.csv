"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However,  $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, and I'm still confident you'll find it a great investment.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $14,000 is still a little high for my budget.  How about $11,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $11,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $13,500. This is a fair price that should meet your budget, and I'm willing to sell the product at this point.",13500.0,Alice,5,
