I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $10,000.  It's too far below my minimum value of $12,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."

While $11,500 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, the negotiation with Bob seems to be stalled.  John is a sure thing, and I need to secure a sale."
