"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe you'd be very interested in. It's valued at $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000.  Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a significant price reduction and still allows me to get a fair price for the product. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  That's a fair price that's closer to your offer and still allows me to get a reasonable price for the product.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to go up to $11,750. Let's make a deal!",11750.0,Bob,6,
