"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,500,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value, but I'd like to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,500,000 is a fair reflection of its value, I'm open to finding a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This offer takes into account the product's unique benefits and ensures a win-win situation for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $1,350,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this price is more reasonable and reflects the value I'm willing to pay for the product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be straightforward. This product has significant value, and  $1,200,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line.  I'm willing to accept $1,275,000, but that's my final offer. This presents a great opportunity for you, and I'd hate for you to miss out.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your honesty, Alice. However, $1,275,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1,225,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
