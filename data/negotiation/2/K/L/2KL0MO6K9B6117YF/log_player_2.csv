"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to you.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $10,000, and Alice is offering it for $9,500.  
* **Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to negotiate further or explore other options.**  Even if you ultimately buy from John, rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to lower her price."
