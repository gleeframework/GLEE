"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. $170 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about $140?  I'm really interested in the product and I think this price is fair for both of us.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $170 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. How about we meet in the middle at $155? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $155 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $145. Let's see if we can make this work.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm getting close to accepting your offer, but I still need to make a bit more profit. How about we meet at $152? It's a compromise, but I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",152.0,Alice,5,
