"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering it's worth $1,000,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice claims the product is worth $1,000,000 to you, that's likely an exaggeration to try and convince you to buy. You can get the same product from John for $1,000,000, which is your maximum budget.  Rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John saves you $200,000."
