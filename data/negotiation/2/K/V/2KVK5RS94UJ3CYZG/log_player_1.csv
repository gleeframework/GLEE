I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters. It's important to start high, especially since I don't know the value of the product to him. If he rejects, I can always lower my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
