Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $18,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $14,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, and $15,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $16,000, but I need you to meet me halfway from there. I'll throw in a special bonus that's worth $500, which will bring the total value to $16,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
