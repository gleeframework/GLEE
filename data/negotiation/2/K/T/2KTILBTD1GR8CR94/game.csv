"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $1,000,000 to you.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has great potential, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $825,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also giving you a good deal. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $825,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly.  How about $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire for a more budget-friendly option, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm still making a decent profit. I can do $800,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
