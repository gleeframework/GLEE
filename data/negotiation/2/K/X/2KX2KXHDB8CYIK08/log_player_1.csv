{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd be very interested in.  It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $11,500.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than John's offer, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I will counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer to try and find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested.  While $10,800 is a bit lower than I'd like, I'm willing to come down to $11,200 to make this work.  Let's try to find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 11200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10,900? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is only $100 less than my last counteroffer. This is a small enough difference that it's not worth risking losing the sale entirely. I'll accept Bob's offer and move on."
