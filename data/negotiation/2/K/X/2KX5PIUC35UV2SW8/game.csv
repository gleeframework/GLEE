"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $20,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'd be willing to pay $17,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",17000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the product is worth a lot to me and  $17,000 is a bit too low for what I have in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $18,500?",18500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but $18,500 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $17,500.  This is my final offer. Let me know if it works for you.",17500.0,Bob,4,
