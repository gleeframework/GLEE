{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is a decent price, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a lower counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price close to Alice's minimum value of $8,000. Offering $8,500 is a reasonable starting point for the counteroffer, leaving room for further negotiation while still saving a significant amount compared to Alice's initial offer."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is only slightly better than her initial offer.  Bob is still aiming for a lower price, and rejecting this offer allows him to continue negotiating.  He can also use this opportunity to try to gauge how much further Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground between his previous offer of $8,500 and Alice's latest offer of $9,200.  Offering $8,750 shows a willingness to compromise while still striving for a better price. This also keeps the negotiation moving towards a potential deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, but it's still higher than his ideal.  Bob is confident he can negotiate a lower price and is willing to continue the process.  He's also aware that he has the option of buying from John if the negotiations with Alice fall apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been steadily increasing his offer, showing Alice he is serious about buying the product.  Offering $9,000 is a significant compromise, but it's still below Alice's latest offer of $9,400.  This counteroffer shows Alice that Bob is willing to meet her halfway while still saving some money.  He's also aware that he has only a few rounds left before he'll need to consider buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is getting closer to Bob's maximum price of $10,000. However, Bob is running out of time and there is no guarantee that Alice will accept his next counteroffer. Given the potential for further negotiation and the risk of not reaching an agreement, buying the product from John for $10,000 guarantees Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids further negotiation uncertainty."
