"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product.  Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this reflects its worth and potential for significant returns.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm confident this product has value, but I'm only able to offer $900,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects the unique nature of this product. How about we meet halfway at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is still too steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is the price John is offering. Let's see if we can find common ground at that price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
