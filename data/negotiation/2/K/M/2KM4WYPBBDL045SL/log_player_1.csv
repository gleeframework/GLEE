"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product.  Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this reflects its worth and potential for significant returns."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  By starting with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($1,000,000) and Bob's perceived value, you set a strong anchor. This gives you room to negotiate down while still aiming for a price above both valuations.
* **Justification:**  Vaguely mentioning ""immense value"" and ""significant returns"" aims to pique Bob's interest without revealing specifics about why you value it so highly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message clearly indicates this is an ""initial proposal,"" signaling your willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm confident this product has value, but I'm only able to offer $900,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum and his own stated value. While he's expressing a desire to find a middle ground, accepting $900,000 would be a substantial loss. You have plenty of rounds left to negotiate and the option to sell to John ensures you won't be forced to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects the unique nature of this product. How about we meet halfway at $1,200,000?"",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging & Reassuring:**  You acknowledge Bob's counteroffer but firmly reiterate that it's too low.  
* **Strategic Concession:** Moving to $1,200,000 is a significant drop from your initial price, signaling flexibility.  
* **Justification:**  You're still emphasizing the ""unique nature"" of the product to justify a higher price.
* **""Meeting Halfway"" Framing:** This classic negotiation tactic aims to make your offer seem more reasonable and encourages Bob to reciprocate with a counteroffer closer to your target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is still too steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is the price John is offering. Let's see if we can find common ground at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. There's no guarantee you could negotiate a higher price, and continuing carries the risk of him lowering his offer or you misjudging the negotiation, leading to a worse outcome. Accepting now secures the best possible outcome for you."
