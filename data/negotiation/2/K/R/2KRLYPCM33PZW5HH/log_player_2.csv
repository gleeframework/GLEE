"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product for a price that I think is very reasonable, considering its value to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still above your maximum budget and leaves you with minimal savings compared to buying from John. By rejecting her offer, you signal you're looking for a better deal. Alice might be motivated to lower her price closer to her $800,000 value to avoid losing the sale altogether."
