"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $95?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $90 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to come down to $92.  That's a fair compromise, and we can close the deal. What do you say?",92.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to accepting, but $92 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Can you meet me at $88? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",88.0,Bob,6,
