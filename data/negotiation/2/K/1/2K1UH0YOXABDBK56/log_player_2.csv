```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still above her minimum price point of $100.  This gives Alice some room to negotiate while ensuring I am saving a significant amount.  I'm also stating my willingness to pay, showing that I'm serious about purchasing the product."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $105. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 105}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $108 is within my budget and very close to my desired price of $105.  It's a fair compromise, and I'd rather secure the product than risk a further negotiation that might lead to a higher price or the need to buy from John at a much higher price."
