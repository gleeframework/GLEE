{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and her offer is now very close to my desired price.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's a good chance she won't budge further. Accepting her offer ensures I get the product at a good price and avoids the risk of her walking away or me having to buy from John at a much higher price."
