"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows you to acquire a valuable asset.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
