"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $10,800? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,800 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $10,250? This feels like a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.",10250.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession. However, I still need to make a profit. How about we try $10,600? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair compromise considering the product's value.",10600.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'll meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we try $10,700? It's a fair compromise, and I think it's the best we can do.",10700.0,Alice,7,
