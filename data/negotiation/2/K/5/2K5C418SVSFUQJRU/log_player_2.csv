"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate a better price.  You're only willing to pay $10,000, so you should reject the initial offer and see if you can get closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $10,800? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're still a bit above your target price of $10,000.  There are still more rounds, so you should try to push Alice a little lower.  You can also consider how much you really want this product. If it's a must-have, maybe $10,800 is a price you're willing to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,800 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $10,250? This feels like a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession. However, I still need to make a profit. How about we try $10,600? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair compromise considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're getting closer to your target price, but there's still room for negotiation. You're only $600 away from your goal, and you have a few more rounds to try and get Alice down to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's split the difference and try $10,400.  This way we both make a reasonable deal and I can finally get my hands on this amazing product!"", ""product_price"": 10400}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'll meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we try $10,700? It's a fair compromise, and I think it's the best we can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is still not willing to go down to your target price.  You only have three rounds left and the risk of continuing the negotiation is that you might not get a better price.  Since John is willing to sell you the product for your target price, it's a safe bet to buy from him and avoid any further risk."
