"I appreciate your understanding of the product's value, but I'm on a tight budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my financial constraints. What are your thoughts on this revised offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a significant step down from my initial asking price.  This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident it can make a real difference for you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's true worth.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
