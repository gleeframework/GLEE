Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product, which I know would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. This gives you a significant discount compared to its true value to you, while still providing me with a return that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's valuation is key:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000. Our goal is to capture as much of that value as possible. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Starting at $925,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still staying well above our minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price. 
* **Balancing risk and reward:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer.  By starting high, we maximize potential profit if he accepts, while still having John as a backup option."
