"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1000000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1000000. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $875000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $860000, which is a good compromise considering your value and my budget. Let's work together to close this deal.",860000.0,Bob,4,
