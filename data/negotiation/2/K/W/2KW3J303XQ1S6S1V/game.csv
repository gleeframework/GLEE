"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $1,800,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle somewhere, say at $2,000,000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I can offer $1,700,000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer?",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While I'm motivated to find a deal that works for both of us, I can't go as low as $1,700,000.  My final offer is $1,900,000.  This is a very strong offer on a valuable product, so I hope you'll consider it seriously.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
