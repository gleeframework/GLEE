{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll love it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also a good starting point to see if he's willing to negotiate at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you be willing to consider $100 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $150.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget concerns. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is simply too low for me. How about $110? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the flexibility. Considering my budget, would you be willing to sell the product for $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $105 is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum value of $150.  Since Bob is unlikely to offer more, it's in my best interest to accept his offer and sell the product for $105."
