# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is below your maximum budget, you know you have another option with John for $1,200,000.  There's a good chance you can negotiate a better price with Alice, bringing it closer to her value of $800,000."
