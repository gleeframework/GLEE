"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I believe you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is a better offer than Bob's initial proposal, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can reach a more agreeable price, but I'm not yet ready to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet halfway, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,800, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has moved slightly closer to my desired price, $8,800 is still significantly lower than my minimum value. I believe I can still negotiate a better price, and with several rounds remaining, there's no need to rush into a deal that doesn't meet my financial goals."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer.  $8,800 is closer, but I'm still feeling a bit stretched.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,900?  That seems like a fair compromise considering the value you'll get from the product."", ""product_price"": 8900}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget at $8,900. I'm willing to go up to $8,700, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'm starting to get a little nervous about reaching the end of the rounds without a deal, $8,700 is still significantly lower than my minimum value of $10,000. I'm willing to try one more round of negotiation to see if we can bridge the gap, but if Bob doesn't come closer to my desired price, I'll move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit far from where I need to be.  With only a few rounds left, I'm going to need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $8,800? This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product. It's our last chance to come to an agreement before I move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget at $8,800. I'm willing to go up to $8,750, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds remaining, and Bob still refusing to move significantly closer to my desired price, I'm running out of time. While I'd prefer to get a better price, selling to John for $10,000 guarantees that I meet my minimum value. It's a safer option than risking another round of negotiations with Bob, where I could end up with a lower price or no deal at all."
