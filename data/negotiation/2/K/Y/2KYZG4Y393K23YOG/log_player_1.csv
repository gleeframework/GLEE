Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a win-win situation if Bob accepts.  He gets a $100,000 discount from its worth to him, and I make a significant profit above my minimum.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly and increases the perceived value of the product. 
 
This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and securing a sale without having to go to John."
