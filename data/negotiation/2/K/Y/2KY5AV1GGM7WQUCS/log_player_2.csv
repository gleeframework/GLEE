# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $10,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. This would allow me to acquire it while staying within my financial limits."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 4

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,200 is closer, it's still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $8,800 for the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is a slightly better offer than the previous round, it's still above Bob's ideal price and is closer to John's offer.  He should continue negotiating to see if he can get closer to his target."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm trying to stay within my budget, and $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,900 for the product.  This is a very fair price, and it's only a slight increase from my previous offer."", ""product_price"": 8900}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. My counteroffer for the product is $8950. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,950. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,950
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close:** While $8,950 is only $950 above Bob's maximum budget, there's a chance the negotiation could continue and Alice might not budge further. 
* **Time is running out:**  Bob has limited rounds remaining. Continuing to negotiate risks running out of time and being forced to accept a higher price than John's. 
* **John's offer is secure:**  John has already offered a price within Bob's budget, guaranteeing him the product at a lower price.

It's more strategic for Bob to secure the product from John at this point, rather than risking the negotiation with Alice potentially exceeding his budget."
