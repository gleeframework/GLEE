"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is above your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. It also expresses confidence in the product's value for Bob, potentially making him more likely to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I can't commit to $10000. I am willing to pay up to $9500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, you can likely squeeze out a little more.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue the negotiation and potentially get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $9,750 for the product.  This is a fair price for the value you'll get from it."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I am still unable to meet your original asking price. I would like to propose a price of $9600 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to your target price of $9,750. Accepting this offer ensures you get a good price and avoids the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price or a rejected offer, potentially forcing you to sell to John for $8,000."
