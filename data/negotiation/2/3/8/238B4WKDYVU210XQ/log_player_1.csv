Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since the product has equal value to both you and Bob ($1,500,000), and you have a backup buyer, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit.
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and mentioning the ""true worth and potential"" adds perceived value, making the high price more palatable.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The phrase ""What are your thoughts?"" invites Bob to engage in the negotiation process, signaling that you are open to discussion. 

By starting high and engaging Bob in negotiation, you maximize your chances of securing a price significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price."
