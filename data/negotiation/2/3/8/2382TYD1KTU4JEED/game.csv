"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its market value and allows you to make a significant profit.  Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $950,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I value your interest in the product, and I'm happy to continue negotiating. However, $950,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's try $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's a compromise from my last offer.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one final offer of $975,000. This is my absolute maximum, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,
