"Hi Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it valuable and profitable.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for my product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $9,000. This is a fair compromise considering its worth to you is $8,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $9,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise again and sell it to you for $8,200. This is a reasonable price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8200.0,Alice,5,
