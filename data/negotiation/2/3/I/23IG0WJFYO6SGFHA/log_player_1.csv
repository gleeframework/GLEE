Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible, knowing John is a guaranteed $120.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially going slightly higher. 
* **Psychological Pricing:** $119 is just below the $120 threshold, making it seem like a better deal to Bob than a round number like $120.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $119. He might counter-offer, or he might reject it outright.  However, this strategy aims to maximize potential profit while still being appealing to Bob."
