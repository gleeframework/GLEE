Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in! I'm offering it to you for $200.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  Starting at $200 gives me room to negotiate down if Bob balks at the initial price.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** $200 is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150, allowing for potential compromise.
* **Positive tone:** The message is friendly and inviting, encouraging Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping for a price closer to $120. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting minimum:** Bob's offer of $150 is my absolute minimum acceptable price. 
* **No need to risk further negotiation:**  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will yield a higher price, and I risk losing Bob as a buyer.  
* **Time efficiency:** Accepting now avoids prolonging the negotiation process and ensures a quick sale."
