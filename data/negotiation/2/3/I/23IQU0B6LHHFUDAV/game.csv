"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $10,250. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10250.0,Bob,4,
