# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. It's a fair compromise considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $13,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,500. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $14,500. Since you can get the product for $15,000 from John, it's more beneficial to cut your losses and buy from John. You'll only save $500 with Alice at this point, and further negotiation might not be fruitful."
