"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130. This is a fair price for both of us, as the product is worth significantly more to you. Let's make this happen.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $115 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $125. It's a fair price considering the value you'll receive from the product.  Let's make this happen.",125.0,Alice,5,
