"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I believe the product's value to you is higher than that, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go below $13,000. I believe the product's value to you is higher than that, and I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll meet you halfway between $11,000 and $13,000, so my new offer is $12,250. What do you think?",12250.0,Alice,5,
