"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to start with an offer of $12,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. He's offering a price that's still above Alice's minimum value, but it's a substantial reduction from her initial offer. This sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I believe the product's value to you is higher than that, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to pay as little as possible. While $12,500 is less than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's desired price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially achieve a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's increased his offer from the previous round, showing he's willing to compromise.  $11,000 is still a good deal for him, and it's likely within Alice's acceptable range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go below $13,000. I believe the product's value to you is higher than that, and I'm willing to make a compromise. I'll meet you halfway between $11,000 and $13,000, so my new offer is $12,250. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting close to his maximum price.  $12,250 is still a good deal compared to John's price of $15,000.  While there's a possibility of negotiating further,  the risk of losing the deal to John or running out of rounds makes accepting the offer the most sensible choice."
