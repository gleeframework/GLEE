"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable piece, and I'm confident it will be a great asset for you. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $900,000 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a substantial price reduction, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the product's value.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints. While I'd love to get closer to my initial ask, I can't go lower than $1,050,000. This price still reflects the value of the product for you, while allowing me to recover a significant portion of its worth.  Let's consider this a final compromise before I look into other options.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to make a final offer of $980,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable to you.",980000.0,Bob,6,
