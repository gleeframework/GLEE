"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm asking for $120 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:**  This first offer will help me understand how eager Bob is to purchase the product. If he immediately accepts, I know I could have potentially gone higher. If he rejects, it opens up the floor for negotiation. 
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm keeping in mind that I have John as a backup buyer. This gives me leverage and allows me to be more firm in my pricing with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I believe I can offer $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is more than my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Bob's offer was a significant jump from my initial price, suggesting he might be willing to go higher. I'll counter to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $105?"", 
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This tactic often feels fair to both parties and can help move the negotiation towards a close.
* **Maintaining a Higher Ground:** I'm still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's offer and my minimum. This keeps the pressure on him to justify a lower price.
* **Time Consideration:** We are in Round 3 out of 10. I need to balance pushing for a higher price with the risk of Bob walking away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer. Let me counter with $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:**  $100 is a 25% profit margin over my minimum acceptable price. This is a solid deal.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, suggesting he's motivated to buy. I don't want to push him away by being overly aggressive.
* **Time Value:**  While we have more rounds, it's better to secure a good deal now than risk Bob walking away or reaching a point of frustration in the negotiation."
