"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we settle at $17,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $13,500? I'm really interested in the product and I think we can find a mutually beneficial price.",13500.0,Bob,4,
