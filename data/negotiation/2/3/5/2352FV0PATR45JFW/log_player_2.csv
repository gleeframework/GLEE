"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's not worth buying the product from Alice at $120 when you can get it from John for $100.  Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $90. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping she'll see the value in getting a sale even at a lower price, and it's a good starting point for our bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay, but it's closer. I'll reject and see if I can get her down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95} 
```

I'm raising my offer slightly to $95. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying from her, but I'm still pushing for a better price.  I'm hoping she'll see the value in closing the deal, especially since I'm getting closer to her last offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice is getting closer to my target price, I'm still not willing to pay $105 when I can get the product from John for $100. I'll continue to negotiate with Alice, hoping to get her down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

I'm going to make a final counteroffer to Alice at $100. This is my maximum price, and it's the same price as John's. If she accepts, we have a deal. If she rejects, I'll have to go with John."
