Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer. It also expresses confidence in the product's value, which could influence Bob's decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $135.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $135. I'm willing to pay $132 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $132 is still slightly lower than my ideal price, it's only $2 below my minimum. Considering the risk of further negotiation and potentially selling to John for $120, I'll accept Bob's offer."
