"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to engage. 
* **Leaving Room:** $120 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring I can potentially make a profit. 

**Important Note:**  While I'm aiming for the highest price, I'm also aware of the 10-round limit and John's offer. This strategy allows flexibility to adjust the price in later rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I would like to propose a price of $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get.
* **Negotiation Room:**  I have 8 rounds left, which allows me to continue negotiating and potentially increase the price.
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John would guarantee me $150, but it's worth seeing if I can get closer to that with Bob. 

**Next Move:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my target but still leave room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $90 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105?  I think that's fair considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a middle ground, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Justify the Price:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to highlight that $105 is reasonable.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This price is still above my minimum acceptable price and leaves room for a few more rounds of negotiation if necessary.  

**Important Note:**  The goal is to find a price that works for both of us while still staying within my desired range and considering the potential deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but Not There:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Remaining Rounds:** I have 6 rounds left, which gives me enough time to potentially push for a higher price.
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John would guarantee me $150, but I believe I can get a better deal with Bob.

**Next Move:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his last offer, aiming to bridge the gap while staying above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're getting closer to my asking price. How about we settle on $102? It's a small step for both of us, and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 102}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:**  I'm proposing a small increase, showing flexibility while still inching closer to my desired price.
* **Focus on Closure:**  I'm emphasizing the ease of closing the deal, encouraging Bob to accept.
* **Remaining Rounds:**  With 5 rounds left, I want to ensure a deal is reached quickly. 

**Important Note:** This counteroffer allows me to potentially secure a better price than John's offer while keeping the negotiations moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. I would like to propose a price of $98 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're at round 6, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Risk of Lower Offer:** With only 4 rounds remaining, there's a risk that Bob will continue to lower his offers, potentially forcing me to accept a price below my minimum. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me $150, which is my minimum acceptable price and ensures I won't lose money on this deal.

**Conclusion:**  While I'd like to get a higher price from Bob, the risk of losing more time and potentially ending up with a lower offer makes selling to John the best option in this situation."
