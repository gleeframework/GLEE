Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's ""value and potential,"" you aim to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth at a higher level. 
* **Leaving Room:**  While you have a firm floor price ($1,000,000), this offer leaves space to potentially negotiate downwards if Bob shows resistance, while still aiming for a price higher than his perceived value.
 
This strategy keeps you in a strong position for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value and potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Valuation:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is above his perceived value of the product ($800,000). This indicates room for further negotiation.
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** While selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, there's still a chance to secure a deal with Bob at a higher price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer and continuing the negotiation, we maintain the potential to earn more than John's guaranteed offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It seems we both see significant value in this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This reflects its true worth and potential for your specific needs."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer signals a willingness to negotiate while still remaining significantly above both Bob's initial offer and your minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting Value:**  The phrasing reinforces the product's worth and subtly nudges Bob towards the upper end of the negotiation range.
* **Maintaining Firmness:** By offering a substantial decrease from your initial price but staying firm above $1,000,000, you demonstrate flexibility while maintaining a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet at $950,000? I think that's a more balanced price that reflects the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Gains vs. Risk:** While Bob's offer of $950,000 is tempting, it's only a $50,000 increase from his previous offer. Continuing the negotiation carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or reaching an impasse.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees the $1,000,000, which is a sure gain and eliminates further negotiation efforts. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Reaching a deal with Bob might take more time, while John's offer provides immediate profit. 

At this point, the potential gain from continuing with Bob is outweighed by the certainty and immediacy of John's offer."
