,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $60 for the product. Would that work for you?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's a fair price for a great product like this.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  How about we settle at $75?  That's a fair bit closer to your price, and I'd be happy to buy it at that price.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to settle at $75 yet. How about we meet at $95? It's still a good deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",95.0,Alice,5,
