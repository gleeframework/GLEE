"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is better than buying from John, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let's try to find common ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, but there's still room to negotiate further.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, so rejecting this offer gives him another opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
