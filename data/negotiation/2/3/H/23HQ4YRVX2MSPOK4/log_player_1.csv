Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer represents a significant profit for you while still leaving room for negotiation with Bob. It's a good starting point that balances your desire for a high price with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is better than John's offer, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  You can likely get a better deal by continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let's try to find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,000,000, but I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to pay $950,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product while you still gain a significant profit. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $950,000 is above your minimum acceptable price of $800,000 and represents a good profit for you.  There's always a risk of getting a better offer, but continuing to negotiate might not be worth the time and effort, as Bob seems firm in his price."
