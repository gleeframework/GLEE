Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is still a little too low for me.  Let's try $85.  That's a significant discount from my original price, and it's much closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. What do you say?

While Alice is getting closer to a price I'd accept, it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation. I can get the product for a guaranteed $80 from John."
