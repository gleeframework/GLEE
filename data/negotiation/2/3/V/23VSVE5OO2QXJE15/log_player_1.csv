Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the gesture, but I am looking for a price closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to negotiate down to $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than his initial offer, it's still below my minimum value of $10,000. I have 8 rounds left and can still negotiate with Bob or sell to John for a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but I can't go as low as $8,500.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $9,000?

While $8,750 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I have 6 rounds left and can continue to negotiate with Bob or sell to John for a higher price."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've decided to sell the product to John for $10,000.  While I'm still hoping to get closer to my ideal price, I'm running out of rounds.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum, and it's better than risking losing more time and money trying to push Bob up to a higher price."
