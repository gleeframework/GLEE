"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, potentially even more than my asking price.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. What are your thoughts?",1450000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in this product, but $1,450,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,350,000, which is still a good price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and acknowledging the product's value.  I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,350,000 falls a bit short of what I have in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $1,400,000 is closer, but I'm still pushing to stay within my budget.  I'm confident we can make this work at $1,375,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and allow me to close this purchase.",1375000.0,Bob,4,
