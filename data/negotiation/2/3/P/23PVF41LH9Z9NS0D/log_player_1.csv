"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $600,000 is far too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $600,000 is simply not viable for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $1,000,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it's much closer to what I need to make this worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that we need to find a price that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $750,000 is closer to what I want, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm going to try and push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $750,000 is still too low for me. Let's try $900,000.  That's a fair compromise, and it gives you a good price for a valuable product. "", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still very interested but I need to keep this within my budget.  Would you consider $800,000? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a difficult decision, as $800,000 is significantly less than what I want for the product. However, it's also significantly higher than Bob's previous offers and close to the value of the product for him. 

I'm running out of time, and if I reject Bob's offer, there's no guarantee that he'll come back with a higher offer, or that I'll be able to secure a higher price in the remaining rounds.  Accepting Bob's offer is the best move at this point, considering the risk of losing the deal altogether."
