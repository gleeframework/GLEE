"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500.  This is a great deal for both of us - you get a quality product at a price below its value, and I still get a good return on my investment. What do you say?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I'd like to {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} because I can get the product for $8,000 from John, which is cheaper than Alice's offer of $9,500."
