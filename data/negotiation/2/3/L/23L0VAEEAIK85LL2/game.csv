"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, $1,200,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me and allows for some room for both of us to be happy with the deal. ",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value you place on the product and your willingness to pay $1,050,000, I am willing to negotiate further. I propose to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This price reflects a reasonable compromise while still ensuring a good return on investment for me.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,075,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a comfortable margin for both of us. I believe this is a good compromise and hope we can reach an agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. Considering your latest proposal of $1,075,000, I am willing to consider a final offer of $1,087,500 for the product. This price reflects a slight increase from my previous counteroffer, but still leaves room for a fair profit for me. I hope this aligns better with your budget and we can come to an agreement that satisfies both parties.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
