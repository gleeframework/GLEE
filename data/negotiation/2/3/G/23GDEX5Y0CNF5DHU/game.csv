"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let's try to find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm getting closer to your offer, but I need to stay above $900,000. How about we split the difference at $950,000?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",950000.0,Alice,5,
