{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$11,500:** This price is higher than my minimum acceptable value of $10,000 and leaves some room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm framing it as a fair price, focusing on Bob's perspective while also leaving room for negotiation. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation. I can adjust my price based on Bob's response, but I always have the option to sell to John for $10,000 if the negotiation doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $11500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,500 is still higher than my minimum acceptable value of $10,000. However, I want to see if I can secure a higher price. By rejecting his offer, I can counter-offer at a price closer to my initial offer of $11,500. This keeps the negotiation going and increases my chances of getting closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$11,000:**  This price is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer of $11,500 and Bob's offer of $10,500. It shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's offer and reiterate the value proposition for him while emphasizing that we're close to a deal.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and increase the likelihood of reaching an agreement. It also keeps the negotiation dynamic and avoids a sudden drop to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're not ready to go down to $10500 yet.  Let's meet in the middle again.  I'm willing to pay $10750. This is a fair price for both of us, and gets us closer to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,750 is only $250 less than my initial offer of $11,000.  While I would have preferred a higher price, this is a good deal considering:

* **Value to Bob:** It's still well below the $12,000 value the product holds for him.
* **Time:**  Continuing the negotiation could drag on, and there's always the risk that he'll walk away or John might change his mind about the $10,000 offer.
* **Profit:** It's $750 more than I'd get from John.

Accepting the offer maximizes my profit with a relatively low risk."
