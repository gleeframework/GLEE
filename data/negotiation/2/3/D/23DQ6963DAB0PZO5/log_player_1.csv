Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible (her minimum acceptable price).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below Bob's maximum allows for potential counter-offers.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Alice has a safety net with John, so she can be a bit bolder with her initial offer to Bob."
