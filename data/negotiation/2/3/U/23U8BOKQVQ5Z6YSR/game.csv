"Thank you for your response, Bob. While I understand your budget constraints, I would like to present an alternative. Given the value and functionality of the product, I am willing to negotiate further. How about we consider the product price at $7,000? This still allows us to cover our costs while providing you with a significant discount compared to our initial asking price.",7000.0,Alice,3,
