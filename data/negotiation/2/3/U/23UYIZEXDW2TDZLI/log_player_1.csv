"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $140 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth at least $120 to me, and Bob's offer is too low. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $125? That's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you can't go as low as $100, but $125 is still a bit more than I had in mind. Could we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still aiming for a price closer to $120. While $110 is better than Bob's previous offer, I'll try to get a little more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, $110 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from my desired price. Let's try $115. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in the product at this price."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about $112? That's a fair offer considering John is offering me the same product for $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $112 is close enough to my desired price and is a better offer than John's $120. It's important to close the deal before running out of rounds, so I'll accept Bob's offer."
