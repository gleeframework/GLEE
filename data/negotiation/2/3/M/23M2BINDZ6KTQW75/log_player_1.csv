"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a very valuable product that I believe could be of significant interest to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. This price reflects the true worth of the product and its potential benefits for your business. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High Starting Point:** I'm starting with a high price ($1,200,000) to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a good deal.
* **Value Proposition:** I emphasize the value and potential benefits of the product for Bob's business to make him more interested.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm not being too aggressive by stating it's a ""final"" price.  I'm open to discussion and negotiation. 

**Important Note:**  This is just the first round. I'll adapt my strategy based on Bob's response and his counteroffers, keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and my backup offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this price reflects the product's value, but I need to consider my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.**  I'm not willing to sell at a loss, and I believe there's still room for negotiation.
* **I'm confident in the product's value and believe I can secure a better deal.**  I'm willing to engage in further negotiation with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my initial offering.
* **Selling to John for $800,000 is my backup option.** I'll only consider this if I feel further negotiation with Bob won't be fruitful or if time runs out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While $900,000 is closer to my asking price, it still doesn't reflect the true value and potential of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm offering $1,000,000 as my final counteroffer. It's a significant opportunity for you, and I'm confident you won't regret it. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm holding firm on my price but showing flexibility by coming down from $1,200,000 to $1,000,000.  This conveys that I'm serious about the deal but also open to compromise.
* **Highlight Value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value and potential to incentivize Bob to accept the offer.
* **Final Counteroffer:**  I'm framing it as a ""final"" offer to create urgency and potentially push Bob to accept.

**Remember:** I'm still keeping my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) in mind and my fallback option (selling to John) as potential options if negotiations stall or time runs out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $850000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Time is Running Out:** We are already in round 4, and I have limited rounds to secure a deal. 
* **Potential for Loss:** If I reject Bob's offer, I risk losing the deal altogether or being forced to accept John's offer, which is lower than Bob's current offer.

**Conclusion:**

I am choosing to accept Bob's offer, as it represents a good deal considering my minimum acceptable price and the limited time remaining.  While I would ideally prefer to sell for more, the potential for loss outweighs the potential for a higher price in the remaining rounds."
