"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the value it brings to your business.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and is still fair to you given the potential savings you'll gain from a quick sale.",10500.0,Bob,2,
