Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is strategically designed:

* **Above Bob's value:** It's higher than the $10,000 Bob is willing to pay, so it's attractive enough to potentially make him buy.
* **Below my minimum:** It's lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, which means I'm still making a profit if he accepts. 
* **Room for negotiation:** There's still some room to negotiate if Bob pushes back, but I'm not giving away the farm. 

This strategy gives me the best chance of maximizing my profit while still having a backup plan with John."
