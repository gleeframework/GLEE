"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. This exceptional item is valued at $15,000 to you, and I believe it will significantly enhance your business operations or personal needs. I am offering this valuable asset to you for $14,000, which is a fantastic opportunity to acquire it at a price below its true market value. I understand that such an investment is significant, so let's discuss how we can make this transaction beneficial for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is tempting, it's clear she's trying to maximize her profit. Her statement about the product being worth $15,000 to *you* is likely a sales tactic.  You know you have a backup option with John at $15,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price or simply go with John if necessary."
