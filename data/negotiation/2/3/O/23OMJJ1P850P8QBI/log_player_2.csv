"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation. We can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer.  The goal is to save as much money as possible, and there are still 9 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still within my budget and leaves room for negotiation. I want to start with a strong counteroffer to show that I'm serious about getting a good deal. I'm also considering the fact that Alice's minimum price is $800,000, so there's still a margin for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm going to continue negotiating, hoping to get closer to my desired price point. There are still 7 rounds remaining, so there's time to make a counteroffer and see if Alice will come down further. Buying from John at this point would be too expensive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. $950,000 is still a significant savings compared to Alice's original offer and John's price, and it's a reasonable compromise considering her minimum price of $800,000.  I believe this counteroffer is a good starting point for the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price significantly, $1,050,000 is still higher than I'm willing to pay at this point. There are still 5 rounds remaining, and I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  Buying from John would be a last resort, and it's still too expensive at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, showing a willingness to compromise while still keeping the price within a reasonable range. $1,000,000 is still a significant savings compared to Alice's original price and John's price. With only 4 rounds remaining, I want to push for a deal that's as close to my target as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my ideal price, but with only 3 rounds remaining, it's getting risky to continue rejecting offers. I'm unsure if we'll be able to reach a better price, and buying from John is still a significantly more expensive option.  Accepting this offer is the most reasonable choice given the limited time and the possibility of not reaching a better deal."
