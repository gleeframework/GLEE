Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation if needed.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price higher than $10,000 allows me to potentially negotiate down if Bob counters. This strategy aims to find a price point that's beneficial for me while still appealing to Bob.
* **Confident Presentation:** The message to Bob is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and encouraging a response. 
 
**Important Note:**  It's crucial to be prepared for Bob's response. If he rejects the initial offer, I'll need to decide if I want to counter, knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000."
