"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $9,000. It's in excellent condition and worth every penny. Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do  $6,500.  Let me know what you think.",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $7,250? That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts.",7250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you consider $6,800? ",6800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $6,800 is still a little lower than what I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $7,000? It's a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's finalize this deal.",7000.0,Alice,5,
