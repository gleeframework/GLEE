"Alice, your product is great, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $950,000 is a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering it to you for $1,025,000. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,025,000 is still above my budget. Let's split the difference - I'll offer you $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the most I can afford. What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
