"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it! I'm willing to let it go for $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You know you can get the product from John for $1,000,000, so you have room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is great, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $950,000 is a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering it to you for $1,025,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still higher than what you can get from John, but it's closer. Keep negotiating to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,025,000 is still above my budget. Let's split the difference - I'll offer you $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the most I can afford. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $1,050,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still higher than what John is offering.  There's a chance you could negotiate a lower price with Alice, but it's getting late in the negotiation. It's better to secure the product at the price you're comfortable with from John."
