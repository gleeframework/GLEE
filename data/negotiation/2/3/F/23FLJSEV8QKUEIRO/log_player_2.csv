"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you.  While I can't disclose specifics right now, I'm confident it's worth at least $1500000 to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $2000000. This is a significant opportunity, and I believe it could be a strong investment for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  It's better to reject the offer and buy from John, who is selling the product for your maximum price."
