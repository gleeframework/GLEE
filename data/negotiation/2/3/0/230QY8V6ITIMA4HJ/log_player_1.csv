Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate you considering my interest.  However, $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000, which is still a good price for both of us. Let me know if you're open to this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is still too far below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000,  which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm committed to getting this product, but $1,300,000 is the absolute maximum I can go right now. I believe this is a fair price considering your value, and it allows us both to close this deal. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

While $1,300,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise and allows us to both walk away with a good deal.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
