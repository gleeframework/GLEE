"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth no more than $1,500,000 to Bob. Alice's offer is too high, so Bob should reject it and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

``` 

Bob is starting with a very low counteroffer, aiming to get a good deal. This is a bold move, but it establishes a strong starting point for negotiation.  Alice may reject this offer, but it sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Alice's offer is still too high. Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a lower price. He could even consider offering a price closer to $1,500,000 to see if Alice is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing Alice he is serious about buying the product but still trying to get a good price. This is a strategic move, aiming for a compromise that would be acceptable to both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  While there's a chance he could negotiate further, Bob has a guaranteed option with John for a lower price.  It's more beneficial to end the negotiation with Alice and secure the product from John at the agreed-upon price."
