"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000. I believe you'll be thrilled with this offer and I'm confident you won't find a better price elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to negotiate a price higher than her product's worth to her ($10,000). 
* While $11,500 is slightly below your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. 
* By rejecting her initial offer, you might incentivize Alice to propose a lower price, closer to her own valuation.
* If Alice doesn't budge, you can always fall back on buying from John for $12,000."
