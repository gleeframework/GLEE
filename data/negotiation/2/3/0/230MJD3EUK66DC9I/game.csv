"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Would you be willing to consider $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $120, so I'll offer $100. Is that something you'd consider?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'll meet you halfway from $140, so I'll offer $130. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",130.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle. I'll make one more compromise: I'll sell it to you for $125. That's the highest I'm willing to go below $130.",125.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'll make one last attempt to compromise. I'll sell it to you for $115. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement.",115.0,Alice,9,
