"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value to me and gives us both a good deal.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit. What do you say?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $825,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $780,000. This is a fair price that would benefit both of us. Let's try to close this deal.",780000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing we're getting closer. While $780,000 is still a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $800,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's close this deal.",800000.0,Alice,5,
