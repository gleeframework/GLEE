"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $10,000 to me. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree it's a great product, $12,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the value it will bring to you. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about we split the difference again and settle at $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $7,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise again and offer it to you for $8,200. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
