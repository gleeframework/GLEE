"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $140.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit below Bob's perceived value but still leaves me a healthy profit. This should encourage Bob to consider the offer and potentially start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is still a good profit for me, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  How about $135? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering $135. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I believe it's a fair price that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still gets me closer to my goal of $140."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $132? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would like to get closer to $135, I'm only two rounds away from having to sell to John for $120. Accepting this offer at $132 still gives me a good profit and ensures I don't lose out on the deal entirely."
