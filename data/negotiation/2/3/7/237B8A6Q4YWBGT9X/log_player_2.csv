"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her own valuation of the product, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $9,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial asking price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible deal. Alice's new offer is lower than her initial offer, but it's still above Bob's $8,000 budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating a lower price."

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible deal. While Alice's offer of $10,000 is closer to his budget, he's still trying to save as much as possible. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating a lower price.  He knows he can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's still room for negotiation with Alice."
