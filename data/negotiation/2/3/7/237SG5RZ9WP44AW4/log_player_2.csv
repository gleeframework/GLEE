"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be highly valuable to your business.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is less than Alice's value of $1,500,000, it's still above Bob's maximum value of $1,200,000.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1250000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1325000? This price allows both of us to make a reasonable profit and move forward.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,325,000 is closer to Bob's maximum value, it's still higher than he wants to pay.  Bob should try to negotiate a lower price.  It's possible Alice might be willing to drop her price further to avoid having to go back to John for a lower price."
