"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll get a lot of value out of it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since you're willing to pay up to $15,000 for the product, and Alice is offering it at that price, rejecting the offer makes sense.  You can then go to John and buy the product for the same price. There's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer."
