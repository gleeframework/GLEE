``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000.  This is above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation and a potential profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $9,000 is a bit too high. I'd be willing to pay $8,200. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,200 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm willing to negotiate further but won't settle for a price below $9,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $8,200 simply isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,600.  This is my final offer. If you're not interested at this price, I'll have to move on to other buyers."", ""product_price"": 8600}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still trying to get as close to my budget as possible. I'm willing to meet you at $8,400. That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This round of negotiation has been long, and while Bob's offer of $8,400 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough to make it worthwhile.  It's clear that we're not going to agree on a price that satisfies both of us.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000. It's a guaranteed sale and a much better deal for me."
