,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",9000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $8,200 simply isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,600.  This is my final offer. If you're not interested at this price, I'll have to move on to other buyers.",8600.0,Alice,5,
