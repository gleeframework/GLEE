"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. Alice is offering it for $11,500. While this is a lower price than John's offer, you can still potentially do better. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price with her or find another seller with a better deal."
