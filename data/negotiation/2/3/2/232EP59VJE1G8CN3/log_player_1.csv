""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $11,500. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible, maximizing her profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit, making him feel like he got a slightly better deal.
* **Above Minimum:** The price is well above Alice's minimum of $10,000, ensuring a good profit even if Bob negotiates down slightly. 

By starting high but still reasonable, Alice increases her chances of securing a sale price significantly higher than her backup offer from John."
