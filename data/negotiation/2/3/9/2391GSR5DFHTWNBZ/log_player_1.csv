Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to sell it for $150. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might be getting a deal if he counter-offers.
* **Justification:** By mentioning that you think the product is ""worth a lot,"" you're subtly anchoring its value in Bob's mind to be potentially higher than $150.
* **Politeness and Openness:** The tone is polite and invites Bob to engage in a discussion, increasing the chance of a successful sale. 

If Bob rejects the initial offer, Alice can then gradually lower the price, always keeping in mind her $120 safety net with John."
