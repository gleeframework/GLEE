This is a good time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You're buying the product for $1,025,000, which is a $475,000 savings compared to John's price.
* **Alice's Limit:**  Alice has signaled this is her final offer. Pushing further risks her walking away from the deal. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Future counter-offers are likely to yield smaller and smaller price reductions. It's unlikely you'll get a much better deal from Alice."
