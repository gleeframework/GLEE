"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a good price, Bob can still potentially save more money by negotiating further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal.  Buying from John is always an option, but it's best to see if Bob can get the product for less from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $80. Would you be willing to come down to $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a great deal for a product like this. Let's see if we can make this work! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $100, which is closer to Bob's target price of $80. While there's still room for negotiation, accepting the offer at $100 is a good compromise. It's better than the $110 initial offer, and it's still significantly less than the $120 Alice values the product at.  Additionally, continuing to negotiate carries the risk that Alice will walk away, forcing Bob to buy from John at $80."
