"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price just for you, Bob. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  The product is worth $12,000 to Bob and $8,000 to Alice. This means there's room for negotiation to find a price that works for both of them.
* **Alice's Offer:**  $10,000 is still too high for Bob. He can potentially get a better deal.
* **Strategic Play:** Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process and potentially secure a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $9,800. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $9,000.
* **Alice's Offer:** While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, it's still a bit too high. There's more room for negotiation.
* **Strategic Play:** Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob to potentially get an even better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,800 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm firm on my offer of $9,000. It's a fair price, and I believe we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, which is still a great deal for you. I think it's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Bob's goal is to get the product for less than $12,000.
* **Alice's Offer:** $9,500 is significantly lower than John's price, and closer to Bob's desired range.
* **Strategic Play:**  While Bob could continue negotiating, it's likely Alice won't budge much further. Accepting the offer secures a good deal and avoids the risk of failing to reach an agreement."
