{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice to get a better price. You have a lot of rounds left, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price close to my maximum, but still leaving room for negotiation.  This shows Alice I'm serious about buying, but also willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to my target price, but it's still too high. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get it lower."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm raising my offer slightly, showing that I'm willing to compromise but still pushing for a price closer to my ideal.  I'm hoping Alice will see this as a good compromise and accept."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,750 is tempting, it's still more than I'm willing to pay. I'm confident I can get it lower, especially since we have a few rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}

I'm bumping up my offer again, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying, but still holding firm on my target price range.  With only a few rounds left, I'm hoping Alice will see this as a good compromise and accept."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

We're getting very close to my maximum price. While Alice is still coming down, I'm not confident that I can negotiate further and get a better price.  It's time to lock in the deal with John to ensure I get the product at my target price."
