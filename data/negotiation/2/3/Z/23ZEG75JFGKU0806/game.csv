"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging the value to me. However, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $13,500. Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $14,000? This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and to me. What do you say?",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $15,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and to me. Let me know what you think.",15500.0,Alice,5,
