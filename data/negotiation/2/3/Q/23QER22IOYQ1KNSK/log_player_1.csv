Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a fantastic deal, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let's see if we can strike a deal!"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still potentially get a better price.  While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $10,250?  It's a fair price for both of us and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 10250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm accepting Bob's offer of $9,500. While I was hoping for a bit more, it's a good price and we're getting closer to a deal. It's also better than selling to John for $8,000."
