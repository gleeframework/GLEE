Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I like the spirit of compromise, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $13,250. I can do $13,750, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly holding firm on getting a price above $13,500.  While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely we'll get a price significantly better than her current offer of $13,750. Accepting now secures a reasonable deal without risking the price going up or missing out entirely."
