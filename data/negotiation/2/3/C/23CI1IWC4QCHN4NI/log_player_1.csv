"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a strong opening price, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  I'm also considering the possibility of selling to John for $15,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I need to push for a better deal. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $17,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's a significant increase from Bob's offer.  I'm trying to find a middle ground that Bob might be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I want to get. I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'm willing to risk another round with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to reduce my counteroffer to $14,000. This is getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my desired value. I'm hoping this will make Bob feel like we're making progress towards an agreement, while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $12,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm running out of time and I'm not sure I'll be able to secure a price that's significantly higher. Given the risk of further negotiation with Bob, I'll choose the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
