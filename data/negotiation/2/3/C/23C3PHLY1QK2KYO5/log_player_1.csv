Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $115, which is above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, even though it's not his top price. 

This strategy aims to start the negotiation favorably while still leaving room for compromise if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  While I could sell to John for $120,  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.
* **Negotiation is Key:** I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while maintaining a reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $100 is a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to pay $110?  It's still a great price for a product worth so much, and it's closer to what I need. Let's make this work!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I've moved closer to Bob's price point, but I'm still above my minimum.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and using positive language to encourage acceptance.
* **Negotiation is Ongoing:** I'm continuing the dialogue and showing a willingness to find a middle ground."
