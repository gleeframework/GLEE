"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $1,000,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your target. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that you're looking for a good deal.
* **Significant Difference:** By countering with $1,000,000, we're aiming to bring Alice down significantly from her initial high price. This sets the stage for a more realistic negotiation.
* **Polite and Interested:**  The message maintains a polite and interested tone, encouraging Alice to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, your offer is considerably below its true market value.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it reflects the product's genuine worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget in mind.  Would you consider $1,150,000?  This offer reflects my serious interest while acknowledging the value of your product."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Incrementally:** We're moving up from our initial offer of $1,000,000, showing Alice we're willing to negotiate. However, the increase is relatively small to signal we're still aiming for a price well below her asking price.
* **Staying Below John's Price:** It's crucial to remain below John's offer of $1,200,000. This ensures we're still pursuing a better deal with Alice. 
* **Justification and Seriousness:** The message emphasizes our budget constraints while reiterating our serious interest in the product. This helps maintain a positive tone and encourages Alice to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but your current offer is still not financially feasible for me. I'm willing to make one more significant move to close this deal. If you agree to $1,600,000, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above John's Price:** Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,200,000. 
* **Pressure Tactic:** Alice is using a common negotiation tactic by suggesting she'll ""explore other options."" This is likely a bluff to pressure us into accepting.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  We still have several rounds left, and Alice's tone suggests she's willing to negotiate further, even if she says it's her ""final offer."""

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still a big stretch for my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,350,000.  This shows my commitment to getting this deal done."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:** We're splitting the difference between her last offer ($1,600,000) and our last offer ($1,150,000). This technique can be a powerful way to move negotiations forward.
* **Below John, Above Our Target:** This offer remains below John's price while still giving us some room to negotiate above our ideal price if needed. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  We're nearing the halfway point of the rounds, so adding a phrase like ""commitment to getting this deal done"" injects a sense of urgency without being overly aggressive."
