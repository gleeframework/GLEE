Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:** $1,500,000 (You'll sell to John at this price if Bob declines).
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000 (This is the maximum he'd logically pay).
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum price and Bob's maximum. This makes the negotiation tricky.

**Strategy**

Since there's no ZOPA based on the given information, you have two main options:

1. **High Anchor and Negotiate:** Start with a price significantly higher than $1,500,000. This might seem counterintuitive, but it allows you to:
    * Gauge Bob's interest and potential to go higher than $1,200,000.
    * Slowly negotiate down, potentially settling somewhere above your reservation price.

2. **Direct Sale to John:** Knowing Bob's valuation is below your minimum, you can directly sell to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000.

**The Offer (Using Strategy 1)**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its value and market demand, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I'm open to discussing this further and exploring possibilities that work for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Anchor:** The $1,800,000 starting point sets a high expectation.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message emphasizes willingness to discuss, which is crucial in a situation where the initial offer is likely to be rejected.
* **Justification:** Mentioning ""value and market demand"" provides a reason for the high price, even if not explicitly stated.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Information:** This strategy assumes you have no additional information about Bob's financial flexibility or potential emotional attachment to the product.
* **Time Sensitivity:** If you need to sell quickly, going directly to John might be the safer choice.
