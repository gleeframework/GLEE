"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its value and market demand, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I'm open to discussing this further and exploring possibilities that work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your budget and what John is offering. This starting point suggests there's room for negotiation. 

Here's the breakdown:

* **Alice's Offer:** $1,800,000
* **Your Budget:** $1,200,000
* **John's Offer:** $1,200,000

You should definitely reject Alice's initial offer, but it's too early to go straight to John. There's potential to negotiate a price lower than $1,800,000 and potentially closer to your budget. 

**Therefore:** {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
