"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a compromise that could work for both of us.",875000.0,Alice,3,
