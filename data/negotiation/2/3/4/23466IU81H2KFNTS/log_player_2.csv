"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my ideal price point. I want to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows me to attempt a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given its value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a compromise that could work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $875,000, which is only $25,000 more than my initial counteroffer of $850,000.  This is a good deal for me, especially considering John is selling the product for $1,000,000. Accepting this offer will save me a significant amount of money."
