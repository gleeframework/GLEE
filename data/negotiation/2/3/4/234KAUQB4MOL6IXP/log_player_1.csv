Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth the price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** Bob is willing to pay $10,000, so offering $12,000 gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You're willing to accept $15,000, so this offer provides room for you to lower the price if necessary. 
* **It's not too aggressive:** Starting with a price too close to your minimum might make Bob hesitant to negotiate. 

This strategy allows you to explore potential negotiation while keeping in mind your minimum acceptable price and John's offer as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum price of $15,000, and also significantly lower than my initial offer of $12,000. It's too risky to accept his offer as it would result in a significant loss compared to selling to John.  

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round to explore a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,500 is too low for me. How about $11,500?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is within range:**  $11,500 is above Bob's offer of $10,500, but still below my initial offer of $12,000. It shows flexibility while staying within my acceptable range.
* **Message emphasizes value:**  The message highlights the product's value, justifying the counteroffer and leaving space for further negotiation.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation alive while showing I'm not willing to sell at a significant loss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about $11,000? I think that's a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is close to my initial offer of $12,000 and is significantly higher than his previous offer of $10,500.  While I'm still willing to accept John's offer for $15,000, accepting Bob's offer now will avoid further rounds of negotiation and allow me to secure a sale. I will accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $11,000."
