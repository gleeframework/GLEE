"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can see the value in this product is worth more than $9,000 to me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. Is that a price you'd be comfortable with?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This feels like a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we meet at $11,250? I think that's a fair price for this exceptional product.",11250.0,Alice,5,
