"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its unique features, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is far too high.  While the product might be worth $15,000 to her, it's only worth $8,000 to me. I should make a counteroffer significantly lower to try and negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way outside my budget. This product would be valuable to me, but I'm looking to spend closer to $9,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value and my bottom line. This product offers unique features that you won't find elsewhere. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $17,000 is still much higher than I'm willing to pay. It's clear there's some room for negotiation, so I'll continue the back-and-forth to try and reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand this product has great features, but $17,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  To be honest, $10,000 is the absolute highest I could go. If that's not workable, I might have to explore other options."",
