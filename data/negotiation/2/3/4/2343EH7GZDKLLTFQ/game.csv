"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its unique features, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000.  What are your thoughts?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way outside my budget. This product would be valuable to me, but I'm looking to spend closer to $9,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value and my bottom line. This product offers unique features that you won't find elsewhere. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand this product has great features, but $17,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  To be honest, $10,000 is the absolute highest I could go. If that's not workable, I might have to explore other options.",10000.0,Bob,4,
