Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm going to start by offering the product to Bob for $90. This gives me a good profit margin, and I believe it's still a fair price for Bob, considering he values the product at $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I believe I can still get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with $85. This is still a good price for both of us - it's a compromise between my initial offer and his counteroffer."
