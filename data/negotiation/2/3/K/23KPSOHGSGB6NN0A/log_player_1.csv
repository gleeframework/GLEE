"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to be flexible on price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product and appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $12,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a decent offer, I'm aiming for a higher price. It's still early in the negotiation, and there's a chance to secure a better deal with Bob or sell to John if things don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm still aiming for a bit higher than that.  How about $12,500?  Let's meet in the middle.  "", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've given this some thought, Alice. I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my previous proposal. My counteroffer is now $12,200 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now only $300 away from my last counteroffer. It's getting closer to my desired price, and with more rounds to go, it's risky to hold out for more. Accepting this offer is a good compromise and avoids the potential of getting stuck with a lower price if I reject and Bob backs down further."
