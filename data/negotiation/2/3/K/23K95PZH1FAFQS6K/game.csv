"Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $80.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is too low for me. This product is high-quality and worth a lot more. How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your product is high quality, but $140 is still a bit out of my price range.  Let's try $100 - that's a significant compromise from my initial offer and hopefully fair for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  How about this: I'll come down to $125, and that's my final offer. It's a great deal for this product.",125.0,Alice,5,
