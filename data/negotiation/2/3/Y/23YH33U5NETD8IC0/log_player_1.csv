Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and holds significant value for someone like you.  While my minimum acceptable price is confidential, I'm offering you the first chance to acquire it. Are you interested in discussing a price around $900,000?"", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible since we know John will buy it at that price.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting at $900,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Value Emphasis:** The message emphasizes the ""unique opportunity"" and ""significant value"" to entice Bob while subtly implying it's worth more than his perceived $800,000 value.
* **Confidentiality:**  Not disclosing the minimum price ($1,000,000) strengthens our negotiating position."
