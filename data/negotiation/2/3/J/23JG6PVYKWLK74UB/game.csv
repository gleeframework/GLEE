"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it for less than what it's worth to you, and I'll still get a good price. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12500. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12500 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13250? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.  What do you say?",13250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $13250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13000. Can we meet at this price?",13000.0,Bob,4,
