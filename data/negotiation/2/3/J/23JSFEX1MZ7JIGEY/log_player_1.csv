Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a high point, leaving room for potential compromise. It also significantly exceeds my minimum acceptable price, giving me a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than the value I know the product holds for him. I believe I can push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
``` 

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation.  I believe this price is fair, as it's closer to the middle ground between our initial offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now closer to my minimum acceptable price, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether. It's better to accept his offer and secure the sale."
