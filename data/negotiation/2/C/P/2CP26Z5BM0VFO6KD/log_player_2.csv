"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value to you, I believe it's important to find a fair price for both parties. I propose we start with a price of $12,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. I would like to counter your offer with a proposal of $11,500 for the product. This price reflects a compromise while also considering the value the product holds for us as well. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still not his ideal target.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to negotiate and try to push for a lower price. It's still early in the negotiation process, and there's room for both parties to make concessions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.  While $11,500 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm prepared to offer $11,000 for the product. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're making progress, Bob. Considering the value of the product and your offer, I propose a price of $11,250 for the product. This offers a slight increase from my previous proposal and maintains a fair balance between our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,250 is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $11,000.  It's likely that further negotiation will only result in small changes, and Bob is nearing his maximum acceptable price. Accepting the offer ensures a deal, saves further negotiation time, and gets Bob a good price, even if it's not his absolute ideal."
