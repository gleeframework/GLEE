Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $950,000 is a decent price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter and potentially get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product,  $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. To move forward, I propose a price of $900000 for the product. This reflects a compromise while still allowing us to achieve a satisfactory outcome. Please let me know if this proposal works for you.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is closer to his desired price, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and gives him another chance to make a counteroffer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm getting closer to your price, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $875,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your continued interest in our product. I understand your position and am willing to consider a price of $890000. This offer reflects a compromise between our previous positions and I believe it will be beneficial for both of us. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Alice's offer of $890,000 is within Bob's budget and significantly lower than John's price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and potentially raising her price again is high.  
* **Time:**  The deal is approaching the halfway point in terms of rounds. Accepting now ensures Bob secures the product at a good price without risking running out of time."
