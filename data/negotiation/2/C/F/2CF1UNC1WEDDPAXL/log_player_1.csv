Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for a potential profit beyond our minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is still significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), giving us negotiation room while remaining attractive compared to losing the deal.
* **""Exclusive Opportunity"" Framing:** This creates a sense of urgency and potential loss for Bob if he declines. 

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might counter-offer, or we might need to go to John. However, this strategy provides a strong starting point to maximize our potential gain."
