,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice. $10,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can make this work.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $10,500 for the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $9,500 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll give you a slightly better offer. My counteroffer is $10,750 for the product.",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to stay within my budget.  $10,750 is still a bit high. I'm willing to go up to $10,000 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go down to $10,000. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to make one more concession. My final counteroffer is $11,000 for the product. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",11000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is my final offer.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to budge any further, Bob. I've already made concessions, and I believe my product is worth more than what you're offering. However, I'm willing to make one last attempt to reach a deal. My final counteroffer is $11,250 for the product. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",11250.0,Alice,9,
