Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is significantly higher than your minimum value but also leaves room for negotiation.  This allows for potential to get closer to Bob's perceived value while still getting a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $100 is a good price, it is still far from the value Bob places on the product. It's worth trying to get closer to his perceived value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and $100 is tempting. However, I'm willing to come down to $110. This is still a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's meet in the middle, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $110, but I'm still a bit short. Can you meet me at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $105 is now very close to my desired price. There's not much room for further negotiation, and it's a good price considering the value Bob places on the product. Accepting this offer would be the best choice."
