"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $750,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value you'll gain.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I still believe we can find a middle ground. I would like to propose a price of $850,000 for the product.
