"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than Alice's asking price, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his maximum of $8,000. Bob is still in a position to negotiate, and rejecting the offer allows him to make a counter-offer closer to his target price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,500 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering the value I'm receiving. I hope we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  At this point, further negotiation may not be fruitful, as Alice has already shown a reluctance to go lower.  Since John is offering the product for Bob's maximum budget, it's the most financially sensible option for Bob to purchase the product from John."
