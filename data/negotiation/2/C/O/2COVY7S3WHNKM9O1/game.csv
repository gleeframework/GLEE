"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,500 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering the value I'm receiving. I hope we can come to an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",10000.0,Alice,5,
