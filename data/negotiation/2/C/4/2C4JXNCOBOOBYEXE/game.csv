"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable. I believe this price is fair, considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $820,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",820000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer of $950,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  This would give us both a fair deal, and I'm confident you'll find the product's value is well worth it at this price. ",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $820,000. How about we meet in the middle from my previous offer, at $810,000? I think that's a fair price for the product's value to me.",810000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $810,000 is still a bit too low for me.  To show my willingness to meet you halfway, I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value.  What do you say?",875000.0,Alice,5,
