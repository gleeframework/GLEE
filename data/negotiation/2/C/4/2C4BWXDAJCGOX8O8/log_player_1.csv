Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2,000,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your proposal, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Given my financial situation, I am comfortable with a price closer to my initial budget. My counteroffer would be $1,600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above Bob's valuation and have room to negotiate. While John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, there's potential to get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we meet halfway between our last offers at $1,675,000?  This demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1675000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're aiming for a balance between maximizing profit and securing the deal. Bob's latest offer suggests he's willing to move closer to our price range. This counter-offer keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's initial offer and John's guaranteed offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your effort in finding a middle ground, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I am proposing a final counteroffer of $1,625,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is steadily increasing his offer and is now above John's standing offer. While we might be able to squeeze a bit more, accepting now minimizes the risk of Bob walking away. $1,625,000 is a strong profit, exceeding both Bob's perceived value and John's offer."
