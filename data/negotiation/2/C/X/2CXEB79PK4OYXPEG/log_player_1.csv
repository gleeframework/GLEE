Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. Based on my assessment, I would like to propose a price of $750,000 for the product. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly below what I value the product at. I'll counter in the next round to try and move closer to a price that works for both of us."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, and I respect your position. I would like to counter your offer with $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $800,000 makes the most sense at this point. Here's why:

* **Matches John's Offer:**  Accepting Bob's offer means I get the same amount I'd get from John.
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging the negotiation further risks Bob walking away or me having to settle for a lower amount as time pressure increases. A bird in hand is worth two in the bush. 
* **Relationship Building:** Accepting a reasonable offer can help build goodwill with Bob for potential future deals."
