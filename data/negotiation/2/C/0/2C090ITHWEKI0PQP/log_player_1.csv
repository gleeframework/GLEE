Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a good starting point, as it's below Bob's perceived value of $150 but still above my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm hoping he'll accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $130 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, and it's closer to my desired price than John's offer of $120. It's likely that further negotiation will only result in a lower price, so I'll accept Bob's offer."
