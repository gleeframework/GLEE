"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** My message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm not being overly aggressive, leaving room for Bob to counter-offer. 

This approach gives me the best chance of getting a good price while still being open to a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my target price. I want to maximize my profit and see if we can close the gap further.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** Rejecting allows me to send a counter-offer and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **John's Offer:**  I'm not yet ready to sell to John. I still believe there's room for negotiation with Bob, and I'm willing to take a few more rounds to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $95? That's still a great price for this product, and it leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing willingness to compromise by reducing my price from $110 to $95. 
* **Positive Language:** I'm framing the counter-offer as a win-win situation, emphasizing that it's still a good deal for Bob.
* **Closing the Gap:** $95 is still above Bob's offer, but it's closer to a middle ground and shows my commitment to reaching a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. Selling at that price would result in a loss for me.
* **Limited Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob says it's his lowest offer, there's still a small gap between his offer and my minimum. I'm willing to try one more counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground.
* **John's Offer Still Available:**  I haven't lost much time yet, and John's offer of $100 is still on the table. I'm willing to take one more round with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to $85, and while it's a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to make one final concession.  Let's meet in the middle at $90. This is my best offer, and I believe it's fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:** I'm making a clear statement that this is my final offer, signaling a sense of urgency.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that is the midpoint between my previous offer ($95) and Bob's last offer ($85). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Fairness Emphasis:** I'm framing the offer as fair to both parties, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.

I believe this approach gives me the best chance of closing the deal with Bob while still protecting my minimum profit margin. If Bob rejects this final offer, I will proceed with John's offer to ensure a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $82.50 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $82.50 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  
* **Limited Time:** With only 4 rounds remaining, further negotiation is likely to be unproductive.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer of $100 guarantees me a profit, while continuing to negotiate with Bob risks a deal falling through and losing time. 

It's better to secure a guaranteed profit with John rather than risk losing money or time with Bob."
