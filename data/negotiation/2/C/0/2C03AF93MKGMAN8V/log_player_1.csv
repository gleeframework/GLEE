Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you value highly. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This represents a significant saving compared to your own valuation while still securing a fair return for me.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a strong offer of $925,000. This is closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) than my minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While my initial price is high, it leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  The message highlights the value proposition for Bob (""you value highly"", ""significant saving""). This aims to make the price more palatable.
* **Alternative Buyer (John) as Leverage:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale with John at $800,000 provides a safety net. It allows me to be more assertive in my offer to Bob.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob. If he rejects the offer, I can always rely on John to meet my minimum acceptable price."
