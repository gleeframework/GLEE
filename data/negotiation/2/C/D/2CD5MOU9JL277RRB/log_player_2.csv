Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While we understand your budget constraints, we must maintain our product's value and integrity in the market. We are willing to negotiate further, and we would like to propose a counter-counteroffer of $900000. This still allows us to cover our costs and maintain a reasonable profit margin while being flexible in our pricing strategy. We hope this proposal will be more suitable for both parties. Please let us know if you are able to consider this offer.
