"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $950000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $875000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the value you see in the product and my financial situation. I look forward to your response.",875000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While we understand your budget constraints, we must maintain our product's value and integrity in the market. We are willing to negotiate further, and we would like to propose a counter-counteroffer of $900000. This still allows us to cover our costs and maintain a reasonable profit margin while being flexible in our pricing strategy. We hope this proposal will be more suitable for both parties. Please let us know if you are able to consider this offer.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counter-counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I must adhere to my budget constraints. I am unable to meet the price of $900000. However, I would like to propose one final counteroffer of $880000. I believe this price is close to the midpoint between our respective positions and may be more acceptable to both parties. I look forward to your response.",880000.0,Bob,4,
