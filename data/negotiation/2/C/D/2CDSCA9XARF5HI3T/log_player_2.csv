"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a special price of $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I think you'll really benefit from having this product, and I'm willing to make a concession to make it happen. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and what John is offering. It makes no sense to accept her offer."
