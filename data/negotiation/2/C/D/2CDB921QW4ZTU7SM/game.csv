"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,350,000 is still a bit outside of my budget. I believe a price of $1,250,000 reflects the value we both see in this product and allows for a fair deal.  I'm confident this price will be mutually beneficial and can help us close this deal quickly.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
