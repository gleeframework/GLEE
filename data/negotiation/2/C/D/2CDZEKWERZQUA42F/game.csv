"Bob, I appreciate you countering and engaging in this discussion. While your valuation is understandable, the product's intrinsic value and potential warrant a higher price point.  I could consider coming down to $1,700,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's true worth.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer and making a counteroffer, Alice. I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the value I can bring to the product.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
