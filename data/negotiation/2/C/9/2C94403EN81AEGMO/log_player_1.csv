Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is still lower than what I'm aiming for. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to meet Bob halfway.  This offer is a compromise,  showing I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I can still try to push for a slightly higher price. If Bob rejects my next offer, I'll be willing to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

This is my final offer. It's a small increase from Bob's last offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. If Bob rejects this, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but since I'm confident John is willing to buy at that price, I'll take the sure thing and sell to John.  There's no guarantee Bob will agree to a higher price in further negotiation."
