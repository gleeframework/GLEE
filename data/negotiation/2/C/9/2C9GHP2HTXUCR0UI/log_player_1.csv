{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer allows for a good profit margin for me while also being attractive enough to Bob, considering his perceived value of the product. It leaves room for negotiation, but also ensures I don't lose out on too much profit if Bob rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming down from your initial price. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

While Bob's offer is better than what John is offering, it's still below my desired profit margin. I believe I can get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still a little below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This price still provides a good value for you, given the product's worth to you, and it's a fair compromise. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
