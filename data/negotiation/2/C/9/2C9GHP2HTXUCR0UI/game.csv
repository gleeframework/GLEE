"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still a little below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This price still provides a good value for you, given the product's worth to you, and it's a fair compromise. Let's finalize this deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,
