"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming down from your initial price. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a good middle ground between Alice's initial offer and Bob's ideal price.  It shows Bob is serious about buying but also willing to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still a little below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This price still provides a good value for you, given the product's worth to you, and it's a fair compromise. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,500, which is a better deal than John's $12,000.  This is a good compromise for Bob, allowing him to save $2,500 compared to John's offer.  There is little benefit in continuing to negotiate with Alice at this point, as it's unlikely she will go lower."
