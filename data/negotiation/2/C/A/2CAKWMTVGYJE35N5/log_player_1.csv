Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with my target price of $1,000,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, given that I have a guaranteed sale to John for this amount. It's unlikely Bob will accept this immediately, but it sets a strong starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not going to sell for that low. I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm dropping my price to $900,000, which is still higher than what Bob offered but shows a willingness to compromise. This could potentially incentivize Bob to come up with a more reasonable counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'm comfortable accepting.  I'll continue negotiating with him, hoping to reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $850,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise further. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to increase his offer, potentially bringing us closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, Bob's offers are still too low. He's not showing a strong willingness to increase his offer.  I've already lowered my price significantly, and it's unlikely he'll go any higher. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for the guaranteed price of $1,000,000."
