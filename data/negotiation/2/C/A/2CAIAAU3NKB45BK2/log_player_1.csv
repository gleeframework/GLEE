"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Starting significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) and your minimum ($1,500,000) leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** Framing the price around ""exceptional value"" and ""significant benefits"" aims to steer Bob's focus towards the product's worth rather than just the number.
* **Open-ended question:**  Inviting Bob's thoughts encourages him to engage in the negotiation rather than just giving a flat rejection.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's negotiation style:**  Is he aggressive or more passive?
2. **Establish a high anchor:**  Even if Bob counters much lower, the initial high price might influence his perception of a ""fair"" deal. 
3. **Signal confidence:**  A strong opening offer shows you believe in the product's value. 

We have John as a safety net ($1,500,000 guaranteed), so we can afford to be bold in these early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the price. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is significantly below our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While he attempted to anchor the negotiation by mentioning our minimum, accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss. 

We still have ample room for negotiation and a guaranteed offer from John. Rejecting this low offer demonstrates our firm stance on the product's value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. This product offers unique advantages, and I'm confident it can exceed your initial expectations in terms of returns. To move this forward, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This price reflects a more accurate valuation while still offering you a significant opportunity."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge but stand firm:** We acknowledge Bob's counteroffer but clearly state it's unacceptable. 
* **Reiterate value:** We continue emphasizing the product's benefits, subtly challenging his perceived value of $1,000,000.
* **Strategic reduction:** We lower our price by $300,000, showing a willingness to negotiate but not to be lowballed.
* **Justification:** Framing the new price as a ""more accurate valuation"" avoids appearing arbitrary and keeps the focus on the product's worth.

By staying above $1,500,000 (John's offer) and using value-based language, we maintain a strong negotiating position while encouraging Bob to engage more realistically."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,550,000. This is a compromise between our initial positions, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is now above our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 (John's offer).  While we could potentially push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk Bob might:

* **Become frustrated:**  Repeated rejections could make him walk away.
* **Lower his offer:**  He might perceive our reluctance as a sign to lowball further.

Accepting this offer secures a profit above our minimum and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
