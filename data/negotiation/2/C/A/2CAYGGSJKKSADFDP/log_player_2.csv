"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to start the negotiations at $2,300,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's opening offer is far beyond your budget. It's best to reject the offer and start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $2,300,000 is closer to the product's true value. To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still too high, and she's declared it her final offer.  While you could continue to negotiate, the risk of not reaching an agreement within the 10 rounds is too high. Buying from John ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids any further negotiation."
