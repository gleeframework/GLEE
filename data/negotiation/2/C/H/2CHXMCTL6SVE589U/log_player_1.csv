Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $800,000 is significantly less than what the product is worth to me, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 
 
I'm going to counter with $1,200,000. This is still a good deal for Bob, as it's a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $720,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I want to close the deal, $720,000 is still too low for me. I think I can still get a better price from Bob, and I'm willing to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,000,000. This is my floor price. I'm willing to sell to Bob at this price, but if he rejects it, I'll sell to John instead."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is clearly not willing to meet my minimum price. With only 4 rounds left, I'm going to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,000,000. It's not ideal, but it's better than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with a much lower price."
