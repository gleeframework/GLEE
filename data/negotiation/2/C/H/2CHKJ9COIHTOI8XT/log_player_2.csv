"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is better than $1,000,000, it's still above Bob's desired price of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $850,000, which is still a significant saving compared to Alice's initial offer of $900,000. It also leaves some room for negotiation and potential compromise. This counteroffer is a strong starting point for Bob to try and secure a deal closer to his desired price of $800,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $875,000 is still above Bob's desired price of $800,000. However, it's significantly closer to his target, and further negotiation might not yield a better price. 

* **Buying from John:** John's offer is the best price, but it's risky to assume further negotiation with Alice will result in a lower price. 
* **Rejecting and counteroffering again:** There's no guarantee Alice will budge further, and this could prolong the negotiation, potentially leading to Alice changing her mind and not selling at all. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer at $875,000 represents a good balance between getting a decent price and minimizing risk."
