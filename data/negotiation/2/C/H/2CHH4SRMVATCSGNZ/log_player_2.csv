"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $90 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. You should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested, but $90 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $65?"",

``` 

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it leaves room for further negotiation while staying well below your $80 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $65 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $75. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75

Alice is getting closer to your budget, but there's still room to negotiate. You should counteroffer with a price closer to $70."
