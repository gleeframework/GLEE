Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $10,000 is more than your minimum of $8,000, ensuring you profit.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  $10,000 is below Bob's perceived value of $12,000, giving him room to negotiate if he wants to. 

This strategy balances your desire to maximize profit with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a bit of a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $9,000 is still above your minimum of $8,000.  While you could try to push for a higher price, accepting his offer guarantees a sale at a good profit margin.  There's always a chance Bob might reject a further counteroffer or the negotiation might drag on, potentially leading to you selling to John for less.  It's better to lock in the $9,000 profit."
