Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is within my budget and a good price considering John is selling for $12,000. It's a good deal for me, so I'll accept."
