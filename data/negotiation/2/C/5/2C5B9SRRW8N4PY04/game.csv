"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's below my minimum asking price, but still above your estimated value. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm very interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $10,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price to make this worthwhile. How about $12,000? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,3,
