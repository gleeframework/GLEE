Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $10,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price to make this worthwhile. How about $12,000? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let me know what you think.
