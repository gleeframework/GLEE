You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little from my initial offer. How about $9,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is getting closer to the price John is offering, but there's still room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can push a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9,250? It's a fair price for both of us and I'm confident we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to my target price, but $9,250 is still more than I'm willing to pay.  I've already gone through 4 rounds of negotiation, and it's time to secure a deal.  I'll go with John's offer of $8,000.  It's a guaranteed price, and it's the best deal I can find right now."
