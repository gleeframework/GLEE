"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little from my initial offer. How about $9,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both agree on.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9,250? It's a fair price for both of us and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",9250.0,Alice,5,
