{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $125. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above my minimum price of $100, but still lower than what Bob values the product at. This allows for room for negotiation and potentially reaching a deal that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum price of $100.  While I want to make a deal, I can't accept such a low price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? That's still a good deal for you, considering you value it at $150, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you need to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you at $95, which is closer to my target price. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm willing to negotiate, Bob's offer of $95 is still below my minimum price of $100.  I'd rather sell to John and guarantee a profit than risk further negotiations with Bob that might result in an even lower price."
