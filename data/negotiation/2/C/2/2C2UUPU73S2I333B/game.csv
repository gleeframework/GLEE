,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? That's still a good deal for you, considering you value it at $150, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you at $95, which is closer to my target price. Would you be willing to consider that?",95.0,Bob,4,
