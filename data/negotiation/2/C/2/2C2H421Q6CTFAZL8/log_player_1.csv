"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product that I know will be a valuable asset to your business.  I'm confident it's worth at least $1 million to you, and I'm starting with a price of $950,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I agree this product would be useful, but $950,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $700,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round. While $700,000 is better than my minimum, it's still significantly less than what I believe the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $700,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $850,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's try $875,000.  This is a fair compromise, considering the value you'll gain from this product."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $875,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?  That's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob's offer is exactly what John is willing to pay, so it makes sense to sell to John. There is no point in continuing negotiations with Bob as he seems unwilling to go higher."
