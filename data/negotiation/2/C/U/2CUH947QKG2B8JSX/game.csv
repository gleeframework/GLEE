"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This would still give you a substantial profit while ensuring a significant savings for me. Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, and I'm proposing $900,000 for the product. This still leaves you with a significant savings compared to its true value, and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
