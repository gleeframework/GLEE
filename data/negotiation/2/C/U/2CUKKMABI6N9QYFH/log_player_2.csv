Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $600,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $900,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $750,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.

It's time to switch tactics.  Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $750,000. You can get the product for $800,000 from John, which is only slightly more than continuing a potentially lengthy negotiation with Alice."
