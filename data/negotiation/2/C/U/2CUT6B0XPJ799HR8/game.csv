"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but was hoping to spend closer to $60. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is simply not feasible for me. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but let's meet in the middle. How about $90? That gives us both a good deal. Let me know your thoughts.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're making a compromise, and I appreciate that.  How about we settle at $75? That's a fair offer that brings us closer to a deal.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $75 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more. Would you consider $85? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say?",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $80? That seems like a fair compromise to me.",80.0,Bob,6,
