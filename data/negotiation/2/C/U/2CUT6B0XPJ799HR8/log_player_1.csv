"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but was hoping to spend closer to $60. Would you be willing to come down on the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $60 is far too low for me. I'll see if I can get a better counteroffer from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is simply not feasible for me. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but let's meet in the middle. How about $90? That gives us both a good deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're making a compromise, and I appreciate that.  How about we settle at $75? That's a fair offer that brings us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $75 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $75 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more. Would you consider $85? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $80? That seems like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my minimum of $120, $80 is a decent compromise and allows me to close the deal without risking selling to John for less."
