"Round 1

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but was hoping to spend closer to $60. Would you be willing to come down on the price?"",

``` 
```tool_code
print(""Reason:I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to understand Alice's flexibility. This price is within my budget and provides a good starting point for negotiation."")
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is simply not feasible for me. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but let's meet in the middle. How about $90? That gives us both a good deal. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

print(""Reason:While closer to my budget, $90 is still more than I want to spend, especially when I have the option to buy from John for $80. There's room for further negotiation."")
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand that you're making a compromise, and I appreciate that.  How about we settle at $75? That's a fair offer that brings us closer to a deal."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 
```tool_code
print(""Reason: I'm inching closer to my maximum budget while still aiming for a price lower than Alice's offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not be pushed to my limit."")
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $75 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more. Would you consider $85? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
```tool_code
print(""Reason: Alice is getting closer to a price I'm willing to accept, but it's still more expensive than John's offer. I'll use my remaining rounds to see if I can get her closer to $80."")

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. How about $80? That seems like a fair compromise to me."",

}
``` 
```tool_code
print(""Reason: I'm now offering Alice my maximum budget, which matches what John is offering. This is a firm but fair offer, and it's unlikely Alice will go much lower."")
