Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

I'm starting with my minimum price, knowing that I can always go lower. If Bob rejects, I'll have to decide whether to lower the price or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, and I'm not sure if we'll reach a price that I'm comfortable with.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John, I'm going to take the safe option and sell to him for $10,000."
