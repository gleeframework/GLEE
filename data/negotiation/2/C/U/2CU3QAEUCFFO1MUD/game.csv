"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8000 on this product. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I have to consider my own needs, and I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $9250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $8750. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product and allows for both of us to walk away happy.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still looking to save a bit, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'll counteroffer at $9000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a great compromise that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,5,
