"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll love. It's a unique opportunity to get a high-quality item at a competitive price. Would you like to make an offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. The product is worth no more than $8,000 to him, and Alice's initial offer is too high.  He can counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000 on this product. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8,500?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I have to consider my own needs, and I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $9250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price.  He's only had three rounds and still has seven more to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product and allows for both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still looking to save a bit, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'll counteroffer at $9000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a great compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has reached the 5th round, and while Alice's counteroffer is closer to his ideal price, it's still higher than his maximum budget of $8,000.  It's likely that further negotiations will only result in a small decrease in the price.  It's wiser for Bob to cut his losses and buy the product from John for his maximum budget price."
