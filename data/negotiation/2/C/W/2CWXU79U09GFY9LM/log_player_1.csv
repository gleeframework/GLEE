"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it holds significant value for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price to maximize my potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my minimum value, allowing for room to negotiate and hopefully reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the unique opportunity and potential value to Bob, hoping to pique his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum value:** Bob's offer of $800,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Limited Time and Risk:**  I'm on round 2, and there's a risk of further negotiation reducing my profits. 
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  Even if I reject Bob's offer, I have John's offer as a guaranteed safety net.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a profitable sale quickly and minimize potential negotiation risks."
