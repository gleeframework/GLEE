"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to make an offer of $8,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. I'd love to hear if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to make a deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $10,500.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to accept $9,500. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to stay above my minimum. My counteroffer is $10,000, and I'm willing to meet you at this price. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $10,000, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, and that's my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'd be happy to make a deal.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised you're willing to go as low as $9,000, Bob. I think I can meet you at a price that's a bit higher than that, but not much. My counteroffer is $9,800, and I'm willing to consider it a final offer from me. If not, I'll have to move on.",9800.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $9,500, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",9500.0,Alice,9,
