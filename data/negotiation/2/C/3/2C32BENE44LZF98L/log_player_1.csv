Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is a starting point.  Here's why I chose this offer:

* **Above your minimum:** $10,000 is above your minimum of $8,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Not too high:** It's not an unreasonable starting point, allowing for a potential compromise.
* **Friendly tone:** The message is positive and open to discussion, encouraging Bob to engage. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Your knowledge of Bob:** Do you have any information about his budget or interest in the product? This could influence your starting price.
* **Market research:** Have you researched the market value of similar products? This can help you set a reasonable price.
* **Negotiation strategy:** Are you willing to be flexible and make concessions? Or are you more assertive in your pricing? 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit while keeping Bob interested in the deal. Good luck!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is exactly your minimum acceptable price. While you could try to counteroffer and potentially get a slightly higher price, the risk is that Bob will walk away.  Selling to John guarantees you your minimum, and there's no further risk of losing the deal."
