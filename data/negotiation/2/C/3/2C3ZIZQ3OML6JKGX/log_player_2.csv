"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $11,500 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than Alice's initial value of $12,000, Bob can potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and a possible lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,000?  This would give us both a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a better deal than Alice's initial offer, Bob can likely still get a lower price.  Since he's already made a counter-offer, there's room for further negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue trying to secure a price closer to his target of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  This would be a good compromise and allow us to both close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  While $10,750 is closer, I'm still hoping we can find a price that's mutually beneficial.  I'm willing to come down to $11,250.  This would be a good compromise and a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price of $10,000. While Alice has moved closer to Bob's price, it's still above his comfort zone. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal.  He's also got the option to buy from John for $10,000 if the negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to go up to $10,900, but that's my final offer.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 10900}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're firm on your price, but $10,900 is still a little lower than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle once more. How about $11,050? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to come away satisfied. Let's see if we can finally close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,050 is still above Bob's target price of $10,000.  While there's a chance Bob might be able to negotiate down further,  it's getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds and the risk of not getting a deal at all is increasing.  Since Bob can secure the product for $10,000 from John, it's the most sensible choice to buy from John and avoid any further negotiation risk."
