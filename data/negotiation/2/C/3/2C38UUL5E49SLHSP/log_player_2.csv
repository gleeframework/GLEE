Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go as low as $75, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $75. How about we try $82.50?

Alice is unlikely to go below $80, and you have a guaranteed option with John at that price. There's no point in risking further negotiation."
