"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me.  I'd be happy to let it go for $95.  Let me know what you think!",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $95 is a bit high for me.  How about $85?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $85 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90?  That's still a good deal for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to make a profit, but $90 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $87.50, let's meet in the middle.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $87.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and go with $88.50. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",88.5,Alice,5,
