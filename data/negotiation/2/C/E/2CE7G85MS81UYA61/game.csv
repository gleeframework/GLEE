"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something that I'm personally very attached to, but I'm willing to part with it for the right price. I'm offering it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to me and its potential value to you.  Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,1,
