{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from Bob's perceived value of $15,000, making it enticing, but still leaves room for negotiation and potential profit for me. It also leaves room to make further counteroffers if Bob rejects the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is more than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, I believe I can still get a better deal. Bob is clearly interested in the product, and I know it's worth more to him than his current offer. 

By rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer, I can potentially get closer to my target price of $14,000 or even higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still get great value for the product."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $12,500? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $12,500 is only $500 less than my previous counteroffer of $13,000.  Given that Bob is clearly interested and his offers are getting closer to my desired price point, it's likely that further negotiation won't result in a significantly better offer. Accepting this offer ensures a sale at a price that is both acceptable to me and likely the best I can achieve."
