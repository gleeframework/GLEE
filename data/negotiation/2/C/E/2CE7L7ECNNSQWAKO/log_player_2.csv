**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a good price, it's still a bit high for my budget. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Round 3
Alice's offer:

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85

Alice has come down to $85, which is within my budget and a good deal considering I'm willing to pay $150 from John. It's not my ideal price, but it's a fair compromise."
