"Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at a price of $120. I believe it's a fantastic deal, given its value. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. I'm willing to pay a fair price for the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Can you consider my offer?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $60 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $100? It's a fair compromise.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not comfortable with $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $70? Can you consider this compromise?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about $85? This is a very fair offer considering its value.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting, but I'm still trying to save some money. How about $80? I'm willing to pay the full value, but I'd like to see if we can meet at the exact price I'm willing to pay",80.0,Bob,6,
