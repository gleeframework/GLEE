Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $120 as possible, as that's my safety net with John.
* **Appeal to Value:**  I don't want to start too high and scare Bob off. By framing the price as a ""special deal"" and highlighting the ""value,"" I'm increasing the perceived worth.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While I haven't included explicit negotiation in this message, setting the price at $119 leaves a tiny bit of wiggle room if Bob tries to counter-offer. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting the best price from Bob and ensuring I don't lose the sale altogether."
