{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $1,500,000, but it's still a good profit for me. It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob decides to counteroffer.  I'm confident that I can get a price closer to my goal through further negotiation, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob rejects my offer and a mutually agreeable price cannot be reached."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, given the value I place on it, I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. However, it is closer than his initial offer, and I believe there's still potential to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This would allow both of us to make a fair profit. Let's try to make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. While I respect your valuation, I would like to propose a price of $950,000. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'm tempted to continue negotiating with Bob, his latest offer is still too far below my desired price. I've already conceded a significant amount, and I'm concerned that further negotiation will only drag the process on without a guarantee of a satisfying outcome.  I've realized that my time is valuable, and selling to John for $1,500,000 ensures a quick and profitable deal."
