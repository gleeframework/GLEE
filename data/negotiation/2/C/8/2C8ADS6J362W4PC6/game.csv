"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this item, my budget allows me to spend up to $950,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your understanding of the product's value.  To be frank, $950,000 falls short of what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This recognizes the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand Alice, but I still believe that $950,000 was a fair price based on my budget. I am willing to increase my offer slightly to $975,000.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the product's value is firmly above $975,000.  I'm willing to consider a price of $1,025,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to find a solution that works for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground, but we need to be realistic.  The value of this product is substantial, and I'm simply not willing to go below $1,010,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of what this product brings to the table. Let me know if you're ready to make a deal.",1010000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I've considered your last offer carefully. I am willing to pay $995,000 for the product. This feels like a fair compromise given our previous discussions.",995000.0,Bob,8,
