``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. It's a good starting point,  higher than my minimum, and gives Bob some room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer more, $9,000 is a good price, and it's likely that Bob won't budge further. It's better to secure the sale than risk further negotiation and potentially end up with John's offer of $8,000."
