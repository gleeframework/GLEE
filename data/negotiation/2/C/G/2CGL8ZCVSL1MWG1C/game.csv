"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant and $1,100,000 is too far below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,325,000.  I believe this reflects a fair price that acknowledges its worth.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,325,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. While $1,200,000 is a tempting offer, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price.  Would you consider $1,275,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and deliver incredible value.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close! I'm willing to stretch my budget a little further. How about $1,225,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I'm confident in the product's value.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
