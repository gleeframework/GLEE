"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering it's worth $15,000 to you. Let's make a deal.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's fair considering your value for the product. Let's find common ground.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, but $11,500 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's close this deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While $11,000 is closer, I'm still unable to go that low. I'm willing to offer $11,250. This is a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to get a decent deal. Let's finalize this, I'm confident we can both be happy with this outcome.",11250.0,Alice,5,
