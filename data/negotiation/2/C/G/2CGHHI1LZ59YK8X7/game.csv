"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a great deal to me, and I believe it could be equally valuable to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1800000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's potential. Let me know what you think.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the opportunity to purchase the product, but $1800000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1400000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need something closer to my initial price to make this worthwhile.  How about $1600000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $1400000. How about $1500000? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
