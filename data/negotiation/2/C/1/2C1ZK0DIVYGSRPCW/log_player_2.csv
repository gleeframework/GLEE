"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price.  There's a strong chance Bob can get a better deal, especially considering John is offering the product for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This puts pressure on Alice to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is still a significant amount of money for Bob, but it's a starting point for negotiation, and it leaves room for compromise in the following rounds. The counteroffer is also close to John's price, making Bob's offer appear more reasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her original price, but $1,300,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget. Bob should continue to negotiate and see if he can get Alice to lower the price further.  He can still get a better deal with John, so there is no immediate pressure to accept Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly, but still keeping it well below Alice's offer.  This shows that Bob is willing to negotiate, but is also serious about getting the best price.  It's a compromise that could potentially lead to a deal in the next few rounds.  Bob is also mindful of John's offer, keeping his counteroffer significantly lower than that."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should try to get Alice to lower the price further before accepting, as he's still within his budget and can always go with John's offer if negotiations break down.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can potentially secure a better price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1225000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again increasing his counteroffer, this time by a smaller amount. This shows he's willing to meet Alice halfway, but is still pushing for a lower price.  He is also trying to ensure that Alice will be able to accept the offer, considering she's already lowered her offer twice. This amount is also still lower than John's offer, so there is still no immediate pressure to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has raised her offer again, indicating that she might not be willing to come down further.  It's clear that Bob is unlikely to get a deal for less than $1,250,000 from Alice. Considering only 3 rounds remain, it's not worth risking the deal completely.  Bob should accept John's offer, which is within his budget and will allow him to secure the product without further negotiation."
