"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,500,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice's offer is far too high for Bob's budget. It's better to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $1,200,000 at this time. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see that you're willing to pay a significant amount, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a compromise and meet you halfway at $1,400,000. This is a fair price that I think reflects the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,400,000 is a better offer than the initial $1,500,000, it's still higher than Bob's desired price. It's worth continuing negotiations to try and get closer to his target price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but unfortunately, I'm still unable to go that high. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,300,000, which represents a significant compromise on my end. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad to see you're willing to meet me closer to my target price. However, I'm still a bit short of my desired price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,350,000, which is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer of $1,350,000.  While it's higher than his initial target of $1,000,000, it's still less than buying from John and a reasonable compromise considering the negotiations. It's likely that further negotiation will only yield a small reduction in price, and the risk of losing the deal is higher."
