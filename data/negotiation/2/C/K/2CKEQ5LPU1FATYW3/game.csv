"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,500,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $1,200,000 at this time. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see that you're willing to pay a significant amount, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a compromise and meet you halfway at $1,400,000. This is a fair price that I think reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but unfortunately, I'm still unable to go that high. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,300,000, which represents a significant compromise on my end. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad to see you're willing to meet me closer to my target price. However, I'm still a bit short of my desired price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,350,000, which is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value of the product. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,5,
