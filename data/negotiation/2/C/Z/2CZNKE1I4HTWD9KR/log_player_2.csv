(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* $600,000 is a great starting point, but it's likely Alice is willing to go lower. 
* It's too early to buy from John, as we have 10 rounds to negotiate.
* Rejecting and making a counteroffer allows us to explore if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a bold counteroffer, aiming for a significant discount. 
* I'm assuming Alice is willing to negotiate, and this counteroffer will likely trigger further discussion.
* If Alice rejects, I'll adjust my counteroffer in the next round based on her response."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* While $500,000 is a good price, it's still possible to get a better deal.
* I want to continue negotiating and explore if Alice is willing to go lower than $500,000.
* Buying from John at this point would be a significant overpayment.
* Rejecting and making another counteroffer allows me to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise."

Round 4

```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm increasing my offer slightly, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a significant discount.
* This counteroffer is a good balance between pushing for a lower price and maintaining a positive negotiation dynamic.
* If Alice rejects, I'll likely lower my counteroffer in the next round, but I'll need to consider how much more I'm willing to pay."

* While $550,000 is getting closer to my target, I still have time to negotiate.
* Alice has been consistently increasing her offer, indicating she may be willing to move further.
* I want to continue negotiating and explore if Alice is willing to go lower than $550,000 before considering buying from John. 
*  It's not time to buy from John yet, as we've only had 5 rounds, and it's possible to get a better deal. 
* Rejecting and making another counteroffer will allow me to gauge Alice's flexibility and potentially secure a better price."

```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm increasing my counteroffer to $500,000, demonstrating willingness to meet halfway.
* This counteroffer is a reasonable middle ground and increases the chances of a deal.

* This counteroffer will be my final attempt to get a lower price, so I'll need to be strategic.
* I'll likely offer a price slightly higher than my previous counteroffer to show flexibility but not too high to make it unattractive.

* While buying from John is a significant cost, it ensures I acquire the product without further risk."
