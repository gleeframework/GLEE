Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $150. I believe it holds significant value and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the price, even if it's a bit vague, can make it seem more reasonable to the buyer.  
* **Leaving Room for John:**  While I want to maximize profit, starting too high might scare Bob off. Offering it at $150 leaves space for negotiation while keeping in mind John's standing $100 offer as a fallback."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer.  $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $90 is significantly below both your minimum ($100) and his own stated value ($100). Rejecting this offer is the best course of action. There's room to negotiate towards a price that works for both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I can't let it go for that low. How about we meet in the middle at $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This is a classic negotiation tactic. It suggests fairness and a willingness to compromise, which can be persuasive.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** $120 keeps the price well above my minimum acceptable price while still offering a significant discount from my initial offer.
* **Pressure:**  By making a counteroffer closer to his valuation than mine, I'm applying subtle pressure for Bob to concede more ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $120 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $105 is above your minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Strong Position:** While you could try to negotiate further, Bob is unlikely to go much higher since he's already offering more than his own perceived value. 
* **Time Value:**  Negotiations take time and effort. Accepting the $105 offer secures a profit and allows you to move on."
