"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a one-time offer to you directly. I'll sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message is enthusiastic, she's offering the product at her maximum price. You have nothing to lose by rejecting this offer.  You can always buy from John at the same price, so there's an opportunity to negotiate a better deal with Alice."
