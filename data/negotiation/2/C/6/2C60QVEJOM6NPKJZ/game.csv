"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $14000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to purchase it for $13000. What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $13500?  I'm confident this product will be worth it for you!",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $13500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $13250. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",13250.0,Bob,4,
