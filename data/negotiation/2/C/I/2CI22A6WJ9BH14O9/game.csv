,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $90? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 was a bit high for you, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $100? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll really enjoy the product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95, which is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal!",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. How about we meet in the middle again at $97.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll really enjoy the product.",97.5,Alice,5,
