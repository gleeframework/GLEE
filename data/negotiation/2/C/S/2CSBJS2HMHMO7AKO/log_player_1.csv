Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to make a fair offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $10,000 to me, and Bob is offering $7,500, which is significantly less. I will reject his offer and counteroffer in the next round. I believe I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand you're looking for a good deal, $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I'm still getting a fair price. How about $8,500? This would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $8,500 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to think about the value I'll get from the product. How about $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $10,000, I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further negotiations and ensure a sale."
