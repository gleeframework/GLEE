"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you a lot of value. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $18,000 for the product. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $14,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $14,000 is still significantly higher than your target price and John's offer. You have room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle. However, $14,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I could potentially go up to $10,000, but that's really pushing my budget.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $13,000 for the product. This is a good price considering the value it brings to you, and I think it's a fair deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is slowly lowering her price, but it's still too high. You're getting closer to your walk-away point, but it might be worth one more counter-offer to see if you can get closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for continuing this discussion. I'm really trying to make this work. While $13,000 is closer, it's still a bit above what I can comfortably spend.  How about we settle at $11,000? That's a significant price, and I'm ready to close the deal at that amount."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $11,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I can offer you a price of $12,500 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value it brings to you, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice. Alice is unlikely to come down to a price that's significantly better than John's offer of $8,000. You've made a good effort to negotiate, but it's best to take the guaranteed deal with John."
