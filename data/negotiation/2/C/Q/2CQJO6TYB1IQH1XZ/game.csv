"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1250000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make a bit more of a concession. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you at $1300000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
