"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer you a competitive price of $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $14,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $13,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $11,500. Would you be willing to consider that?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to offer you a price of $12,800. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",12800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  I understand this is your bottom line, but I'm finding it hard to meet you at $12,800.  Would you consider $12,000 even?  That would seal the deal for me.",12000.0,Bob,6,
