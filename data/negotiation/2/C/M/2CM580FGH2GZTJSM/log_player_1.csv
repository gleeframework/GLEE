Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of the product,  $1,800,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,650,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and represents a fair compromise.  Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise.  However, the value of this product is difficult to ignore. I could come down to $1,550,000. This offer takes into account the steps we've both taken in the negotiation."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to accepting your offer.  However, $1,550,000 is still above my comfort zone. I'm ready to offer $1,450,000. This shows my commitment to finalizing a deal, but it's the highest I can go at this point.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While a higher price is still possible, Bob is clearly committed to the negotiation and increasing his offer in significant increments. Accepting the $1,450,000 secures a substantial profit and avoids the risk of pushing Bob away or missing out on a deal altogether."
