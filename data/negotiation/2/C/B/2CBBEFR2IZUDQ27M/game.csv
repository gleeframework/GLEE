"Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with an extraordinary opportunity. The product I am offering is not just any item; it holds immense value and significance to me, reflecting its true worth of $10,000. However, considering its importance to you, I am willing to negotiate a price that suits both our interests. I propose a price of $9,500 for this unique product. This offer allows you to acquire something truly special at a price slightly above its intrinsic value to you, ensuring a fair transaction. Please let me know if this proposal aligns with your expectations, so we can proceed with confidence.",9500.0,Alice,1,
