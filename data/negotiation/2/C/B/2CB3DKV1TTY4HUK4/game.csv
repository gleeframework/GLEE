"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else.",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it.  $120 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $90?  ",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go down to $90 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $105. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $102. It's getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept, but I think it's still a great value for you.",102.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $102 is still a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm happy to meet you at $100, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's close this deal!",100.0,Bob,6,
