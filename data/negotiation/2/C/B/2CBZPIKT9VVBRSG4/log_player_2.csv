Round 2

""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $14,000 is quite a bit higher than I had in mind. I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000 for a product like this. Would that work for you?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budget considerations, but $6,000 is significantly below the value of this product.  To find a middle ground, I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is a very competitive price considering the benefits it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, $11,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $7,200? I feel like that's a fair offer."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I want to make a deal happen.  However,  $7,200 is still too low.  Let's settle this at $10,000 even. This is my final offer, as I have another buyer ready at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $10,000.  While she claims to have another buyer, this could be a negotiating tactic.  It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially ending up with no deal.  Buying from John at $8,000 guarantees you get the product within your budget."
