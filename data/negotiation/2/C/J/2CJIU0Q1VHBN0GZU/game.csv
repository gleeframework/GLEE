"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is out of my budget. I'm interested in buying your product, but I can only go up to $850000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm happy to negotiate, $850000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1000000? This is still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1000000 is still a bit too high.  I'm happy to compromise, but I'm sticking to my maximum of $900000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see we're getting closer.  $900000 is a good starting point, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's try $950000.  It's a fair compromise, and it keeps the deal profitable for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950000 is still outside my budget. I'm committed to buying your product, but I can't go higher than $925000. This offer represents a significant step towards a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal.",925000.0,Bob,6,
