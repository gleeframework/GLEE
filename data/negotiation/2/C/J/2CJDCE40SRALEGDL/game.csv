"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but the price is a little high for me right now.  Would you consider a lower price?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that the price is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $900,000 is closer, but still a bit out of my reach.  Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair value for the product.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is very close to what I can do.  Would you consider $775,000 and we have a deal?",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $775,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is the best price I can offer, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,7,
