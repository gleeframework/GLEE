"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $10,500 for this product.  Let's split the difference and call it a day?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $9,500 for the product.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting the feeling we might be stuck here.  I'm willing to go down to $10,250.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product.  I'm not willing to go any lower, so let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10250.0,Alice,5,
