"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I believe this product would be highly beneficial for you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $950,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow for a smooth transaction."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for a lower price, but the value of this product is truly significant. I could consider coming down to $1,050,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is still a better deal for Bob than buying from John for $1,200,000. While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice might reject further counteroffers, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer secures a good deal and avoids potential risks of further negotiation."
