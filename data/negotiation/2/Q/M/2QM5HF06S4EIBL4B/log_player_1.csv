"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm setting the price at $10,000.  This gives Bob room to negotiate down if he's interested, and it also establishes my starting point.  We'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I think I can still push for a bit more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping that by showing some flexibility, I can reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $9,200.  While I'd like to get even closer to my initial asking price, I'm starting to feel the pressure of time.  With only 6 rounds left, it's not worth risking that Bob will walk away and I'll be forced to sell to John for $8,000."
