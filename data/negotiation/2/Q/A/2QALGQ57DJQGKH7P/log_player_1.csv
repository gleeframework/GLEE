Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This strategy is based on the following:

* **Anchoring:** By starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000 vs. $1,200,000), we aim to set a high anchor point. This might make him perceive a lower counter-offer as more reasonable.
* **Value Highlighting:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""incredible value"" to justify the high initial price. 
* **Backup Option:** We have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 from John, ensuring we don't settle for less than our minimum.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob accepts:**  Ideal scenario, maximizing profit.
* **Bob negotiates:**  This opens the door for a back-and-forth, potentially settling somewhere between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000. 
* **Bob rejects:** We proceed to sell to John at our guaranteed price.

**Important Note:**  This is just one approach. Negotiation tactics can be complex, and the ""best"" strategy depends on many factors beyond what's provided in the prompt (e.g., Bob's personality, your risk tolerance, etc.)."
