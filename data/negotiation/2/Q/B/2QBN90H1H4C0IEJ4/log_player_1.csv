Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will pay $1,000,000, aiming for a higher price with Bob first is strategically sound. 
* **High but Negotiable:** $950,000 is significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The ""limited-time offer"" adds pressure for Bob to consider the deal seriously and potentially counter-offer quickly. 

**Why this strategy is better than simply offering it at $1,000,000 to Bob:**

* **Potential for Higher Gain:** We might secure a price closer to $950,000 from Bob, exceeding the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.
* **Negotiation Position:** Starting high gives us more room to negotiate down if Bob counters. If we started at $1,000,000, there's no room to move."
