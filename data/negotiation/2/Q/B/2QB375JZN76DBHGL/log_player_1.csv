Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering the value you place on it. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him some room to negotiate while still leaving you with a profit.
* **It's significantly lower than your minimum:** This leaves room for you to lower the price if Bob pushes back.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This helps avoid misunderstandings and keeps the negotiation focused.

Remember, you can always make a counteroffer or sell to John if Bob doesn't accept your initial offer. Good luck with the negotiation!"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1,100,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your flexibility. However, I am still working within my budget constraints. Would it be possible to consider $1,125,000 as a compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and has come closer to your desired price. Accepting his offer for $1,125,000 ensures a sale and secures a decent profit.  While you could potentially continue to negotiate, the risk of Bob walking away or you needing to sell to John for a lower price is present.  This offer provides a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a successful sale."
