Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone with your business acumen. I'm willing to make this deal happen for $950,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 to John, it's worth trying to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $950,000 is a substantial profit for me (well above my minimum), while still offering Bob a significant discount compared to the product's worth to him ($800,000). This price point makes it tempting for Bob to accept. 
* **Exclusivity:**  By framing the offer as ""exclusive"" and highlighting Bob's ""business acumen,"" I'm adding a psychological element that might make the deal more appealing."
