"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? That's a fair compromise.",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we try $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I can't go as low as $12,000.  This product is worth a lot to both of us. How about we split the difference again and settle on $12,750?",12750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product is valuable, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, but I need to be honest with you, I'm starting to consider other options if we can't meet in the middle. How about we try $12,375?",12375.0,Bob,6,
