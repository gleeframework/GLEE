Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I can't go as low as $12,000.  This product is worth a lot to both of us. How about we split the difference again and settle on $12,750?"", ""product_price"": 12750}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is valuable, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, but I need to be honest with you, I'm starting to consider other options if we can't meet in the middle. How about we try $12,375? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,375
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While I could push for a bit more, Bob is clearly signaling that this is his ceiling price.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing him as a buyer. Accepting his offer of $12,375 is a solid profit above my minimum ($10,000)."
