"Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$600,000 is a great price, but it's worth seeing if you can get it lower.  Rejecting the offer allows for potential negotiation to save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price, aiming to get a good deal. I'm hoping to encourage further negotiation and find a price that benefits both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $500,000, which is still a significant saving compared to John's price of $1,500,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might not be willing to go lower, and I could end up buying from John at a much higher price.  It's a good deal at $500,000, so accepting minimizes risk and secures a good price."
