"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. To kick things off, I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000. I believe this price reflects the true value and potential of what's on offer."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not too high):**  While we know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, starting significantly higher gives us room for negotiation and allows us to understand his willingness to pay. 
* **Justifying the Price:** By mentioning ""true value and potential,"" we aim to shift the focus from a purely numerical value to the inherent benefits of the product.
* **Leaving Room for John:** It's crucial to remember we have a guaranteed offer from John. Our goal is to maximize profit, so we don't want to get too caught up in negotiations with Bob if they aren't leading towards a significantly better deal than $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer matches John's guaranteed price. While it's tempting to accept and close the deal, we still have room to negotiate. Bob clearly sees value in the product, and we started high, so there's a chance we can secure a slightly better deal. 

We'll reject his offer now and aim for a counteroffer that's closer to our desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,350,000?  This feels like a fair deal considering the value this product brings."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** We're moving closer to Bob's offer but staying firm above our minimum acceptable price. A $150,000 reduction shows willingness to negotiate while aiming for a significant profit margin. 
* **Highlighting Value:** We're reiterating the inherent value of the product, subtly justifying the higher price point.
* **Time Consideration:**  We have seven rounds left, and while we're not in a rush, we don't want to drag out negotiations unnecessarily.  This counteroffer keeps the momentum going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,250,000? I think this is a more reasonable price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Favorable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a significant increase from his initial offer and a decent profit above John's guaranteed price. 
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating a strong desire to acquire the product. Holding out for more might make him reconsider.
* **Time Value:**  While we have rounds remaining, securing a deal now eliminates the risk of Bob walking away or the negotiation stalling.  A bird in the hand... 

This offer represents a good balance of risk and reward."
