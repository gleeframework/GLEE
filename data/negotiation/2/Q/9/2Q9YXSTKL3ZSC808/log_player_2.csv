Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a strong opening move to gauge her willingness to negotiate and establish a lower baseline."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is now at my maximum budget.  It's not ideal, but it saves me the effort of further negotiation.  Buying from John would cost the same, so there's no benefit in going that route."
