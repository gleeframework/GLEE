This is the best option for the following reasons:

* **Alice has reached her minimum:** Her message indicates she won't go lower than $1,200,000.
* **This is a good deal:**  You're getting the product for $300,000 less than John's price and $200,000 less than your initial maximum.
* **Continuing is risky:**  Pushing further could annoy Alice, or you might not have enough rounds to reach a better agreement."
