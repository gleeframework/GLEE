"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $110, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110, which is above Bob's value but below my minimum. This allows for negotiation room while still ensuring I make a profit.  I'm also trying to build a rapport with Bob by emphasizing the value of the product and offering a ""great deal""."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'm hoping for $100. This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $92. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $92 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, I'm still not comfortable selling at that price.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my goal of $120 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $92 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $96? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 96}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds and Bob is not budging much from his original offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $120. With only a few rounds left, it's not worth risking losing a guaranteed sale to John. Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $120, ensuring I achieve my minimum profit goal."
