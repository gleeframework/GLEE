Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $130. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Staying Above Value:**  While the product is only worth $100 to Bob, he might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives it as valuable or if it solves a specific need. 
* **Considering the Alternative:**  We know John will buy the product for $150, so we don't want to go below that price with Bob. 

By offering the product at $130, Alice aims to maximize her profit while still giving Bob a chance to accept a price that might be appealing compared to searching for alternatives."
