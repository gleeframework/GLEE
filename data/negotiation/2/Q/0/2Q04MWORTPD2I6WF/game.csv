"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses lower. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10000 for the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10000 just doesn't cover the cost of the product for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $10500?  That's still a great price considering the value you've placed on it.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I'm still looking for a price closer to my valuation. I would like to counter with an offer of $10200 for the product.",10200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer!  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $10200 is still a little low for me.  How about we settle on $10350?  It's a fair price for both of us.",10350.0,Alice,5,
