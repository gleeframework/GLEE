"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid I can't meet you at $9000. I can offer you a compromise at $11000. I think you'll find it's a fair price considering the product's value.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $11000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10500. Can you consider that?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $11000, but I think I can do better than that. How about we settle at $11250? It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value.",11250.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're getting closer to the price I'm willing to accept, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I can offer you a slight discount from $11250 to $11000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to meet me at $11000, I think we can finalize the deal.",11000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I can offer you a slight discount from $11000 to $10900, but that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to meet me at $10900, I think we can finalize the deal.",10900.0,Alice,9,
