"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $900,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it. I believe this price is fair, considering the product's value to me and my current financial constraints.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $850,000, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm going to offer you $825,000. This is my final offer, and it's the highest I can go at this time. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $850,000. I believe this is the best compromise we can reach, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer of $900,000.",850000.0,Alice,5,
