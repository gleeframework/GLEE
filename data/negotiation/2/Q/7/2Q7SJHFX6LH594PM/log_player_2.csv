"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $12000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice is offering it for $12,000.  There's room to negotiate and potentially get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and try to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can do $11500, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll really get a lot of value out of it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come down from $12,000 to $11,500.
* This price is still within your budget of $15,000.
* You've already made one counteroffer, and it's possible further negotiation will not be successful. 
* It's a good deal, as Alice values the product at $8,000.

Accepting this offer ensures you get the product at a decent price, and you avoid the risk of further negotiation failing and having to buy from John for a higher price."
