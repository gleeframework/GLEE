Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $19,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high initial price:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Creating a sense of scarcity:** Mentioning that you'll list the product publicly implies that Bob might miss out if he doesn't act now.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the initial price is high, the message invites Bob to share his thoughts, opening the door for potential negotiation. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:** If you know Bob to be particularly price-sensitive, you might slightly lower your initial offer. However, starting high is generally a good strategy. 
* **The nature of the product:** If the product is in high demand or unique, you can justify the higher price more easily."
