"Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $1,350,000 is a bit out of my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This price is fair considering the potential benefits for both of us. I hope you'll consider this counteroffer.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,300,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high. I'm comfortable going up to $1,275,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my part and leaves room for you to still profit.  I truly believe this is a fair price considering the potential benefits to both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
