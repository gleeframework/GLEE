**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her own value of the product, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth negotiating to potentially get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product and understand your budget constraints. After careful consideration, we are willing to adjust our offer to meet you halfway. Therefore, we propose a price of $1,300,000 for the product. We believe this price reflects the value of the product while remaining within your financial considerations. We look forward to your response and hope this offer suits your needs.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still slightly above his maximum price point. Bob can try to negotiate further, possibly by making a counteroffer closer to $1,250,000.  Since he can buy the product from John for $1,200,000, there's still room to negotiate with Alice."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,300,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit high. I'm comfortable going up to $1,275,000.

Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
