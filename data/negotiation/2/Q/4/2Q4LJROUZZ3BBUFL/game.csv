"Alice, your product is very interesting, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This price is closer to my budget, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my original price. I'm proposing $1,150,000. This is a significant discount and still allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
