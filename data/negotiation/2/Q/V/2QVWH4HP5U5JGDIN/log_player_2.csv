"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $11,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is less than Bob's maximum budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, showing his intent to negotiate aggressively.
* **Leaves room for compromise:**  $9,500 is still higher than the product's worth to Alice, allowing for potential compromises in the following rounds. 
* **Positive tone:** The message maintains a friendly and open tone, keeping the negotiation amicable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a competitive price, Bob. How about we meet halfway at $10,250? This considers the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for improvement:** While $10,250 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above the product's worth to Alice and higher than Bob's desired price. 
* **Bob can get a better deal:**  Bob has already shown willingness to negotiate, and Alice has shown flexibility.  There's a good chance Bob can get a lower price if he continues to counter-offer. 
* **Minimizing risk:**  Buying from John at $12,000 is a safe option, but it's not the most cost-effective choice.  Bob should continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can secure a better deal before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $10,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,750.  This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it's a significant step closer to my budget.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental approach:** Bob is increasing his offer slightly, demonstrating that he is willing to negotiate but still prioritizing a good price.
* **Emphasizing fairness:**  Bob is framing his offer as fair, referencing the product's value and his budget constraints.
* **Positive and collaborative tone:**  The message uses a positive tone and emphasizes finding a solution together, creating a more constructive atmosphere for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm aiming for a price closer to $10,000.  Would you consider $10,000? This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget concerns. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the desired price:** $10,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and is only $500 higher than Bob's last counteroffer.
* **Minimizing risk:**  While Bob might be able to get an even lower price with further negotiation, accepting this offer is relatively low risk.  Further negotiation could lead to Alice walking away or taking more time, which could result in Bob paying more or losing the opportunity to buy the product altogether.
* **Better than John's offer:**  $10,000 is significantly lower than John's offer of $12,000, making this the most cost-effective option at this point in the negotiation."
