``` 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a reasonable starting point,  above my minimum of $15,000 but not excessively high. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I will counteroffer and see if we can find a price we both agree on."

I'm lowering my price to $17,000, which is still higher than Bob's offer but closer to his price point. I'm hoping this will encourage him to come closer to my target."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to get closer to my target price."

I'm lowering my price again to $16,000. This is a significant compromise, but I believe it's a fair price considering Bob's counteroffers. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum and also slightly higher than John's offer. It's worth accepting to avoid further negotiation and potential delays."
