"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you thinking of me, but $175 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $175 might be a bit out of your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $155. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $155 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $140? That's a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $140 is still a bit below my minimum price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $145. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",145.0,Alice,5,
