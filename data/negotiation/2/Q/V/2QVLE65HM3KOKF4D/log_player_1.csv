Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's position:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, but Alice has a buffer before hitting her minimum.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Alice knows John will buy the product for $1,000,000. This knowledge gives her leverage to aim higher with Bob. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If Alice knows Bob is a tough negotiator, she might start even higher. 
* **Relationship:**  If a long-term business relationship with Bob is important, a slightly more generous offer might be strategic."
