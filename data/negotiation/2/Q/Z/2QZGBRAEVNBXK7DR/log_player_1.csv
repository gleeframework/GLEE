Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but still leaving room for negotiation.  Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000, this offer is a significant stretch for him. If he rejects, I'll adjust my counteroffer based on his response and how eager I am to sell to him rather than John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm not desperate to sell yet. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still leaving room for negotiation.  This price is closer to Bob's offer, making it more likely he'll accept. I'm still hopeful I can get a bit more, but if Bob rejects again, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm comfortable accepting this offer as it's only $50,000 below my ideal price. Further negotiation might lead to a higher price, but the risk of losing the deal to John isn't worth it."
