{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $110 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving some room for negotiation. This initial offer gives me a good chance to get close to my minimum price while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

I'm offering $100, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still keeping the price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $92 for it, which is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $92 is closer to my minimum price than Bob's previous offer, it's still not enough. I'm going to choose to sell the product to John for $120, which is my minimum price and guarantees I don't lose money."
