{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $9,500, which is a bit above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and enthusiastic tone to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm not being overly aggressive, leaving room for Bob to counteroffer if needed.
* **Back up plan:**  I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $10,000, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $8,500 is a decent price, it's still significantly below my minimum of $10,000.
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John's offer as leverage:** Knowing I have a backup offer of $10,000 gives me the confidence to hold out for a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate further.  However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum.
* **Emphasizing value:**  I'm reminding Bob that this is a good deal for him as well, encouraging him to compromise.
* **Staying firm:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to drastically lower my price just yet.  I still have John as an alternative buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, but I really like the product. Can you meet me at $8,800? That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe there's still a small window to negotiate and get a price closer to my target.
* **John's offer as leverage:** I can always sell to John for $10,000, which gives me the confidence to hold out for a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your continued interest.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $9,400. This is a fair price for both of us and allows me to move forward with the sale.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9400}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:** This is my final offer, showing flexibility while still maintaining a price above my minimum.
* **""Split the difference"" tactic:** This is a common negotiation strategy that appeals to a sense of fairness.
* **Urgency:** The message suggests that this is the best price I can offer, encouraging Bob to accept to avoid losing the deal.
* **Still above John's offer:** While this is a lower price than my initial target, it's still significantly higher than what John is offering.  I'm not desperate to sell, and still have a good backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Can you meet me at $8,900? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not close enough:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still a significant distance from my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Limited negotiation potential:** Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better offer from Bob.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing the negotiation process is taking time and effort, which is ultimately costing me money.
* **John's offer is secure:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price.

By selling to John, I ensure that I get my minimum desired profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob, which may ultimately result in an even lower price."
