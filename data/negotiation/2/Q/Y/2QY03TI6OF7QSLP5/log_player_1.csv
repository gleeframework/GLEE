Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

This offer represents a significant profit for me while still leaving some room for negotiation. Bob is likely to find this price attractive as it is significantly lower than the value he places on the product. This offer also allows for potential counter-offers from Bob, giving us a chance to find a price that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my target price and what I know the product is worth to Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiations and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm offering Bob a price of $850,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's current offer. It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also ensuring I get a price that reflects the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unattractive, and I'm concerned that continuing to negotiate with him will only result in further price reductions.  Selling to John for $800,000 guarantees me a profit and minimizes the risk of further negotiation."
