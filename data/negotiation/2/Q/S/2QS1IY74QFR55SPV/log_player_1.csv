{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a unique opportunity and I believe this price reflects its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation and potential compromise.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This price gives Bob some leverage to make a counteroffer without feeling like I'm being unreasonable.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product, encouraging Bob to consider my offer seriously.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer sets the stage for a potentially profitable negotiation. It allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially reach a final price closer to my ideal $1,200,000. However, I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob proves to be too difficult to negotiate with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is lower than my desired price:** While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still aiming for a higher profit.
* **Room for counteroffer:** There's still some room to negotiate with Bob. I can make a counteroffer that's closer to my target price and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Selling to John is not the best option yet:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be a safe option, but it wouldn't maximize my profit. I still believe I can get a better price from Bob.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I'm showing him that I'm serious about getting the best possible price for my product. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm not desperate to sell at his price. This approach will put pressure on Bob to consider my counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still a little lower than what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,125,000?  This price reflects the unique value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if you're open to this compromise."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and meeting halfway:** My counteroffer is exactly in the middle of my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise while still getting closer to my desired price.
* **Highlighting value and fairness:** I reiterate the unique value of the product while emphasizing fairness, making the offer more appealing to Bob.
* **Open communication and encouragement:** The message is positive and encourages further negotiation, leaving the door open for a final agreement.

**Strategy:**

By making a counteroffer that's closer to my target price, I'm putting the pressure back on Bob. This strategy aims to reach a final price that's closer to my desired $1,200,000 while still maintaining a positive and collaborative negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,080,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While $1,080,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, I'm still not happy with it. I'm aiming to get closer to my target price of $1,200,000.
* **Risk of selling to John:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a tempting option, but I'm still confident I can get a better price from Bob.
* **Room for counteroffer:** I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob and reach a price that's more favorable for me. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm showing him that I'm not desperate to sell and that I'm still willing to negotiate. This approach puts the pressure back on Bob to consider my next counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time.  I'm prepared to accept $1,100,000 for the product.  This price acknowledges both the value of the product and your commitment to a fair transaction.  Let's call it a deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:**  This offer is a compromise, conceding slightly from my previous counteroffer but still above Bob's last offer. 
* **Showcasing flexibility:** It demonstrates my willingness to be reasonable and reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Closing the deal:** The message is positive and encouraging, suggesting a finality to the negotiation, hoping to motivate Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

This final counteroffer aims to close the deal. I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to be flexible but also firm on my bottom line. This strategy aims to reach a final agreement that is acceptable for both parties while maximizing my profit. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely move to sell to John, as there's not much room for further negotiation."
