I'm offering the product to Bob for $950,000. This leaves a significant profit margin for me while still being a good deal for Bob, considering his valuation of $1,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $900,000. This is a fair compromise, still leaving me with a good profit while being closer to Bob's valuation. I believe this is a reasonable price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $820,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'll accept his offer to secure a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
