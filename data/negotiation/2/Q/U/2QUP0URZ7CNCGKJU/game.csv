"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a significant amount, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this deal.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is a significant amount, it unfortunately doesn't meet my minimum price point.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price still reflects the value of the product to you, and I believe it allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point.  However, $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is my maximum budget and I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product.  This is a final offer from my side, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
