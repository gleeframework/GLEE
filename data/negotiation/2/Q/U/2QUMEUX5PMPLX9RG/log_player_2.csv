"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this valuable item, and I believe you'll find it well worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $900,000 is a decent price, there's room for negotiation.  Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it and allows for a comfortable profit margin for both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable accepting $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is still within Bob's budget of $1,200,000 and represents a significant savings compared to buying from John.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject his counteroffer and he'll be forced to buy from John at a much higher price. Accepting this offer ensures a good deal for Bob."
