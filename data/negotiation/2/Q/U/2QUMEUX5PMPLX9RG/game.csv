"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it and allows for a comfortable profit margin for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable accepting $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",850000.0,Alice,3,
