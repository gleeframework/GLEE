"I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. Can you consider that?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $750,000 is tempting, I can't go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $825,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $775,000. Can you consider that?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to go down to $800,000. This is my absolute minimum.  Let's close this deal.  It's a great price for a product you value highly.",800000.0,Alice,5,
