"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a significant price reduction from its true value, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the benefits it offers. What do you think?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. I think the product is worth less than $1,250,000, so I'll offer $900,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $900,000 is simply too far below the product's worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it reflects the value you'll gain from owning this product. Let's try to find a middle ground and close this deal.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your attempt to find a middle ground. However, $950,000 still doesn't reflect the value I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,050,000. This represents a significant investment for you, and I believe the product's potential will more than justify that price. Let's aim for a win-win and close this deal.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer, but $975,000 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000. This represents a significant investment for you, and I'm confident the product's potential will make it well worth the price. Let's find a way to make this deal work.
