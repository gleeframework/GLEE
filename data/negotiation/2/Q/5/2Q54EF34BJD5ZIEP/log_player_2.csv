"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $900,000 is better than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  Starting with a counteroffer of $700,000  is a bold move, but it signals Bob's serious intent to negotiate and pushes Alice to consider a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $850,000 is closer to his budget, he can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice. He is also aware that he can buy from John for $800,000, so he is not under pressure to accept Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now aiming to secure the product for the price offered by John, which is his maximum budget. By offering $800,000, Bob signals that he's willing to finalize the deal at that price. This puts the pressure on Alice to either accept or risk losing the sale completely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $820,000. This is a better deal than what John is offering for $800,000. While Bob might be able to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject another counteroffer and Bob might lose the opportunity to purchase at a better price than John's.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a price within his budget while also achieving a slightly better deal than what John offered."
