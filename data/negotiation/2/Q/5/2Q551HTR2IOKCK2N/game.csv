"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. Can you consider this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $1,300,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,300,000. Can you consider this price?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
