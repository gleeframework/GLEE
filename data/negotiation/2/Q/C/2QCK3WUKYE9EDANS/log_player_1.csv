Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know its value to you is significant, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $950,000. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly valuable."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially settling around $900,000 - $950,000.
* **Avoid Appearing Desperate:** Offering it for $800,000 (our minimum) might make Bob suspicious or undervalue the product.

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
