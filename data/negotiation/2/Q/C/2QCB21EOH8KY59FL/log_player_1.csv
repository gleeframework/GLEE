"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Its value is undeniable, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. This feels like a fair starting point given its potential.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Initial Offer:** Starting high anchors the negotiation in our favor.  Even though we know Bob values it at $1,000,000, there's a chance he might be willing to pay a premium.
* **Justification:**  We're not just throwing out a number. We're emphasizing the product's value to justify the high price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is collaborative. We want Bob to feel like we're open to finding a mutually beneficial deal. 
* **Alternative Option:** Keep in mind that we have the option to walk away and sell to John for our minimum price, giving us leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a more reasonable price. Considering my budget and the current market situation, I would like to propose a price of $800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both our valuation and his own perceived value. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. We have room to negotiate, and the safety net of John's offer allows us to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential.  To be fair to both of us, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection Justification:** We're acknowledging Bob's offer but standing firm that it's too low.
* **Significant but Gradual Concession:**  We're coming down $200,000 from our initial offer, signaling willingness to negotiate, but not desperation.
* **Reiterating Value:** We're reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the still-high price. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** We're still above both our minimum and Bob's stated value, giving us negotiating room."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I still believe there's room for negotiation. Based on my financial constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,100,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:**  While not our ideal price, $1,100,000 is a $100,000 profit over both our minimum and John's offer.
* **Strong Negotiation by Bob:** Bob has consistently moved towards our price, indicating a serious interest in the product.
* **Time Value:**  Each round represents a potential time cost.  Securing a good deal now outweighs the risk of losing Bob by pushing for a slightly higher amount."
