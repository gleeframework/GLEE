{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $13,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 13000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $15,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell it for a minimum of $8,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering it at $13,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price significantly above your minimum. This strategy gives you a good chance of securing a deal with Bob at a price that's very profitable for you. 
* **Backup Option:** You have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay $8,000, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
