"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it'll be a valuable asset. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While $12,000 is a decent price, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell and you have a backup option with John. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to get Alice to come down closer to her value of $8,000."
