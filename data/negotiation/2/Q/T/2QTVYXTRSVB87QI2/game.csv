"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110.",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate it.  However, $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm thinking $90 would be a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering you a price of $100. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit above my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $95?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $95 is still a bit below my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer you a price of $105. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit high for me. Let's try $98. This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",98.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer you a price of $102. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",102.0,Alice,7,
