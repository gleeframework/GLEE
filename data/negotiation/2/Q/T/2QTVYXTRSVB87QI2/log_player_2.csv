{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where Alice's offers are still above our target price of $80.  It's time to cut our losses and go with John's offer. While it's tempting to keep negotiating with Alice, we've already been through several rounds and it's unlikely she'll drop down to our desired price point.  It's better to secure the product at a reasonable price from John."
