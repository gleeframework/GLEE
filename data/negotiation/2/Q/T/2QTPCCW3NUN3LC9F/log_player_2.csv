"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us.  Let's say $10,000.  This gives you a great deal and allows me to get a good price as well.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $10,000.** This is still more than the product is worth to you ($8,000). 
* **John's price is $12,000.** This is your maximum price. 
* **You want to save money.** By rejecting Alice's offer, you can negotiate with John, potentially lowering his price or finding a better deal elsewhere."
