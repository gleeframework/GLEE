"Alice,  $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $1000000 at this time.  Let me know if that works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1250000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1250000 is still outside my budget. I'm ready to pay $1100000 for this product. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1200000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and the benefits it offers. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm open to negotiating further. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
