"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $1200000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1200000 is lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $1700000. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1700000 is still a bit above my comfort zone. Let's split the difference and agree on $1450000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. ",1450000.0,Bob,4,
