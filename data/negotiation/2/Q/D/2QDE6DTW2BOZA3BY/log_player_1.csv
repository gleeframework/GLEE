``` 

This offer starts with a slightly higher price than my minimum ($120) to leave some room for negotiation.  It also includes a friendly message to build rapport with Bob and pique his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is my minimum price. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
