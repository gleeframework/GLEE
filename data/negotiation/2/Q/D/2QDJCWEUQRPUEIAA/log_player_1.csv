I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,400,000 right now."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum and I'm running out of time.  I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely and having to sell to John for less than what I originally wanted."
