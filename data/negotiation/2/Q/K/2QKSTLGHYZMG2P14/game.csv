"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider coming down to $875,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $875,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $875,000, so I'm thinking of $812,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",812500.0,Bob,4,
