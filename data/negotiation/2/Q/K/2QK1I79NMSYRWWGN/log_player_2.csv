Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your position, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,100,000?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing a significant gap between our valuations.  While I'm aiming for a deal, I have to be mindful of the product's true value.  My final offer is $950,000. This is a considerable compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has come down in price, but her ""final offer"" of $950,000 is still significantly higher than John's offer of $800,000. It's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the guaranteed deal with John. It makes more financial sense to cut your losses and buy from John at this point."
