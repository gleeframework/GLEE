"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your position, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $1,100,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  I could go up to $700,000. I believe that's a fair offer considering its value to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a significant gap between our valuations.  While I'm aiming for a deal, I have to be mindful of the product's true value.  My final offer is $950,000. This is a considerable compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,5,
