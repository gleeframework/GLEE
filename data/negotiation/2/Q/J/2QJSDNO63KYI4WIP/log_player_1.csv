Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, but he's still significantly below our minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. At this point, continuing the negotiation is unlikely to yield a satisfactory outcome. 

We have a guaranteed offer from John for our desired price. It makes more sense to cut our losses with Bob and secure the sale with John."
