"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire this truly valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for discussions.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the product's value is significantly higher than your proposed price. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. I believe this offer reflects the product's true worth while considering your interest.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but the gap between our valuations remains substantial. I'm willing to make another adjustment and lower the price to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a significant concession on my part while still respecting the product's inherent value.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
