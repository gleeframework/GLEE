Round 2
Bob's offer:

It's too early to sell to John. I can likely get closer to $80 by continuing to negotiate with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little to $85.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 85}

While $78 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price from Bob. I'll counteroffer again."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $82 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $79? I'm really close to making a decision, and I think this price would be a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $79
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer of $79 is very close to my minimum price of $80, and I've already had a few rounds of negotiation. It's time to close the deal and secure a sale."
