"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit though. How about $105?  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product but $105 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100? It's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
