"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  That's still a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.
