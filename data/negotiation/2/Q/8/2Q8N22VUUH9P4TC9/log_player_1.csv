Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Target Price:**  My ideal price is $1,700,000. This leaves some room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum of $1,500,000. 
* **Reasoning:** Starting high allows me to potentially secure a better price. Bob's maximum is $800,000, so there's a clear gap for negotiation. I can then adjust my price based on his response.
* **Plan B:** I'm always aware of my fallback option with John for $1,500,000.  This provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** It's far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and even lower than John's offer of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is still possible.** I will reject Bob's offer, but I will not sell to John yet. There is room for counter-offers, and I can still try to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Lowering the price slightly:**  I'm lowering my price from $1,700,000 to $1,500,000. This shows some flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum. 
* **Strategic move:**  My goal is to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway. If he doesn't, I'll accept John's offer as a backup.
* **Prioritizing negotiation:** I'm still hoping to secure a better price from Bob, even if it's slightly lower than my initial target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is unacceptable.**  $1,000,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's also lower than John's offer. 
* **No room for further negotiation:**  Bob has shown he's not willing to come close to my desired price. Continuing to negotiate with him is unlikely to yield a better result.
* **Time to move on:**  John offers a guaranteed price that meets my minimum.  Selling to John is the most logical and financially advantageous option."
