"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into acquiring it. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  $850000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $800000?  That seems fair to both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concern, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850000 and $800000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825000. This is my final offer. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
