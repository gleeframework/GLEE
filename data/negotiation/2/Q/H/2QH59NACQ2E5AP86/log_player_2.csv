# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $135. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135

Alice has come down to $135, which is a good price considering you are willing to pay $150 to John.  Accepting the offer saves you $15 compared to buying from John."
