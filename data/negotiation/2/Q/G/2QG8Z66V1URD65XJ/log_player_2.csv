"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a fantastic opportunity for you, Bob! This product is a rare find and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a one-time offer to you at a price of $10,000. It's a steal considering its value to you is $12,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Here's why:

* **Alice is bluffing:**  While Alice claims the product is worth $12,000 to you, you know your own valuation. Her statement is designed to inflate the perceived value.
* **Room for negotiation:** By rejecting the offer, you signal to Alice that you're willing to walk away unless the price is more favorable.
* **John is your backup:** You have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $12,000. This gives you leverage in negotiating with Alice."
