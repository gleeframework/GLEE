"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This product truly is worth the investment.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $10,500, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my means.",10500.0,Bob,4,
