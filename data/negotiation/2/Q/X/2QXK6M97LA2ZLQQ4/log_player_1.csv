"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe will be a great asset to you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This is a starting point. It's a strong offer, leaving room for negotiation but also ensuring you're getting a decent amount.  Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still do better by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  I'm confident that with a few more rounds, I can secure a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $13,250?  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $13,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $13,000 is a fair deal and significantly better than selling to John.  It's important to be flexible during negotiations, and I believe this is a good outcome for both of us."
