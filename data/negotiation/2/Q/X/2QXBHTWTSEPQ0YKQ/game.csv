"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of a price more around $1100000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1300000. I believe the product's value to you is higher than that, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's say $1250000, and we can call it a deal?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to go up to $1150000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're willing to go up to $1150000, Bob. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I was thinking that since we've been negotiating for a while, and I'm willing to make a bit of a concession, I can offer it to you for $1200000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so I'll offer $1175000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any higher.",1175000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet us in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still a bit above your last offer, and I'm not willing to go down to $1175000. I'm willing to make one final concession and offer it to you for $1200000, but I'm not budging from that price. This is my last offer.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
