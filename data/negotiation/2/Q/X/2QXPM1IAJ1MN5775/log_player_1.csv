Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $800,000?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $850,000 is still too far off from what I need. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $900,000? That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}
