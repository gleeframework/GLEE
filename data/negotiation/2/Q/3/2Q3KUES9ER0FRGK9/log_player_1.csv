Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but I'm not comfortable with the price. I've done my research and I believe the product's value is not quite there. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be reasonable. I'll meet you in the middle at $900,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your offer significantly undervalues the true potential of this product.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to see this valuable asset in your capable hands."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $950,000. This is my best and final offer, but I'm still very interested in acquiring the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is stubbornly fixated below our minimum acceptable price. His ""best and final"" offer indicates he's unlikely to move significantly. Taking John's guaranteed $1,000,000 makes more sense than risking further negotiation rounds for a potentially marginal gain."
