"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1100000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's fair considering the value you'll derive from it. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900000 is simply too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $1000000? This price reflects the value you'll gain from the product and ensures I receive a fair price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about we try $950000? I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to be closer to $1000000 to make this work. How about $975000? This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain and ensures I receive a fair price. Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.  If we can't agree, I may have to consider other offers.",975000.0,Alice,5,
