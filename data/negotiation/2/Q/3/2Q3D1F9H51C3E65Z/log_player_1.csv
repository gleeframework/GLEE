{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's fair considering the value you'll derive from it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is strategic:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value but below your minimum:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate but ensures you're still making a good profit. 
* **It's a strong starting point:**  It shows you're serious about selling to Bob, but also not desperate.

This is a starting point. I will adapt my future offers based on Bob's response and actions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. While I want to sell the product, I won't accept a price that's significantly below my minimum acceptable value.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This price reflects the value you'll gain from the product and ensures I receive a fair price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about we try $950000? I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. I want to see if I can push for a bit higher. I'll counteroffer again, but I'm getting closer to selling to John if we can't agree."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to be closer to $1,000,000 to make this work. How about $975,000?

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your latest offer, so how about we try $962500? I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.

While Bob is getting closer, I'm starting to run out of time and patience. This negotiation is dragging on, and I'm not sure if we'll ever reach an agreement that works for both of us.  John is a reliable buyer, and I'm confident that I can get a much better price by selling to him."
