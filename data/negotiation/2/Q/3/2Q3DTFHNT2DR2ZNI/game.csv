"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While the product does interest me, I'm looking to pay closer to its true market value.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  This is a fair price, and I believe it benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid $1,050,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,125,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's finalize this deal.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,125,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  To finalize this deal, I'm willing to pay $1,175,000.  This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal. Let's make this happen.",1175000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we're close, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,175,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $1,275,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. If not, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.",1275000.0,Alice,7,
