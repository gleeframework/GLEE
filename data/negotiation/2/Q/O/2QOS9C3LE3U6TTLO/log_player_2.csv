Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $700,000 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to drop the price to $850,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This is the lowest I can go.  Let me know if you're interested in finalizing the deal.

Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000, and you have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $800,000. It makes no sense to continue negotiating with Alice at this point."
