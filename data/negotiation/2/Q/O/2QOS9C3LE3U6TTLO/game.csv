"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we settle around $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll receive. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $900,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $700,000 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to drop the price to $850,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This is the lowest I can go.  Let me know if you're interested in finalizing the deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,
