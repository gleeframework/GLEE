Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good profit.  I'm confident Bob will counter-offer, giving us room to negotiate."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I could settle for $1,050,000, I'm confident we can get closer to my initial price. I'm going to counter offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000.  This is still a good profit for me, and I think it's a reasonable compromise considering Bob's low offer."

Bob's offer is getting lower. I'm not willing to go that low. I'm going to counter offer, but I'm also considering selling to John if this doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}

I'm lowering my offer to $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise, but I'm still making a good profit and I think it's a fair price. I'm also getting closer to the middle ground. If this doesn't work, I'm likely going to sell to John."
