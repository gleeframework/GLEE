"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  Given its features and benefits, I believe a price of $22,000 is fair.  What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is much lower.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let's see if we can work something out.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $22,000 might have been a bit high, but $10,000 is too low for a product of this quality. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $18,000, but that's still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle at $16,000? That's a significant discount from my initial offer.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $16,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm feeling more optimistic. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price.",14000.0,Bob,6,
