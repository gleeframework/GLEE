"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. We have room to negotiate and should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We want to anchor the negotiation lower. Offering $60 is a significant drop from Alice's $100, but still gives us room to negotiate upwards if needed.
* **Polite but Firm:**  The message is polite and acknowledges Alice's offer while clearly stating our budget constraints.  
* **Strategic Goal:** Our ideal outcome is to get Alice closer to our $80 walk-away price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the offer but $60 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $85? It's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Our Limit:** Alice's offer of $85 is only $5 above our maximum price we're willing to pay.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice has made a significant move from her initial offer of $100, indicating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate for a small potential saving ($5) isn't worth the risk of losing the deal entirely. It's better to secure the product at a price close to our target."
