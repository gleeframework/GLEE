"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1800000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to negotiate, Bob, but $1200000 is a bit low considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'll counter with $1600000. This is a compromise, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to offer $1400000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $1400000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'll counter with $1700000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to offer $1500000, but I really need to be closer to $800000. Can we discuss some more?",1500000.0,Bob,6,
