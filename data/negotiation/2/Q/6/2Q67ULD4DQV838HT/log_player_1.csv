"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start the negotiation at a favorable point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $15,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counter with a price closer to $18,000 to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to $17,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a comfortable margin above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I would have preferred to get closer to $17,000, $16,000 is still a good profit and within my acceptable range.  With the number of rounds remaining, it's not worth risking a further rejection and having to make another counteroffer."
