Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product I believe you would be interested in. It has significant value, and I'm confident it would be a strong asset for your company. I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000. This price reflects its potential and the opportunity it presents. Let me know if you'd like to discuss further."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've chosen $1,500,000 as the starting point. This is above my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is designed to be friendly and persuasive, highlighting the potential value to Bob without revealing too much about my own valuation. 
* **Strategy:** By offering a price higher than my minimum, I'm leaving room for negotiation.  If Bob accepts, I make a profit. If he rejects, I can fall back on the guaranteed sale to John."
