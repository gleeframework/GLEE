"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you've expressed interest in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to me is much higher. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $6,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000?  This would still be a good deal for you considering the value of the product, and it allows me to make some profit as well.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Alice,3,
