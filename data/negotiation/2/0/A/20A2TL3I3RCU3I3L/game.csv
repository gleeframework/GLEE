,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,400,000. Can you consider this price?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $1,650,000? I'm confident this price reflects the product's worth while still offering you a fair deal.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Considering your initial offer was $1,800,000 and your new offer is $1,650,000, I'm willing to compromise further. I'll meet you at $1,550,000. Can you consider this price?",1550000.0,Bob,4,
