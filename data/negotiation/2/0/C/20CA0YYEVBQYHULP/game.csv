"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $115?",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $115 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $122.50?  It's still a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need.",122.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, $122.50 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $120.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.",120.0,Bob,4,
