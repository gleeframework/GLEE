Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $115 is below my minimum acceptable price, and I want to see if I can get closer to my asking price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $115 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $122.50?  It's still a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 122.50}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
