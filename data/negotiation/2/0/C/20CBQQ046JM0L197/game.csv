"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being flexible. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $125? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $135? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $135 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $130? That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",130.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price. How about we meet in the middle again? I'll offer you $132.50. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",132.5,Alice,5,
