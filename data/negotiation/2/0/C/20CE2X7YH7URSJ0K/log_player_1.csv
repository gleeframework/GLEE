Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 to John, aiming higher with Bob could yield a better return. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The offered price of $950,000 is:
    *  Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still allows for a potential profit margin for him if he finds a way to leverage it.
    *  Below your guaranteed sale price, maintaining the incentive to sell to Bob if he accepts.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision."
