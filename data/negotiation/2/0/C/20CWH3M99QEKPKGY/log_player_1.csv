Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $18,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters. I'm hoping that Bob values the product at a higher price than $12,000, but I'm willing to take John's offer as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I want to see if I can do better. I'll counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $15,000. This is still higher than my minimum but lower than my initial offer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is higher than John's offer and is close to my desired price.  It's time to close the deal."
