Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Gauging Interest:**  The $10,000 offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. His response will reveal how interested he truly is.
* **Backup Plan:**  Alice has a guaranteed sale at $8,000 with John. This safety net allows her to confidently aim higher with Bob. 

**Important Note:** While this offer starts high, Alice should be prepared to negotiate if Bob pushes back. There's a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a successful sale."
