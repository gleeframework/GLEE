Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $150.  I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial high price will give you insight into his eagerness and flexibility. 
* **Alternative Option:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $100 with John, so you're not desperate. This allows you to be firm with Bob. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
