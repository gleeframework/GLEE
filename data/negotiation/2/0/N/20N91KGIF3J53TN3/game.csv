"I understand you're looking for a compromise, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,025,000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1025000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit.  $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $975,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it would be a good deal for you to accept.",975000.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you closer to your price, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $990,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're still interested, let's make a deal!",990000.0,Alice,5,,
