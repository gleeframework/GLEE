Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for this product. This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it reflects the true value we both see in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you believe in the product's potential, but $1,300,000 is still too high. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000, which is a fair price for a product with a real value of $1,000,000 to you. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Bob is unlikely to go any higher, and at this point, we're matching what John is offering. It's best to take the sure thing and avoid potentially losing both offers."
