"Bob, I understand your perspective, but my initial price reflects the true value of this product and the significant returns it can bring.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this offer represents a fair compromise, and I'm eager to continue our discussion.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm confident this product has great value, but my maximum offer remains $800,000.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your directness. To be frank, your offer is significantly below the market value of this product and the value it represents. I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,600,000. This is a substantial concession on my part, and I need to see some movement from your side to justify it.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
