"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should aim to get the price down further before committing."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for further negotiation. Bob can likely get the price down even lower. Buying from John would be a significant overpayment at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  However, $1,100,000 is still outside my comfortable range. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $1,025,000 for the product. This would give you a healthy profit and keep me within my budget.  I'm hopeful we can reach a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum sale price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer of $1,075,000 is significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000.  This offer allows Bob to save a considerable amount of money while still acquiring the product. While there is always the possibility of negotiating further, the risk of losing the deal to John outweighs the potential for minor additional savings. Accepting this offer secures a good price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations."
