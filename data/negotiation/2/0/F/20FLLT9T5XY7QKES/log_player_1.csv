Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1,300,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, reflecting its worth to me and my ability to pay. Let me know your thoughts.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but  $850,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this reflects the product's potential and offers a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and closer to your desired price. Let's see if we can find common ground.

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. It's time to cut negotiations and accept John's guaranteed $1,000,000 offer."
