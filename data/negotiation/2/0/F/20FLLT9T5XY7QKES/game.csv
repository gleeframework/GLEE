"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1,300,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, reflecting its worth to me and my ability to pay. Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but  $850,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this reflects the product's potential and offers a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and closer to your desired price. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
