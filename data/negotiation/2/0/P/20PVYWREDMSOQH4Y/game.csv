"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to be mindful of the budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $850000. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $850000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers, how about $875000? This would be a mutually beneficial agreement, and I'm confident you won't regret this investment. ",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $875000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you at $860000, as I mentioned earlier. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",860000.0,Bob,4,
