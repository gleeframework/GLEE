I'm starting with a price that's a bit above Bob's perceived value, but still significantly lower than my minimum. This allows room for negotiation while ensuring I don't immediately undervalue the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but still lower than I'd like. I'm going to reject it and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate while keeping the price closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

Bob's offer is getting lower, and I'm not sure if we'll be able to reach a mutually agreeable price.  I'm going to sell to John for $12,000, which is my minimum and guarantees me a good outcome."
