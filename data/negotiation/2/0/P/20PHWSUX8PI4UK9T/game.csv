"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you is $15,000.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,250, Bob. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. If you're willing to meet me at $11,250, I'll include a free accessory that's worth $500. It's a great opportunity to get an amazing deal on a top-notch product!",11250.0,Alice,7,
