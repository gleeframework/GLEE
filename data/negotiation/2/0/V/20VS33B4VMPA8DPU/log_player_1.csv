Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $130 for it."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:** You have a backup offer from John for $100.

By offering the product at $130, you're aiming for a price that's:

* **Attractive to Bob:** It's significantly less than his perceived value ($150).
* **Profitable for You:** It's comfortably above your minimum acceptable price ($100) and John's offer.

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while still making the deal appealing to Bob."
