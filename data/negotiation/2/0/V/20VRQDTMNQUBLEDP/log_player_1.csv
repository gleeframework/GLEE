Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer aims to strike a balance:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $80.** This gives you room for potential negotiation.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value of $100.** This makes the offer attractive to Bob.

By starting with a slightly higher price, you create the possibility of a successful negotiation without immediately cutting into your potential profits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can agree on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than selling to John, it's still below your desired price. By rejecting his offer, you have the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to your target of $95."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it's a great deal for a product worth $100 to you."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still not quite there with $90.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $87.50. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $87.50 is a good compromise. It's higher than selling to John and is closer to your desired price of $90. Accepting this offer ensures a quick and favorable outcome for you."
