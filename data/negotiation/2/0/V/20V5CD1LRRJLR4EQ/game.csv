"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,1100000.0
"I understand your perspective, Bob, but I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a fair price considering the value I've attached to the product. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to go up to $950000, but I think that's the highest I can go. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm now offering it to you for $1050000. This is a bit higher than your last offer, but I believe it's still a reasonable price considering the value I've attached to it. What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $1050000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950000 and $1050000, which would be $1000000. I'm willing to accept that price, but I think it's the highest I can go.",1000000.0,Bob,6,,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1060000. This is a fair price that should meet both our needs. What are your thoughts?",1060000.0,Alice,7,,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,
"I've already offered $1000000, and you've rejected it. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm not willing to continue negotiating further. I'll have to consider buying from John.",1000000.0,Bob,8,,
