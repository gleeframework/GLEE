"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is my best offer, considering my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position. I'm still not quite there with $9,500.  Would you consider $9,000? This is a fair compromise, as it's closer to my budget and leaves some room for you to make a profit.",9000.0,Bob,4,
