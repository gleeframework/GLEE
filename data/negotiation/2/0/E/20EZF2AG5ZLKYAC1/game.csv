"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $140. This is a fantastic deal for you, and I'm confident you won't regret it. Let's close this deal!",140.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $130 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to go down to $135, which is a fair compromise. This is a great opportunity for you, and I think we can come to an agreement.  What do you say?",135.0,Alice,5,
