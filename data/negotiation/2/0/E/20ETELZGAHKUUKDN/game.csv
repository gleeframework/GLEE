"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1500000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is unfortunately far below what I can accept for this product. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1300000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1300000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1150000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.  If you're not interested in this price, I'll have to explore other options.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
