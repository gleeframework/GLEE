Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,500,000 is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  He can try to negotiate with Alice, or he can just buy the product from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1000000 is unfortunately far below what I can accept for this product. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1300000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a lower price than her first offer, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  He has two options: he can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, or he can buy the product from John.  Since John offers the product within Bob's budget, it's a safe bet to reject Alice's offer and move to the next round."
