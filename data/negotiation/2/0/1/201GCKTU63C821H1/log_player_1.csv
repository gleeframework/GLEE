Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $9,500 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum price of $10,000. I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 isn't quite enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a great value for you.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not able to meet at $10,500. My maximum budget remains at $9,500. I hope this revised offer is more in line with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is stubbornly sticking to his $9,500 offer, which is below my minimum. I've already made concessions, and I don't want to risk further negotiation.  I'm going to sell to John for $10,000, ensuring I meet my minimum price."
