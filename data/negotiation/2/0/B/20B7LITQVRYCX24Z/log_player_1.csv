``` 

The product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and Bob's offer is only slightly higher than John's.  I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still above John's offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob."

Bob's offer is now higher than John's offer, and I'm willing to accept it.  It's a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
