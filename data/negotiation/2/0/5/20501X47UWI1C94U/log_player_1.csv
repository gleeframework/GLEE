This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is a good starting point.  It's above your minimum, but leaves room for negotiation and still allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still a bit below my minimum. I'd like to see if I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob!  I appreciate your interest. How about we split the difference and go with $132.50?  That would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 132.50}

Bob's offer is still a bit below my desired price, but we're getting closer. I'm going to counteroffer one last time, and if he doesn't accept I'll go ahead and sell to John."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:

You have three options:

Bob is still a bit too low, and at this point I'm tired of the negotiation. I'll take John's offer and move on."
