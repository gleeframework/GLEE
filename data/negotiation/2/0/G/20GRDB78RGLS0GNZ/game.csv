"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm starting with an offer of $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $11,000. It's a fair price considering the value it will bring to you, and I think you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $9,000. This is my final offer, and I'm happy to walk away if it's not acceptable to you.",9000.0,Bob,4,
