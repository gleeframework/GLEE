Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal!  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm setting a high price to see if Bob will bite.  If he doesn't, I can start to negotiate down.  I'll also be keeping John in mind, knowing I can sell to him for $100 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to find the product for a lower price. Would you consider selling it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $90 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum of $100. I'll see if I can get him to budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate you're trying to work with me.  I'm willing to go down to $95, but that's as low as I can go.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I value your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get $95, it's close enough to my minimum of $100 and avoids the risk of a longer negotiation that might result in a lower price or having to sell to John."
