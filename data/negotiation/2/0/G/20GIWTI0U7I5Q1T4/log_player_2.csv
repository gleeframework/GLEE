"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Your max:** You're willing to pay $150.
* **Alice's price:** She's asking for $140.
* **John's price:** He's asking for $150.

While Alice's price is better than John's, you can still do better.  By rejecting her offer, you can force her to lower her price or risk losing the sale."
