"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I understand it's worth $800000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's very competitive.  I'm asking for $850000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its potential value to you.  Please let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",850000.0,Alice,1,
