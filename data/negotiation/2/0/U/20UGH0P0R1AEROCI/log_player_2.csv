``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation to potentially get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer, potentially saving more money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,400,000 is my final offer. This still leaves significant room for profit for you. Let me know if you're interested in closing this deal.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is still a good deal. While I can try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice will hold firm at this price. Buying from John for $1,500,000 would be more expensive. Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option to save money."
