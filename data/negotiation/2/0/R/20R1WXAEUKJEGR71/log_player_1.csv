Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I think this is a fair deal considering its worth."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making that your absolute floor.
* **Maximizing Profit:** To maximize your profit, you should aim for a price significantly higher than your minimum but still appealing to Bob. 
* **The Offer:** $1,400,000 leaves Bob with a $100,000 profit margin, which is a strong incentive for him to accept. This price also nets you a significant $400,000 profit over your alternative deal.

This strategy balances risk and reward. While a higher price is tempting, it increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer, forcing you to accept the lower guaranteed price."
