Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's valued at $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value it brings to you."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not ready to settle for that amount yet.  I believe I can push for a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  There are still rounds remaining, and I have the option to sell to John for a much higher price if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer.  This price reflects the value you'll gain from the product while also ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need a fair price, but $1,250,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000, which is a reasonable compromise.  This offers a good return for you while allowing me to stay within my price range. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to continue negotiating for a better deal. I have several rounds left and the option to sell to John for a much higher price if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you have budget constraints, but $1,150,000 is still too far below what this product is worth to me. I'm willing to make a final concession and come down to $1,200,000. This is a fair price that considers your needs while also ensuring I receive a reasonable return. Let's see if we can reach a conclusion."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,175,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This would ensure you get a decent return, while still allowing me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach a final agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are now at round 6 and Bob's offer of $1,175,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While there are only 4 rounds left, it's unlikely that I'll be able to convince Bob to significantly increase his offer. I would rather secure the guaranteed sale to John at a much higher price.  Therefore, it is in my best interest to sell to John now."
