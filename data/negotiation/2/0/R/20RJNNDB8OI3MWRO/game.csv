"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer.  This price reflects the value you'll gain from the product while also ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment. Let's see if we can agree on this.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  I understand you have budget constraints, but $1,150,000 is still too far below what this product is worth to me. I'm willing to make a final concession and come down to $1,200,000. This is a fair price that considers your needs while also ensuring I receive a reasonable return. Let's see if we can reach a conclusion.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
