Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'd be happy to pay $90 for it.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $100 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my offer of $90.  Let me know if you're willing to accept that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

Bob is holding firm at $90 and doesn't seem likely to budge.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $120 from John."
