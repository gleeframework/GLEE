"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 
While $1,800,000 is a good offer, I believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob in the next few rounds."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you believe the product has great potential, but I still think $1,800,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,950,000. This is my final offer, Alice. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

This is a tricky one. Bob is clearly signaling this is his best offer, but it's still a significant amount below my initial ask.  I'll risk one more counteroffer to see if I can push him a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,950,000 is very close to what I need to make this work. Would you be willing to settle at $2,000,000 even? I'm confident you'll see a significant return on this investment."",
""product_price"": 2000000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $1,900,000, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. This is my last offer, so I hope we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is holding firm, and while I'd like to get to $2,000,000, securing $1,900,000 is a good outcome at this point. It's better to take this offer now than risk him lowering his offer further or walking away completely."
