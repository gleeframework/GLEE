"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product.  I value this product highly, but I'm open to discussing a price that benefits us both. To start the conversation, I propose a price of $1,150,000. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it. ",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm willing to move a bit from my initial offer. How about we settle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down from your initial offer.  I'm getting closer to what I can do. How about we split the difference and land at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the true value of this product. Could you meet me halfway at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you place on this product, and I'm willing to meet you close to that. How about $1,025,000? That's a fair compromise.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
