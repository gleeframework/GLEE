"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a product that I believe holds immense value. While I can't disclose specifics at this stage, I assure you it's worth at least $1,000,000 to me.  I'm confident it can be even more valuable in the right hands. I'm open to discussing a fair price. Would you be interested in exploring this further? "", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High starting price:** I'm starting high, at $1,500,000, to leave room for negotiation and maximize potential profit.
* **Vague description:**  I avoid revealing the product's specifics, as this creates intrigue and makes it harder for Bob to gauge its true value.
* **Emphasis on value:** I highlight the product's potential worth, aiming to pique Bob's interest and make him consider its value beyond just the price. 
* **Openness to negotiation:**  I express willingness to discuss a fair price, demonstrating flexibility and encouraging Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned it holds to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While $1,200,000 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. Selling to John would result in a lower profit, but it's still better than accepting Bob's offer right now. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price. There are 8 rounds remaining, giving me ample opportunity to explore better options."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. However, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me considering the unique value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price still allows me to realize a significant portion of its worth while offering you a great opportunity. Let's find common ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer within range:** I'm offering a counter-offer of $1,350,000, which is above my minimum of $1,000,000 but below my initial offer of $1,500,000. This signals flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Highlighting value:** I reiterate the product's unique value to justify the price. 
* **Framing it as a win-win:**  I frame the price as allowing Bob to secure a valuable asset while providing me with a fair return.  
* **Call to action:** I encourage Bob to find common ground and close the deal."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1250000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value you mentioned earlier. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still below minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation room:** I've already come down from my initial offer, and there are still 6 rounds left.  Rejecting this offer gives me more time to explore options and potentially secure a higher price. 
* **Avoiding settling:**  While selling to John for $1,000,000 is an option, I want to maximize my profits. Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me considering the unique value I've mentioned. I'm willing to go down to $1,300,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and leaves room for both of us to walk away feeling satisfied.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer closer to Bob's:** I'm offering a counter-offer of $1,300,000, which is closer to Bob's last offer. This signals my willingness to compromise while still maintaining a price above my minimum.
* **Emphasizing value again:**  I remind Bob of the unique value of the product to justify the price.
* **Framing it as a ""win-win"":** I highlight the discount from my initial offer and position the offer as a win for both of us.
* **Call to action:** I use strong language like ""Let's make this deal happen"" to encourage Bob to accept the offer."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

* **Limited negotiation room:** We are approaching the end of the negotiation with only 4 rounds left. While John's offer of $1,000,000 is tempting, I want to see if I can push Bob higher. 
* **Potentially better deal:**  Rejecting Bob's offer gives me a chance to make a final counter-offer and potentially close a deal at a price closer to my desired range."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on your offer. I'm also willing to be flexible, but $1,275,000 is still too low. Considering the value I've described and the potential benefits this product holds for you, I'm willing to go down to $1,290,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that we can both agree on.  Let's close this deal and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1290000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Small concession:**  I'm offering a counter-offer of $1,290,000, which is a small concession from my previous offer.  This shows I'm willing to meet halfway but still hold firm on my value.
