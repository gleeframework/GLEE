{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe this price is fair given the value of the product, and I'm confident it will be mutually beneficial. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$900,000:** This price is a good starting point as it's higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still leaves room for negotiation and ensures a profitable deal for me.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and professional, highlighting the potential benefits for both parties. This approach encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously.

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I will either:

* **Accept his counteroffer:** If he offers a price closer to $900,000, I might accept to avoid further negotiation.
* **Make a counteroffer:**  If his offer is too low, I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer.
* **Sell to John:** If the negotiations stall or Bob's offers are consistently too low, I'll sell to John for the guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product.  This price is still a good deal for both of us, as it allows me to acquire the product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $880000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $860000, which is a fair price for both of us.  This offer is a good compromise that allows us to reach an agreement.
