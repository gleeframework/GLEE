You have three options:

You should reject Alice's offer. You can get the product for less from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $880000, which still gives you a great deal.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's find a way to make this work.

You should reject Alice's offer.  While it is lower than her initial offer, you can still get the product for a lower price from John.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get the price down further, but you shouldn't commit to a price higher than what John is offering."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $860000, but I'm still a bit away from my target price.  I'm willing to offer you the product for $870000.  This price is a fair compromise, and it would be a great deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and make this happen.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

You should buy the product from John.  Alice's offer of $870,000 is still higher than what John is offering. While there's a chance you might be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice, it's not worth the risk of further negotiations.  It's better to secure the product at the lower price from John."
