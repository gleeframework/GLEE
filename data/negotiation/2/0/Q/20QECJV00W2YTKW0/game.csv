"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $125? ",125.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concern, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $135.",135.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go back to my original offer of $130. I'm willing to make a small adjustment and offer it to you for $132.50. That's the best I can do.",132.5,Alice,5,
