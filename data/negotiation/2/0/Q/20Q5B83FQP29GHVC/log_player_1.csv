"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,500 is a bit steep for me though. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your position, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  Could you consider $11,000? I'm trying to find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 11000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  How about $7,000?  That's a pretty big jump from my last offer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I could go up to $7,500. That's a fair offer considering John is selling at $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:**  Bob is stubbornly sticking to a price well below the product's value to both of us, and he's even trying to use inaccurate information to his advantage (John is NOT selling at $8,000). It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap.  Selling to John guarantees the best outcome for me."
