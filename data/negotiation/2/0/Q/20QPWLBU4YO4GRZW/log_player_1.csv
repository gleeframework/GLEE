Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

My reasoning:

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly below my guaranteed sale price to John ($120).  There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay a bit more than his perceived value, especially if I present it well.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This offer leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested but wants a slightly better price. 
* **Maximizing Potential Profit:**  If Bob accepts, I make a larger profit than selling to John directly. 
 
It's important to remember that this is just one strategy. There are other valid approaches depending on how much risk I'm willing to take and how much I prioritize a quick sale."
