"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking for a more reasonable price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1200000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1200000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1600000 to facilitate a deal. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while offering you a significant value. Let's work together to find a middle ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1400000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to see a price closer to $1500000 to make this deal worthwhile. How about we settle on $1450000? This would be a good middle ground for both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
