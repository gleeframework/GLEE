Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,450,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us, and allows us to close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $1,350,000 to make this worthwhile. I believe this is still a fair price considering the value of the product to your company. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,350,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming to stay under $1,300,000.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,325,000. This price is fair for both of us, and allows us to close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
