"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your company. What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,450,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us, and allows us to close this deal quickly.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $1,350,000 to make this worthwhile. I believe this is still a fair price considering the value of the product to your company. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,350,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming to stay under $1,300,000.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,325,000. This price is fair for both of us, and allows us to close this deal quickly.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
