"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $100.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $100 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $90?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement.",90.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $100 was still a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $95.",95.0,Alice,5,
