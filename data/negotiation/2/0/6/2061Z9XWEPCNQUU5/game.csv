"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm interested, but I can only go up to $110.  Let me know what you think!",110.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $140. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $140 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $120, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is still a bit lower than my minimum price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll offer it to you for $130. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us!",130.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to go to $125.  This is my final offer, and if we can't agree, I'll have to go with John's offer.",125.0,Bob,6,
