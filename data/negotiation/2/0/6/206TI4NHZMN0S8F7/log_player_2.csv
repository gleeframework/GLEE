Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $500,000 is a significant discount, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at that price.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm and willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $650,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $675,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

We've reached a point where further haggling is unlikely to yield significant savings. Alice is clearly committed to staying above $650,000, and while we could try to push her a little further, the risk of her walking away and forcing us to buy from John at $1,000,000 outweighs the potential reward.  $675,000 is a reasonable compromise and secures a significant discount."
