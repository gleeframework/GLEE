Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but  $1,400,000 is a bit high for my budget. Could we settle on something closer to $1,050,000?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,050,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,250,000, and I can get the product for my maximum price from John. It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed deal."
