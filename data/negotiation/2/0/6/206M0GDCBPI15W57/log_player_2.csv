"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is below your maximum budget, you can do better. You know John is willing to sell the product for $12,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or simply proceed to buy from John and save $500."
