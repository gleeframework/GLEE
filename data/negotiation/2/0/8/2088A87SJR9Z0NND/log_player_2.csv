Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. My revised offer is $1050000. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value of the product.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's new offer of $1,050,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,200,000 and still leaves room for Alice to make a profit. It's in Bob's best interest to accept this offer and secure the product at a good price."
