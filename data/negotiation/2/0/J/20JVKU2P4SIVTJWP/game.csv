"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's something you'll definitely find valuable, and I'm confident it will be a great asset to your business. My initial offer is $1,400,000. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for it.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to finalize this deal. What do you think?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
