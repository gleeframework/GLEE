"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the unique benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an offer higher than your target price. This allows room for negotiation and signals the product's high value in your eyes. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $2,300,000, we're setting a high anchor. While Bob may counter significantly lower, his offer is likely to be influenced by this initial high number.
* **Confidence:** The message projects confidence in the product's value, which is important in negotiations. 

**Important Note:** 

Throughout this negotiation, we'll need to carefully balance maximizing profit with the risk of Bob walking away. We'll adjust our strategy based on his responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your proposal, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I can afford. How about $1,400,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is quite good and close to his perceived value, it's still significantly less than our minimum and John's standing offer. We have room to negotiate further. 

We'll aim to bring Bob closer to our range without risking the deal by countering too aggressively."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your budgetary constraints, but the value this product brings to the table is truly significant. Let's meet in the middle; how about $1,950,000?"",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  By proposing $1,950,000, we're signaling a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's offer and our minimum.
* **Justification:** We're reiterating the product's value without explicitly dismissing Bob's initial valuation. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Bob's flexibility and help us determine our next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered Alice's latest offer, but I'm still looking to keep the cost as low as possible. Could we perhaps agree on $1,700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating he's serious about purchasing the product. 
* **Above John's Offer:**  $1,700,000 is now a healthy amount above John's offer of $1,500,000.  
* **Room for Negotiation:** We still have some negotiating power, as we're likely above Bob's actual limit (his perceived value being $800,000). 

We'll continue negotiating, but carefully. We're in a good position but need to avoid pushing Bob away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your offer is getting closer. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. How about splitting the difference and settling at $1,825,000?"",
""product_price"": 1825000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** While we hold a strong position, showing willingness to compromise keeps the negotiation moving positively. 
* **Splitting the Difference:**  This common tactic often feels fair to both sides.  
* **Testing the Waters:**  This offer will help us gauge how flexible Bob is willing to be as we approach what we believe might be the upper limit of his price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts in adjusting your offer. Based on my budget, I would like to propose $1,775,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:**  $1,775,000 is a substantial profit margin, significantly exceeding John's offer.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Bob's counteroffers are getting smaller.  It's unlikely we'll get him much higher.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate risks pushing Bob away. Accepting now secures a very favorable deal."
