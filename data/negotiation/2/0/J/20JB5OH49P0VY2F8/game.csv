"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be happy to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105? It's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal. Let me know your thoughts.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $95.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $95 is still a bit low.  Let's meet in the middle at $100. This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. It's a win-win situation!  What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,
