Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a better deal with Bob in the next round."

``` 
While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still too low for me. I'll continue to negotiate with him in hopes of reaching a more favorable deal, but I'm also aware that I can always sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see you're willing to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 still doesn't reflect the product's true value. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,450,000 as a final compromise. If you're serious about purchasing this product, I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and we are getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John. While I would have preferred to get a higher price, $1,500,000 is still a good deal, and it guarantees that I won't lose out on the value of the product."
