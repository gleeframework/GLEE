"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny at this price.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but $17,000 is still too high for my budget.  Could you consider $11,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
