Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product,  $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
