"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase [product name]. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your target price of $1,500,000. While it's lower than John's price, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product,  $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair and reasonable price considering its potential. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher than your offer reflects. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,275,000. This price represents a significant discount on its potential for you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,275,000 is still above your target price of $1,500,000, but it's getting closer.  Given that you can always buy from John for $1,500,000, accepting Alice's offer saves you $225,000.  It's a good deal, and it's likely that further negotiation will only result in small reductions."
