"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product,  $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair and reasonable price considering its potential. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
