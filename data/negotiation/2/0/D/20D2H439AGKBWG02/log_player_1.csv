"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation and ensures I get a profit significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I believe there's still room for negotiation and I'm willing to keep trying to reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm lowering my offer to $12,000. This is still a good profit for me, and I'm hoping it will be attractive enough for Bob to consider.  This is a compromise from my previous offer, showing my willingness to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go much lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $9,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I'm not willing to settle for a price below $10,000, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John. I'll continue negotiating with Bob and see if we can reach a better compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $11,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer and is only slightly above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to buy the product. It's a good balance between my need to maximize my profits and the need to make a deal before the time runs out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  While Bob's offer of $9,800 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, there's only a small amount of time left and I don't want to risk losing a deal with John. 

I'm confident I can get a better price in future deals, so this is a strategic move to secure a sale and avoid risking losing a deal altogether."
