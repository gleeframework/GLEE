"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $850,000?  That gives you a good deal, and still allows me to get a fair price. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a fair price, and I appreciate you coming down. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? That's a significant move on my end.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price.  How about we split the difference at $812,500?  That's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",812500.0,Alice,5,
