Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $850,000?  That gives you a good deal, and still allows me to get a fair price. What do you say?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price.  How about we split the difference at $812,500?  That's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us. What do you say?

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $800,000. It makes more sense to buy from John at your established acceptable price."
