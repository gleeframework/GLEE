"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me and still offers you a good margin. Let me know what you think!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering it's still a good deal for you and within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it leaves room for us both to make a good profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,
