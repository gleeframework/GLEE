Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe its value far exceeds $100, but I'm willing to let it go for $95. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $100, aiming slightly higher allows for potential profit maximization. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $95 makes it more appealing than the $100 John will pay while still giving you a profit. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By framing it as an exclusive pre-listing offer, you create a subtle sense of urgency, potentially nudging Bob towards a quicker decision."
