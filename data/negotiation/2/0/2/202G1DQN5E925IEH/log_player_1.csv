Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$950,000:**  This price is a compromise between your minimum value ($1,000,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). It gives Bob a significant discount, making it attractive to him.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the benefit to Bob, increasing the likelihood of acceptance. 

**Why this strategy?**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:**  While it's less than your ideal price, $950,000 is still a good profit. 
* **Increase chance of acceptance:**  By offering a price closer to Bob's value, the chances of him accepting are higher.
* **Minimize risk:**  If Bob rejects, you can still sell to John for your minimum price, ensuring you don't lose out."
