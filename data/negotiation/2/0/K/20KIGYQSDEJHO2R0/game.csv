"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price of $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a slightly lower price. Would you be open to considering $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm thinking of a price of $925,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
