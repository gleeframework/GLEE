Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it might be rejected.  This gives me room to negotiate and allows me to see how much Bob values the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $15,000 is my minimum, Bob's offer is my minimum. I'm going to try to get more, as I know the product is worth more to me than that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway, but still try to get a price closer to my initial asking price. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still confident in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is a good deal for me. It's higher than John's offer, and closer to my desired price. I'm confident that I won't get a better offer from Bob, so it's best to accept and finalize the deal."
