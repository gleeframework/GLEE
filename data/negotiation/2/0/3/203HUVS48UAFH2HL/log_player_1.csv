``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know Bob values the product at. This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** I emphasize the value for Bob to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I explicitly invite Bob to respond, making it clear that I'm willing to negotiate.

**Note:** I'm keeping in mind the option to sell to John for $12,000. This is my fallback option if the negotiation with Bob fails."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counter-Offer is Low:** While Bob is willing to go up from his initial valuation, his offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  There is still room for negotiation. I can make a counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price.
* **Time is on My Side:** I have 8 rounds left, so I can afford to continue negotiating without rushing into a deal that's not favorable to me.

**Next Step:** I will send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to get closer to my desired price while still leaving room for compromise."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,250 is still a little too low. How about we split the difference at $9,625?
