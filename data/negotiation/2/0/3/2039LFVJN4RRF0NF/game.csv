"Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can see that $180 is a bit high for you. Let me see what I can do. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $140. Is that more to your liking?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $140 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $120?  This is my final offer, as I can get the same product for that price from another seller.",120.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're in a tough spot, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I've already told you that I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $130, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll love the product.",130.0,Alice,5,
