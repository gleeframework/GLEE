Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is closer to my desired price of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel comfortable and open to negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to make it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** While I'm starting high, I'm still open to negotiation, and this price point leaves room for Bob to make a counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I'll adapt my strategy:

* **If Bob Accepts:**  Great! I've secured a good price.
* **If Bob Makes a Counteroffer:** I'll evaluate his offer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a counteroffer of my own.
* **If Bob Rejects:** I'll assess whether it's worth continuing negotiations with Bob or moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $12,000 for it. I hope this revised offer meets within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Room for negotiation:**  There's still potential for a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for such a low price.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to find a compromise. 
* I'll keep in mind the option of selling to John as a backup plan."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I value your business, $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my original offer.  I'm proposing $13,500. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I believe it's still a good deal for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating willingness to negotiate by moving slightly from my original offer.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the price as a fair reflection of the product's value to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Common Ground:** I'm emphasizing the possibility of finding a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Next Steps:**

*  I'll carefully consider Bob's response.
*  If he accepts, I've secured a decent price.
*  If he rejects, I'll reassess my position and decide whether to counter again or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice's position, but I am still unable to exceed $12,000 for the product. I would like to propose $12,500 as a compromise. I hope this offers a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Even though it's a slight improvement, it's not enough to make a deal worthwhile.
* **Time is Money:**  The negotiation has gone on for a few rounds, and I'm starting to lose patience. 
* **Guaranteed Deal:**  John offers a guaranteed price of $15,000, which is a sure thing and more in line with my desired value.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll move on to John and secure the sale at my desired price."
