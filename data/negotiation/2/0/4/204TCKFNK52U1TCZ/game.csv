"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not comfortable selling the product for $1,300,000.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to accept $1,350,000.  This allows me to make a decent profit while still being fair to you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I still feel that $1,350,000 is slightly above my maximum budget. Would you consider accepting $1,325,000 for the product? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
