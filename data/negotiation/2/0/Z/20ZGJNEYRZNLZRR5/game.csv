"Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $1,150,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price reflects its true value. Let me know what you think!",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. Can you consider that?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer,  $1,100,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. Let's try a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000.  It's a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $1,125,000. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  However, $1,075,000 is still significantly below my minimum. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000. It's a fair price, and I believe it's in our best interest to find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,075,000 and $1,100,000, which would be $1,087,500. Can you consider that?",1087500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I respect that. However,  $1,087,500 is still not in line with the product's value. Let's meet in the middle, once again. I'm willing to go down to $1,093,750. This offer demonstrates my willingness to compromise, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's worth.",1093750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,090,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",1090000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've really enjoyed negotiating with you, and I see we're getting close. However, $1,090,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,092,500. It's a very small step, but it's a show of good faith. Let's close this deal and both walk away happy!",1092500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher than $1,090,000. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm not willing to pay any more. I'd like to make a final offer of $1,090,000. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1,200,000.",1090000.0,Bob,10,
