Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go any higher than $1,090,000. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm not willing to pay any more. I'd like to make a final offer of $1,090,000. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough decision.  While I'd like to hold out for a higher price, I'm running out of time.  Bob has made his final offer, and it's clear he's not willing to budge. If I reject this, I risk losing the deal entirely and having to sell to John for a lower price.  So, I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $1,090,000."
