"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is your maximum budget, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,750. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",9750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $9,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to make a deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
