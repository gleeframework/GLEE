"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a special price. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product looks great, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it.  What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad you like it. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really interested in your product, but $16,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. How about $15,000? That's a fair compromise, and it's a price I'm willing to pay.",15000.0,Bob,4,
