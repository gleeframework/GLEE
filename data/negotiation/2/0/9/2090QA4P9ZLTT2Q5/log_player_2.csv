"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product at a price of $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential, and I believe this price reflects its worth while still being attractive to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Round 2

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  The product is interesting, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $1,050,000?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $1,050,000 is significantly below what I'm hoping to achieve.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still allows for a good profit for me, and hopefully, it's a more reasonable figure for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price, and I appreciate that. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a decent profit.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,250,000.  It's better to secure the product from John at $1,200,000 and avoid the risk of Alice not budging further."
