Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it holds great value for you as well. I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000, which I think reflects its potential benefits for your company. Let's discuss this further."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on this product. While I understand its worth to you, I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. My counteroffer for the product is $1,400,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to counteroffer and try to squeeze out more value. There are still rounds left, and I'm not in a rush to sell to John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,400,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum requirements for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price still allows me to gain a reasonable return while recognizing the value this product brings to your business.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your latest offer, Alice. While I respect your position, I believe we can find a more agreeable price. My counteroffer is $1,550,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is now within my minimum acceptable range, and it's only $50,000 less than what I could get from John.  Since I'm not guaranteed a deal with John, and I want to close this deal quickly, accepting Bob's offer is the best choice."
