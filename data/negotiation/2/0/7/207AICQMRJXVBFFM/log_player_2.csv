{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is very tempting, as it's significantly lower than your maximum budget. However, you're aiming to save as much as possible. There's a good chance Alice is willing to go lower, so rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation and potential for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for compromise. It's important to remember that your goal is to save as much money as possible, and a lower starting point increases your negotiating leverage."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is higher than your previous counteroffer, it's still within your budget and a significant saving compared to buying from John.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is clearly not budging much from her initial price. While this offer is still within your budget, you're close to reaching your maximum 10 rounds of negotiation. You want to try and get closer to your ideal price before resorting to John's offer.  Rejecting allows for one more counteroffer to potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a final attempt to secure a better price before potentially buying from John. You're raising your offer slightly, but staying below Alice's latest counteroffer. The goal is to find a middle ground and potentially close the deal. If this is rejected, you'll be forced to make a decision between John's higher price or accepting Alice's last offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to her initial price and is becoming more unfavorable. You're running out of rounds and the risk of accepting a higher price and missing out on a better deal increases. Buying from John, although at a higher price, guarantees you the product within your budget and avoids the risk of further negotiations."
