{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $130 for it."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that's halfway between your minimum ($100) and a price that is likely appealing to Bob ($150). This should give you room to negotiate while still ensuring you make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $110. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still worth trying to get a better price.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $120? That's still a good price for you and a fair deal for me."", ""product_price"": 120}
