"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more than my minimum value of $150. I'll be keeping a close eye on Bob's response and will adjust my strategy based on his counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $175 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $200."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 190}
``` 

I'm countering with $190.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $190,  $180 is a good price and we're getting close to the end of the rounds.  It's important to balance getting the best price with the risk of losing the deal and having to sell to John for $150."
