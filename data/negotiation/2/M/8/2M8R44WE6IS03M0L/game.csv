"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is still a bit high for me.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to offer $600,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to part with the product for $600,000. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway.
