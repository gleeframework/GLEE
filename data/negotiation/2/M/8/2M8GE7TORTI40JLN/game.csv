"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll find it valuable, but I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $900000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it currently, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further discussion.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1100000, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I believe the product's value is worth more than that. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still believe $1100000 is a bit high. I'm willing to bridge the gap and offer $1000000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and is a fair compromise. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1100000 and $1000000, so I'll offer it to you for $1050000. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
