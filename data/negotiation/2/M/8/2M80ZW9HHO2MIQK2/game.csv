"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a valuable asset that I know you're interested in, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering your asking price and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 isn't quite where I need to be. How about we split the difference and go with $1,350,000? I think this price is fair for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's close this deal.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,325,000 is still a bit below where I need to be.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,340,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the progress we've made in our negotiations. I'm confident this is a deal that will benefit both of us.",1340000.0,Alice,5,
