"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a valuable asset that I know you're interested in, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. While it's within your budget, it's still too close to John's price. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering your asking price and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 isn't quite where I need to be. How about we split the difference and go with $1,350,000? I think this price is fair for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my ideal price, it's still higher than I'd like to pay. I'm confident I can get a better price if I continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,325,000 is still a bit below where I need to be.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,340,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the progress we've made in our negotiations. I'm confident this is a deal that will benefit both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,340,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,340,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,340,000 is still higher than my initial goal, it's a good compromise. Continuing to negotiate may risk Alice walking away or me having to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids further haggling."
