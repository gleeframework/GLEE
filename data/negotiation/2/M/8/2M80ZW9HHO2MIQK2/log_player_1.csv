Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering your asking price and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's close this deal.
