"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $11,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,250 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference at $9,875.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",9875.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, you're clearly serious about this product and I want to find a way to make this work for both of us.  How about we settle at $10,000 even? This is my final offer.",10000.0,Alice,5,
