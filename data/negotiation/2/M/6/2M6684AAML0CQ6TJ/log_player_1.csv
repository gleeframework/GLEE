Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this item which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you first at a price of $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to haggle you down.
* **Gauging Interest:**  By offering it at $100, we can see how interested Bob really is. If he flat out refuses, we know he might not be willing to go much higher than $80.
* **Backup Plan:** We have John as a guaranteed buyer at $80, so we don't risk losing money."
