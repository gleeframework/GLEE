Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $115.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $115, which is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for Counteroffers:**  This gives Bob an incentive to counteroffer, potentially leading to a middle ground.
* **Protecting my Minimum:**  This price is still above my minimum of $120, so I'm not losing money if Bob rejects. 

Let me know what Bob says! ðŸ˜Š"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer, potentially closer to my desired price.
* **John is a backup:**  I know I can sell to John for $120, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $100 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $110? That's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate but I'm not willing to go below my minimum.
* **Fair Offer:** $110 is still above Bob's perceived value of $100, but it's also significantly less than my initial offer of $115. 
* **Positive Language:** I'm using positive language to keep the conversation friendly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $110, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $105 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to further concessions, and I'm not willing to go that low.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:**  Selling to John for $120 guarantees me a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations with Bob. 

It's better to secure a guaranteed profit than to risk getting a lower price."
