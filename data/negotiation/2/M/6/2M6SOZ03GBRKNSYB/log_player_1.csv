Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000 (John), you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Reasonable Markup:**  A starting offer of $19,000 represents a significant markup from your minimum, but it's still within a potentially acceptable range for Bob if he values the product.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down. 

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept $19,000. You might need to be prepared to lower your asking price slightly if he counters. However, starting high gives you the best chance to maximize your profit."
