"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $900,000 is still a little steep for my budget. Could we agree on $750,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product at a discounted price.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer. I can do $780,000.  This is a very fair offer considering John is offering the same product for $800,000.  Let me know.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're getting close to your target price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $850,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $780,000 and $850,000, so I'll offer it to you for $800,000. This is my final offer.",800000.0,Alice,7,
