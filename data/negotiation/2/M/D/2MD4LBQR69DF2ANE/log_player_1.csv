Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $10,000. I think this is a fair price considering its potential value to you."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $12,000, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $8,000 from John, so you don't want to go below that. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $10,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a price that's significantly higher than your minimum and still a good deal for Bob.

This strategy attempts to find a win-win situation."
