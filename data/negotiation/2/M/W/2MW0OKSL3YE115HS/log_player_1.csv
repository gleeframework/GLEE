I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This is a good starting point as it's a fair price for both of us: I'm getting more than my minimum price, and Bob is still getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum price, I still believe I can get a better deal.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm countering with $90. This is still a good deal for Bob as he values the product at $100.  It's also a fair price for me as it's closer to my desired price of $95."
