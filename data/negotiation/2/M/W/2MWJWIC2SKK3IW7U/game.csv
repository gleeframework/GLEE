"I'm glad we're still in negotiations, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $1050000. This is my final compromise, but I think it's a great deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm surprised you're still willing to negotiate, Bob. I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I've already given you a very good deal. I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer of $1050000. However, I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary service package that's worth $25000. So, the total price would be $1050000 for the product and $25000 for the service package, making it a total of $1075000. This is my final offer.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
