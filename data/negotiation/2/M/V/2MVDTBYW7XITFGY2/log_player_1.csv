{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product!  I believe it has the potential to be incredibly beneficial for your business.  My initial price is $1,000,000. This reflects the product's value and the opportunity it presents.  Let's discuss further and see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $700,000 is more than my minimum, it's still far below what I believe the product is worth.  I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm firm on a price of $900,000. This reflects the value I know you'll get from this product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? I think that's a reasonable offer that reflects the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price. It's better than selling to John, and I'm confident that the product will be worth even more to Bob, considering his estimated value of $1,200,000."
