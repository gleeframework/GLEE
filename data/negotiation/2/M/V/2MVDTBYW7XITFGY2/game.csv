"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm firm on a price of $900,000. This reflects the value I know you'll get from this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
