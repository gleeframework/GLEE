"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $11,500, which I believe is a fair price considering the value it offers. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",9800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to be flexible, $9,800 is too low for me.  I'm open to a compromise. How about $10,500?  That's a significant reduction from my initial price.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,250? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $10,250 is still quite a bit lower than what the product is worth. Let's meet in the middle at $10,400. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the significant reduction I've already made.",10400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $10,400 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up by $50, so how about $10,350? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",10350.0,Bob,6,
