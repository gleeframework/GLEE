"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it.  I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($120) to leave room for negotiation.  
* **Positive Tone:** Using a positive tone helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message implies flexibility, suggesting that I'm open to a counteroffer if Bob isn't satisfied with the initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $70 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  It's too risky to accept this offer, as I'd be losing a significant amount of money.  I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $70 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $100.  This still gives you a great deal on a fantastic product."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm counter-offering with a price that's closer to Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate.  $100 is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but allows for further negotiation.
* **Emphasize Value:** I remind Bob of the product's quality, subtly emphasizing its worth. 
* **Maintain Positive Tone:**  I use a positive tone to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $85 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I'm willing to negotiate further but not at the risk of selling below my minimum.  I'll reject the offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. "", ""product_price"": 92.5} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my last offer ($100) and Bob's latest offer ($85). This shows a commitment to finding a compromise. 
* **Focus on Fairness:** I emphasize the ""fairness"" of the price, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Reinforce Value:**  I subtly remind Bob of the product's value by saying ""I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $87.50. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close to my minimum, but Bob's offer of $87.50 is still below it.  At this point, with only 4 rounds left, it's becoming increasingly likely that we won't be able to reach a mutually agreeable price.  To avoid the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price or a complete failure to close a deal, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $120. This guarantees me my minimum price and avoids further potential losses."
