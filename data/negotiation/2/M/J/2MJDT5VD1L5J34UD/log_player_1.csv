Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but I believe it's a fair starting point, leaving room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not willing to accept it. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $17,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway.  I'm hoping he sees the value in the product and is willing to pay a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $14,000 is still lower than what I initially hoped for, it's just slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Considering the possibility of further negotiation, I believe it's in my best interest to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale."
