"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $175 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is above my maximum budget. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering! The price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's asking price, hoping to leave room for negotiation and reach a price closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $110 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $135. How about that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $135 is still above my target. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can meet closer to the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for considering my offer, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $122?"",
""product_price"": 122
}
``` 

I'm suggesting a price that splits the difference between her previous offer and my previous counteroffer. This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal."
