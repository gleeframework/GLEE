I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers.  It also reflects the fact that the product is worth more to him than it is to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While $10,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price point in the next round."

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with $11,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and his counteroffer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a higher price."
