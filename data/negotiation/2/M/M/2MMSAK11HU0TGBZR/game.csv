"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,000,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $980,000? I believe this would still reflect the product's worth while allowing me to stay within my budget.",980000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget, $980,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $990,000? I believe this price is fair and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",990000.0,Alice,3,
