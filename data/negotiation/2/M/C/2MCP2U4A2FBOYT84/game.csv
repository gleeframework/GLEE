"Alice, I appreciate your initial offer but it's significantly higher than my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $1,200,000 at this time.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but the price gap is still substantial. I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000.  This revised offer reflects my commitment to finding a middle ground while recognizing the inherent value of what I'm offering.  What are your thoughts?",1950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,950,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both the product's value and my financial constraints. Let's see if we can bridge the gap and reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price. To be frank, we're getting closer, but the gap is still wider than I'd like. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000 as a final offer.  I need to see a significant move on your side to justify letting go of this product at that price.  What do you say?",1750000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, and I'm willing to compromise. However, $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,450,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer, and I truly believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's find a way to make this deal work.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
