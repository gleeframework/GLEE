# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is far above your budget. It's best to reject and see if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly outside my budget. I'm interested in this product but can't afford that price.  I'm willing to offer $800,000, which is my absolute maximum. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, and I'm glad to hear that you're interested in the product. However, I need to make a profit, and $800000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be closer to my target. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1400000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to meet me in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is still too high, but it's getting closer to your budget.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer will give you more room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $1,400,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to go up to $1,000,000, but I need to stay within my budget.  This is my final offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're still in discussion. However, $1000000 is still below my minimum, and I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be closer to my target. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1300000. This is my final offer, but I'm open to discussing further if you're willing to meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your maximum, it's still too high.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer will give you the opportunity to try to bring the price down further.  You still have 5 rounds left, so there's time to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 as my final offer.  I'm confident this price is fair for both of us. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I've already made significant concessions. I'm not willing to go below $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1100000 and $1300000, so I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1200000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still outside of Bob's budget.  He's already gone through several rounds of negotiation and made multiple concessions, and it's clear that Alice isn't willing to come down any further.  

At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John for $800,000, as this is well within his budget and guarantees him a product within his price range."
