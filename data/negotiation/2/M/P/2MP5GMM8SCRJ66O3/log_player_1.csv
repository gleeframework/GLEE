"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally good negotiation practice to start with an offer above your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially secures a better deal.
* **Understanding Value:** We know Bob values the product at $1,200,000 and we value it at a minimum of $1,000,000.  The initial offer of $1,150,000 aims to capture a significant portion of the value difference.
* **Leaving Room:** This offer leaves room for Bob to counter-offer and still allows us to potentially negotiate down while remaining above our minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $1,150,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is above our minimum acceptable price, we still have room to negotiate.  Bob clearly sees value in the product, and we are only in Round 2.  Rejecting this offer signals that we believe the product is worth more and keeps the negotiation open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective, but the value this product brings is substantial. I could consider coming down to $1,120,000. This is a fair offer considering the potential benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1120000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We've made a significant concession from our initial offer, demonstrating willingness to negotiate. However, the concession is not so large that it suggests desperation.
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message reinforces the product's value, aiming to anchor Bob's perception above his initial counteroffer.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** The counteroffer of $1,120,000 keeps us well above our minimum price while still leaving some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $1,120,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,080,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product. Let's reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offers and we are still well within the negotiation window. While $1,080,000 is a good offer, we've only gone through four rounds.  There's potential to reach an even better deal.  Rejecting this keeps the negotiation moving and shows Bob we're serious about maximizing the product's value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product and leaves us both with a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This counteroffer strategically meets Bob halfway between his last offer ($1,080,000) and our previous offer ($1,120,000). This technique can often signal a willingness to compromise and expedite the negotiation.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** The message frames the offer as a mutually beneficial agreement, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and desire for a win-win outcome.
* **Maintaining Value:** While showing flexibility, we're still holding at a price point that represents a significant gain above our minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm ready to make a final offer of $1,090,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,090,000 is a significant amount above our $1,000,000 minimum. 
* **""Final Offer"" Signal:** Bob's language suggests this is likely his best offer, and further negotiation might be fruitless.
* **Time Value:** While we have rounds remaining, securing a deal now avoids the risk of Bob walking away or further lowballing the offer.  $90,000 above our minimum is a great outcome."
