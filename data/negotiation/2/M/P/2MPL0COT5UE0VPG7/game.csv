"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1200000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $900000 for it, which is a significant amount and reflects my interest. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1050000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
