"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1050000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

Alice's offer is still above your budget. You've already tried to negotiate and she's not willing to go lower.  It's better to buy the product from John for $1,000,000. You'll save $50,000 compared to Alice's offer."
