"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your life. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,100,000 for the product. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair starting point. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than what the product is worth to you. You can do better.  You should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is still a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than what the product is worth to me. However, it is only $50,000 above my maximum budget and is closer to the value of the product for me than my initial counteroffer.  Since Alice may not be willing to go lower, it's safer to accept her offer and secure the product at a relatively fair price."
