"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your life. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,100,000 for the product. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair starting point. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is still a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
