"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $1,100,000.** This is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* **Buying from John would cost you $1,200,000.**  This is more than Alice's offer.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John."
