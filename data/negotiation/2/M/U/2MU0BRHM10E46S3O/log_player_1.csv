Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I believe it would be valuable to you, and this is a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to $120 as possible, as that's what John will pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's really interested, but still gets you a great price. 
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning it's a ""special price"" might encourage Bob to act quickly. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider."
