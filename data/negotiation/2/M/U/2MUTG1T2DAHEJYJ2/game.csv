,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the deal, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $90?  That's still a great value for you, and I'd be happy to close the deal today.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm not quite comfortable going down to $90. I can meet you halfway, though. How about $95? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer $92.50, and we can finalize this deal.",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $97.50? It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $97.50 is still a bit more than I'm aiming for. How about $94? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal. Let's make this happen.",94.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you at $96, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love it.",96.0,Alice,7,
