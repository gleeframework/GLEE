# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has immense value and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to get your hands on this amazing product at a discounted price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $800,000 is a great deal, but Bob can likely get a better price.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. $800,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $700,000.  This product is worth a lot to me, but I need to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $900,000. This is a great compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's desired price point.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get the price down closer to his $700,000 target.  He can still get a good deal without having to resort to buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference and settle on $800,000? It's a fair price for both of us and avoids any further back and forth."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go back to $800,000. I'll offer you a new price: $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still gives me a decent profit, and I'm willing to consider it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is a fair compromise.  Bob has already rejected $800,000, so this is a good opportunity to close the deal at a price that's significantly lower than John's offer of $1,500,000.  Bob can save a considerable amount of money by accepting this offer."
