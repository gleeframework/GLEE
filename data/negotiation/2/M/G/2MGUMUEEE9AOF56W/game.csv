"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has immense value and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to get your hands on this amazing product at a discounted price. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. $800,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $700,000.  This product is worth a lot to me, but I need to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $900,000. This is a great compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference and settle on $800,000? It's a fair price for both of us and avoids any further back and forth.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go back to $800,000. I'll offer you a new price: $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still gives me a decent profit, and I'm willing to consider it. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
