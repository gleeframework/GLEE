Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,000. This is a price that is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. 

Here's the reasoning behind this offer:

* **Maximizing profit:** I want to get as much money as possible for the product. Offering $9,000 gives me a good chance of earning more than my minimum.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  Bob might be willing to pay more, but I'm not starting too high that he'll immediately reject the offer.
* **Backup option:** If Bob rejects the offer, I have a guaranteed sale to John for $8,000. 

By offering a slightly higher price, I'm hoping to entice Bob to buy while still having a secure fallback option."
