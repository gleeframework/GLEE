Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  This is a great deal, as the product is worth significantly more to you.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. That's still a great deal for me, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,250,000 is better than selling to John, I think I can get closer to my ideal price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking to get closer to my asking price. How about $1,350,000? That's still a significant discount from what the product is worth to you, and it would allow us to both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,350,000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to see a bit more of a discount. How about $1,225,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,225,000 simply doesn't work for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $1,300,000? This allows for a fair margin for both of us, and gets us closer to closing the deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tricky situation. Bob is offering my minimum price, but I've already gone through several rounds and haven't been able to close a deal.  With only four rounds left, I don't have time to keep negotiating with Bob.  It's best to take the guaranteed sale to John for $1,200,000."
