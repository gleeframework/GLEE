"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. That's still a great deal for me, and I'm willing to make a serious offer.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking to get closer to my asking price. How about $1,350,000? That's still a significant discount from what the product is worth to you, and it would allow us to both walk away happy.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,350,000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to see a bit more of a discount. How about $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,225,000 simply doesn't work for me. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $1,300,000? This allows for a fair margin for both of us, and gets us closer to closing the deal.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
