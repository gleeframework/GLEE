Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm hoping to get closer to my target price of $950,000.  I'll counter with a lower price, but still above his offer."

Bob's offer:

While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer of $880,000 is a good compromise. It's still significantly higher than what John is offering, and it seems like Bob is serious about buying the product."
