{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but it leaves room for negotiation and hopefully incentivizes Bob to make a counteroffer. I'll be closely watching his response to see how interested he truly is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While it's tempting to take the $800,000, it's significantly less than my minimum and less than what I could get from John. I'll counteroffer and see if I can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,200,000. This is still a good profit for me, but it's a significant drop from my initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate. Hopefully, this will be a more appealing number for Bob, and we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue negotiating, John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is a safer and more reliable option. It's time to sell to John and avoid any further risk of a lower price."
