Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $11,000, which is above my minimum price of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Not Too Aggressive:** I'm not starting at the full $12,000, as that might make Bob feel pressured and less likely to negotiate.
* **Positive Message:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, making him more likely to consider my offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies I'm open to discussing the price further. 

By starting with this offer, I can gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Improvement:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is better than selling to John for $8,000, but I believe I can still get a better price. 
* **Motivated Buyer:** Bob is interested in the product and has made a counteroffer, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** By rejecting his offer, I can show I'm not desperate to sell and can potentially push for a higher price.

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $9,000 is a good starting point, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. How about $10,000?  It's still a great deal for a product worth $12,000 to you."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing $10,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, reinforcing the value proposition.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging further negotiation. 

I believe this counteroffer is fair and gives Bob a good reason to accept. If he rejects, I'll have to consider selling to John, but I'm still hopeful we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a higher price, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Goal:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is very close to my minimum price of $8,000.  I've already made $1,500 more than selling to John.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  If I reject this offer and try to get a higher price, there's a risk Bob will walk away completely.
* **Time and Effort:**  Negotiating further might take more time and effort, and there's no guarantee I'll get a significantly better price.

While I would prefer to get closer to $10,000, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice. It's a good deal for me, and it avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
