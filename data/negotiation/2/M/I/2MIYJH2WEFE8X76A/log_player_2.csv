"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1200000.  It's truly a unique opportunity and I believe it holds significant value for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $1,200,000 and Alice's first offer is at your maximum price, there is no reason to negotiate further.  Buying from John guarantees you the product at your limit."
