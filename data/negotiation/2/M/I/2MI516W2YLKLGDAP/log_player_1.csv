Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still only able to do $80.  I understand you're firm on $120, but I'm not willing to go higher.  If that's not acceptable, I'll have to go with John's offer.

Bob is clearly unwilling to meet your minimum price.  It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap, and you have a guaranteed sale with John at your desired minimum."
