"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $170. This is above what the product is worth to Bob, but it gives me room to negotiate. If he rejects, I can lower the price in subsequent rounds. I am also keeping in mind the $150 offer from John, which acts as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $140 is higher than what he initially valued the product at, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm counteroffering with $160.  This is still above what Bob initially valued the product at, but it's closer to my desired price. I'm trying to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us. If Bob rejects again, I'll have to consider lowering the price further, but I'll still keep John's $150 offer in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $145 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product to him.  While I would have preferred $150, I'm happy to get a good price and avoid further negotiation."
