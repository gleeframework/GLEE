"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you engaging in the negotiation. While $1,800,000 is a significant investment, it doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product and its potential returns. Could you consider $1,950,000? I believe this is a fair compromise.",1950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand budget constraints, but my objective is to ensure a fair deal for both of us.  $1,700,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. My final offer is $1,850,000. This is a considerable compromise, and I believe it reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1850000.0,Alice,5,
