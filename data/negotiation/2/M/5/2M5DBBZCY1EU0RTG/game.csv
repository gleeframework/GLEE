"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,400,000 is significantly below what this product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while also considering your financial situation. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
