"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,700,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Fair Justification:** I'm providing a reason for the price, highlighting the value Bob would receive. 
* **Open-Ended:** The message is open-ended, inviting Bob to respond and start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am only willing to pay up to $1,400,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.** While it's tempting to accept, I'm aiming for a higher price.
* **I have more rounds to negotiate.** I can try to reach a better deal with Bob before resorting to selling to John. 

I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming to bring the price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,400,000 is significantly below what this product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while also considering your financial situation. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by lowering my price from $1,700,000 to $1,600,000.
* **Maintain Value:**  $1,600,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring a worthwhile deal for me. 
* **Appeal to Reason:** I'm appealing to Bob's logic by highlighting the value of the product and framing my offer as a fair compromise.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The message invites further conversation and encourages Bob to consider my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I've reviewed my budget again, and I believe I can offer $1,550,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 6 rounds left, I'm not sure if I can get a higher price.
* **Risk of Selling to John:** If I reject Bob's offer, I risk losing him as a buyer and being forced to sell to John, which would net me the same amount.

While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and minimizes the risk of losing out on a potential profit."
