Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $875,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible price.  While $875,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what Bob is hoping to pay. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to try for a lower price."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're still interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll come down to $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business and the time we've spent negotiating.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming to save money. While $900,000 is the same as Alice's original offer, Bob knows that Alice has already conceded some ground and may be willing to come down further. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to keep the negotiation going and potentially secure a lower price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up slightly from my previous offer, but only to $875,000.

Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 875000}
