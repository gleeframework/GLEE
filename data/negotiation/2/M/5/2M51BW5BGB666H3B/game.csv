"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a strong opening offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm looking to secure this product at a slightly lower price point. I'm prepared to offer $850,000. This is a fair price considering my valuation and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $875,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $875,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $850,000. I believe this price is fair and allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. ",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're still interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll come down to $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business and the time we've spent negotiating.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up slightly from my previous offer, but only to $875,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value we both place on this product.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",875000.0,Bob,6,
