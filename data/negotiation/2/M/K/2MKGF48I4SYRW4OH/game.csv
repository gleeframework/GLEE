"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As for the price, I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the value you're offering, $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a good value for the product. Considering your offer of $14,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $16,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle with a price of $15,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and allows for a profit for you. Let's see if we can close this deal.",15000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $16,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. If you're still interested, let's finalize the deal at this price.",16500.0,Alice,5,
