Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is way out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the inherent worth and potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair and reasonable price."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a tempting offer, Bob has consistently shown a willingness to pay significantly less than our target price. At this stage, it's more strategic to accept John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000.  Continuing negotiations with Bob carries the risk of him lowballing further or reaching an impasse, potentially costing us the guaranteed sale to John."
