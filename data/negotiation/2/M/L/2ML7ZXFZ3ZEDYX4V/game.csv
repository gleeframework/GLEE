"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is way out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the inherent worth and potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair and reasonable price.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
