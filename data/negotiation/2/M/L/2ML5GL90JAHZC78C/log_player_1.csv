{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $150, but I'm willing to negotiate. It's a good strategy to start with a slightly lower price to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $130 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  It's worth $80 to him, and he's offering $60 - I can do better. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is simply too low. How about we meet in the middle at $100? It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $60 was a bit low. How about $75? That's a fair compromise, and closer to what I had in mind. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $75 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer.  I'll try to nudge him up a bit more towards my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $75, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  That's a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
