"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it will be equally valuable to your operations. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,650,000. This price reflects its true value and gives you a solid starting point for negotiation.",1650000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but that price is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to buy it for $1,350,000.  Let me know what you think.",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,350,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  While I appreciate your interest, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This price reflects a fair compromise considering the product's value and your budget. I'm open to continuing the discussion, but I won't be able to go lower than this.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to a number that works for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,425,000 as a final offer. This price is closer to your range and ensures we both benefit from this transaction. Let's finalize this and move forward.",1425000.0,Alice,5,
