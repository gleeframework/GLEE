"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you today. I think you'll find it's valuable and I'm hoping we can make a deal.  I'm asking for $180 to start."", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer matches the minimum price I'm willing to accept. However, I have the opportunity to sell to John for the same price without further negotiation. It makes more sense to take the guaranteed sale with John rather than risk Bob changing his mind or further haggling."
