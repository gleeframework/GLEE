"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price.  How about $10,500?  That's a significant discount, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,800 is still too far below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference.  How about $10,100?  That's a fair price for both of us.",10100.0,Alice,5,
