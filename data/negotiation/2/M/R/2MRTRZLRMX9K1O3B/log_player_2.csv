{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Opening:**  Starting with a lower offer puts pressure on Alice and signals your serious intention to negotiate. 
* **Consider Alice's Value:**  $700,000 is significantly lower than Alice's value of $800,000, but still leaves room for a compromise. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This counteroffer allows for potential give-and-take in future rounds."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

* **You have 7 rounds remaining.** This is a good opportunity to continue negotiating and potentially drive the price down further. 
* **Buying from John is a last resort.**  You have a significant margin for improvement before resorting to John's price."

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still higher than your target.** You're aiming to get the product for $1,200,000 or less.

* **Remaining Rounds:** With 5 rounds left, you have time to continue negotiating and see if Alice will come down further.

* **Significant Savings:** While not your ideal price, this offer is still a significant savings compared to John's offer of $1,200,000.
