"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand it's worth at least $1200000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the transaction.  Let me know if you're interested, I'm confident you won't regret this opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is selling for $1,100,000, while John is selling for $1,200,000. 
* **You're still getting a good deal:** You value the product at $1,200,000 and are getting it for less, so you're saving money."
