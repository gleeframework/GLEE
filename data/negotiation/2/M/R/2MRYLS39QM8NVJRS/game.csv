"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only pay $8,000 for it.  Let me know if that works for you.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price between our two offers. How about $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $12,000 is still above what I can afford right now. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This would be a good deal for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close, but I still think $10,000 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle between $12,000 and $10,000? I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500.",11500.0,Alice,5,
