"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves some room for negotiation. I'm also trying to build rapport by emphasizing the value he'll get.  This allows me to see if Bob is willing to pay more than his initial estimate, and it sets the stage for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am looking for a price closer to $80. Would you be willing to consider a price around $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $90 is better than $80, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price if I continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $90 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $110? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my budget. Would $100 be acceptable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still a significant amount below what I want to get for the product. I'm not ready to give up yet, and I believe I can still negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $100 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $115, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a middle ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, could we agree on $105 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm confident I can get a better price, especially with just 4 rounds left. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired price and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable solution."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to go down to $110, but that's my final offer.  We've been negotiating for a while, and I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal and make it happen."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering my budget, could we agree on $107 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds remaining, I'm running out of time to negotiate a price closer to my minimum.  Bob's offer is still below what I want, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price.  It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $150, which is my minimum acceptable price."
