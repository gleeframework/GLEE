"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really appreciate its value. My asking price is $170, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 170}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $170 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I can still potentially get more. Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating and try to reach a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $140? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a price we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I really like the product, and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is getting close to my minimum, I can still potentially get more. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue to negotiate and see if we can arrive at a price closer to my desired value. I have 6 rounds left, and I don't want to risk selling to John for $150 when I might be able to secure a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $125. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value it offers, and it's the highest price I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price is too high.  

Selling to John for $150 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and secures the deal."
