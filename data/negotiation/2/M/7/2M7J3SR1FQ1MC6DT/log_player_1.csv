Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This gives me a good margin above my minimum value while still being potentially attractive to Bob. I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $180
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $180 is better than selling to John, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 190}
```

I'm countering with $190. This is a compromise from my initial offer but still a good price for me. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob and reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $175
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer of $175 is getting too close to John's offer of $150.  I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether, so I'll accept Bob's offer."
