"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a very reasonable price of $14,000. I believe it's a fantastic deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can potentially get a better deal by counteroffering.  $14,000 is still a bit too high for him, and he can likely get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm interested in the product, and I'm ready to pay $12,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the product is worth a lot to me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $13,250 is a good price for him, and it's lower than what he would pay to John.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee that Alice will lower the price again, and he risks losing the deal altogether."
