Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, I want to see if I can get even more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below my guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While my opening offer is high, it leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob counters. 
 
This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while still securing a guaranteed sale to John if needed."
