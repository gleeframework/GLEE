"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! I'm offering you the chance to acquire a product that's worth a great deal to you. I know it's valued at $1,200000, and I'm confident you'll see the immense value in it. I'm willing to part with it for a price that's fair to both of us.  Let's discuss a price that benefits us both.   
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,200,000. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this initial offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better price. This gives you a chance to potentially secure the product for a price closer to John's offer, saving you a substantial amount of money."
