Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum acceptable price:** $15,000 (John's offer).
* **Bob's maximum acceptable price:** $8,000.
* **Negotiation space:** This leaves a gap of $7,000 between our valuations.
* **Offer strategy:**  I'm offering $12,000. This is closer to my minimum than Bob's maximum, aiming to get a better deal.
* **Potential Outcome:** 
    * If Bob accepts: I earn $12,000.
    * If Bob rejects: I earn $15,000 from John.

This strategy maximizes my potential earnings while acknowledging Bob's potential interest."
