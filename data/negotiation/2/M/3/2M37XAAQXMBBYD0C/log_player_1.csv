{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price but still leaves room for negotiation. 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,250,000:** This price is a good starting point because it is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This gives Bob an incentive to accept the offer. 
* **Message:** This message is friendly and positive. It reinforces the value of the product and expresses confidence in a mutually beneficial outcome.

**Strategy:**

By starting with a lower offer, you can gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate. If he accepts, you've secured a good deal. If he rejects, you can counteroffer with a higher price, ideally moving towards your desired $1,500,000. If the negotiation stalls or Bob's counteroffers remain too low, you have the option to stop the negotiation and sell to John, securing your minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while your offer is tempting, I'm hoping to get a price closer to my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While it's closer to your initial offer, it's not yet a price you're willing to accept. 

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a higher price.  You can use this opportunity to counteroffer with a price that is closer to your desired price point but still leaves room for negotiation."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1,100,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1175000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,175,000:** This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer but still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price. This shows your willingness to negotiate but also reinforces your value for the product. 
* **Message:**  The message is positive and emphasizes finding a ""fair deal for both of us."" This builds rapport and keeps the negotiation moving forward.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while still leaving room for further negotiation. If Bob rejects, you can continue to counteroffer, gradually increasing the price towards your desired $1,500,000.
