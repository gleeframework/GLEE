"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,250,000 is a good deal compared to Alice's initial value, Bob can still potentially get a better price by counteroffering. He knows he can buy from John for $1,000,000, so he has a firm baseline to work with."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1,100,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's ideal price, he can still potentially negotiate a better deal. Bob knows he can secure the product for $1,000,000 from John, giving him room to bargain with Alice. A counteroffer could potentially push Alice closer to his desired price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,162,500. This compromise reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget constraints. Let's close this deal and make it work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,162,500.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been consistently trying to bring the price down, and Alice has met him halfway in this round. $1,162,500 is still a significant saving compared to Alice's initial offer of $1,250,000 and only a small increase from Bob's previous counteroffer. It's a good compromise and a decent price considering Bob can secure the product for $1,000,000 from John. Further negotiation might not yield a significant price reduction, and there's a risk of Alice walking away."
