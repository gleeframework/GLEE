"Alice, while your offer is tempting, I'm hoping to get a price closer to my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,175,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This offer reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
