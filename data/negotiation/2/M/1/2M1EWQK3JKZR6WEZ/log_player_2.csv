"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this product, which I know is highly valuable to you. My asking price is $950,000, which I believe is a fair reflection of its worth. This offer is exclusive to you for the next 24 hours.  If you decide to pass, I have another interested buyer ready to purchase it at a lower price.  Let me know your decision! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is trying to create a sense of urgency and implying a potential loss if you don't act fast. This is a common negotiation tactic.
* You have a backup option with John at $1,000,000. 
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price, especially since she mentions another buyer at a lower price (though this could be a bluff).

**Strategy:**  You're in a good position.  See if you can get Alice to come down closer to her value of $800,000."
