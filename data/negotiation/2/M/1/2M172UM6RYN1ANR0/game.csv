,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it.  What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, but $60 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $120?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $120 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider coming down a bit more? How about $80?",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but $80 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $120 to $80, so I'll offer you $100. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $80, and I'm willing to compromise.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, I'm on a tight budget and $100 is still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $90?  That's a fair deal for both of us, don't you think?",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $90, but I need to make a bit more to cover my costs. How about we do $95? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm getting closer to my minimum price.",95.0,Alice,7,
