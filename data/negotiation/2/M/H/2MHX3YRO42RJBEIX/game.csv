"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,200,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This would still be a good deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you, and it's still a great deal for you compared to the market value of $1,500,000.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $1,100,000? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.  I'm eager to finalize this purchase, so let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're serious about making a deal, Bob! However, $1,100,000 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll go down to $1,250,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you, and it's still a great deal for you compared to the market value. Let me know if this works for you.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
