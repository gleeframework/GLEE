"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe you'll find it's worth the investment. My initial offer for the product is $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for it. This would still allow you a significant profit while also being a reasonable price for me.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, I was hoping to get closer to the value you place on the product. My counteroffer is $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $1,150,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000.  This is a fair price that allows you a good profit while also working for me.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,125,000. This price still leaves room for a healthy profit for both of us and gets us closer to the value you place on the product.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're making progress. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This price is a good compromise and will allow both of us to walk away happy.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob. However, I was thinking that $1,100,000 is still a bit short of the value I had in mind. I'm willing to meet you at $1,120,000. This price is still a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth.",1120000.0,Alice,7,
