"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000 for the product. While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is lower than John's price, it's still higher than your ideal price.  Rejecting Alice's offer keeps your options open and allows you to potentially negotiate a better price with her or purchase from John if necessary."
