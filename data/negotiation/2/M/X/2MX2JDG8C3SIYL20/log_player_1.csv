"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9500 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'd like to sell the product, $8,500 is too far below my minimum value. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is still significantly lower than what I need to get for the product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm offering it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $9000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8750, which is a fair compromise. It's a significant step closer to your price, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum value. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need at least $8,875 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from it.  Let's close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 8875}
