```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8500 is still significantly lower than what I need to get for the product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm offering it to you for $9000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $9,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,750, which is a fair compromise. It's a significant step closer to your price, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need at least $8875 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from it.  Let's close this deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You should choose to buy from John. Alice's offer is still higher than your target price of $8,000, and you're nearing the end of your negotiation rounds. It's better to secure the product for $8,000 from John than to risk losing the deal and potentially having to pay more later."
