"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,000,000? This reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a significant deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise further. How about we settle on $950,000? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my financial constraints.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in this negotiation. It seems we're getting closer. While I'm aiming for the highest possible value, I also value a successful deal. My final offer is $975,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial asking price and ensures you're getting a fantastic deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to compromise. However, $975,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go a bit further, but I need to be careful with my finances. How about we settle on $925,000? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my financial constraints.",925000.0,Bob,6,
