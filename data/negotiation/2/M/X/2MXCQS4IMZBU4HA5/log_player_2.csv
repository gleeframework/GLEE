"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this product, which I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to let it go for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and what John is offering. It makes the most sense to go directly to John."
