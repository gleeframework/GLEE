"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  It's also important to remember that if Bob rejects, I can always sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. While it's tempting to take $110, I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation. I can always sell to John for $120 if this doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm offering a price that's still above Bob's offer but closer to my minimum.  This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price that's fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Even though I'm getting closer to my minimum,  I'm going to reject and see if he'll come up higher.  I can still sell to John for $120 if this negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
```

This is my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to take this offer, but I'm hoping Bob will finally accept it. If he rejects, I'll still have the option to sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum price, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  It's getting risky to keep rejecting his offers, as I'm losing valuable time. It's best to secure the guaranteed $120 from John rather than risk getting a lower price from Bob or running out of rounds."
