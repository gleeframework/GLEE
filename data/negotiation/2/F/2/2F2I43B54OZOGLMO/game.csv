"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $10000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I hear you on the budget, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. Let's meet in the middle at $9500.  This would be a fantastic deal for you, and would give me a fair return. Let's see if we can close this.",9500.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best deal, and I'm doing the same. How about we split the difference and go with $9150? It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.  This is my final offer, so let's see if we can close this.",9150.0,Alice,7,
