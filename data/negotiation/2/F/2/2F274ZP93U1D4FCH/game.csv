"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm willing to part with for a price of $120. I think it's a fair deal considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",120.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $60 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we settle at $75? That's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to buy right now if you agree.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is a good compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to sell it at that price. I'm willing to make one more offer. I can give it to you for $85, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll love the product.",85.0,Alice,5,
