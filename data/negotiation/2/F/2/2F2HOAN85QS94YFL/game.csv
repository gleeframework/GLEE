"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product, considering its value to me.  Let me know your thoughts.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $16,000. This is still a great deal considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to compromise and offer $14,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $15,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to me is $15,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",15500.0,Alice,5,
