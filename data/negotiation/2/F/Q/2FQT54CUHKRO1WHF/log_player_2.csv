"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is less than what John is selling for, there's still room to negotiate a better price. It's worth trying to get closer to Alice's value of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than her value, giving her some incentive to accept. It's also a reasonable starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to my desired price, and while I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk of her rejecting my offer again. This could lead to a drawn-out process where I eventually end up buying from John at a higher price. Accepting her offer at $142 is a good compromise, allowing me to secure the product at a price lower than John's."
