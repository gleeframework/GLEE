"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's something truly unique and I believe it has the potential to be very valuable to you. My asking price is $2000000, but I'm open to discussing a reasonable offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your budget.  You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  It's always a good idea to try to get a better deal, especially when you have an alternative option (John) at a significantly lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1000000 is below what I'm hoping to get for this product, I'm willing to come down to $1750000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the unique value this product offers.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still higher than your maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer gives you a chance to try and negotiate further.  You're still in a strong position because you have John as an alternative, and you've already established your top price point."
