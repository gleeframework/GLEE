Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I believe holds significant value for you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further if you have any thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to both you (Alice) and Bob, aiming higher allows room for negotiation and potential profit maximization.
* **Respectful Negotiation:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing value and openness to discussion, encouraging Bob to engage in a potentially mutually beneficial deal. 
* **Backup Option:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 from John, so there's no risk in starting with a higher offer to Bob.

By starting high, you give yourself the best chance to secure a price that exceeds your minimum acceptable price. Even if Bob negotiates down, you're in a strong position to secure a profitable deal."
