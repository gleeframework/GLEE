I'll reject Bob's offer. $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better price.  I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is unfortunately still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer.  How about $1,375,000? This is a fair compromise, and I believe it still offers you a great deal. "", ""product_price"": 1375000}
