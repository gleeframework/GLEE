"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  I'm confident this product will be worth it to you.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $95. Can we meet in the middle?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting closer, but $95 still doesn't quite work for me.  How about we meet in the middle again at $100?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I know you'll be happy with this product.",100.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but $100 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $98 for the product. Can we meet at this price?",98.0,Bob,6,
