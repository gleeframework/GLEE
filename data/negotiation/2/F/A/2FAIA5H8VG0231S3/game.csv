"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $130.  This product is worth $150 to me, but I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $130 is a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about $135?  This still leaves you with a significant profit margin, and it's a fair price for the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",135.0,Alice,3,
