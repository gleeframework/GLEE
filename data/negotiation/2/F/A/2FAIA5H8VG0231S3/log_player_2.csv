"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $140 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get the product for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $130.  This product is worth $150 to me, but I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $130 is a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about $135?  This still leaves you with a significant profit margin, and it's a fair price for the value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $135**. This is still lower than Bob's initial willingness to pay ($150). 
* **The product is worth $120 to Alice**.  This means Alice is making a profit.
* **Bob's goal is to save money**.  Accepting this offer saves Bob $15 compared to buying from John.

Therefore, accepting the offer is the best choice for Bob in this scenario."
