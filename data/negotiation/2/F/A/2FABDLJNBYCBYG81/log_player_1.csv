Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, I can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value, potentially justifying the price in Bob's mind.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he accepts, I exceed my minimum. If he rejects, I can adjust my price or move to John. 

**Important:** This strategy assumes I have no time constraints or costs associated with delaying the sale. If time is a factor, I might offer a slightly lower price to increase the chance of a quick sale with Bob."
