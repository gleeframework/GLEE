"Alice,  $1200000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal quickly.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950000 doesn't quite meet my expectations.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This price still represents a substantial value for you, and it's a reasonable starting point for a final agreement. Let's find common ground here.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
