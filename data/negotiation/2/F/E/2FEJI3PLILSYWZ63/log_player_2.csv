"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think you'll find it's worth every penny. Would you like to make an offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in your product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which still leaves you a good profit.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $920,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still asking for a price higher than Bob's desired target.  Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can bring the price down further.  Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer is the best course of action in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $920,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $880,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 880000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting the best possible price for this product. What do you think is the maximum you're willing to pay? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down on price, but she's still above Bob's desired price point.  With several rounds left, Bob has room to negotiate further and try to get the price closer to $880,000. Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer will keep the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to your asking price, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $890,000.  This is a fair offer, and it's the best I can do.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 890000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about making a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $895,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $895,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $895,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $895,000 is very close to Bob's desired price of $880,000.  With only a few rounds remaining, accepting the offer and closing the deal is the most strategic option.  Bob will save a significant amount of money compared to buying from John.  While he could continue negotiating, the risk of reaching an impasse with Alice and having to buy from John for a higher price is too high at this point."
