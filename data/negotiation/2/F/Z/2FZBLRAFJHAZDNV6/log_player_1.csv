Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90. It's higher than what the product is worth to me, but I think Bob will be willing to pay a little more to get it. If he doesn't accept, I'll be prepared to negotiate down, but I want to see if I can maximize my profit first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for anything less than what the product is worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm going to counter with $85. This is a compromise, halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows him I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still confident the product is worth more than $75."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, $78 is still a decent profit and  better than selling to John for $80. I've already had a few rounds of negotiation and it seems unlikely Bob will offer any higher."
