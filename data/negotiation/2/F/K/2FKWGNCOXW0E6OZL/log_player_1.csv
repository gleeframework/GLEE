This offer is a bit higher than what Bob values the product at, but it's still below my minimum value.  This gives Bob some room to negotiate while ensuring I still profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum price, but it's getting closer. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still above my minimum."

Bob is persistent, but I've already lowered my price twice and am still below my minimum profit margin. It's time to move on and secure a better deal with John."
