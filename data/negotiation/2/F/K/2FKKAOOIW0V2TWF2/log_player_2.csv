"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Buying from Alice saves you money:**  While $110 is more than Alice's value ($80), it's less than the price John is offering ($120).
* **Your goal is to save money:** Your priority is to get the product at the lowest possible price, even if it means accepting a price higher than the seller's value."
