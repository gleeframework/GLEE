"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11,000 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,250? It's a fair price that's beneficial for both of us. Let me know what you think.",11250.0,Alice,3,
