"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe is worth a lot to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than Alice's value for the product ($11,500 vs. $10,000).** This means there's room for negotiation. 
* **You're willing to pay up to $12,000, so there's still a buffer.**  This gives you leverage to negotiate a lower price.

By rejecting the offer, you can try to get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider $11,000?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11,000 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,250? It's a fair price that's beneficial for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's new offer is $11,250, which is lower than her previous offer of $11,500.**  This shows she's willing to negotiate.
* **The offer is within your budget of $12,000, and it's a good compromise.** It allows you to save some money compared to buying from John. 

While you could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and losing the deal altogether is high. Accepting the offer ensures you get the product for a reasonable price within your budget."
