Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it can significantly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. Let me know your thoughts and if you have any questions."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a High Anchor:** By starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,300,000 vs. $800,000) we aim to establish a high anchor point. This can influence his perception of the product's value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial price is high, it allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, giving us the opportunity to meet somewhere in the middle while still exceeding our minimum acceptable price.
* **Considering the Guaranteed Sale:** We know John will buy the product for $1,500,000. This knowledge gives us leverage. If Bob rejects our offer, we are not losing out.
* **Balancing Profit and Likelihood of Sale:** We want to maximize profit, but an excessively high price might immediately deter Bob.  $1,300,000 strikes a balance, aiming for a significant profit while leaving room for negotiation."
