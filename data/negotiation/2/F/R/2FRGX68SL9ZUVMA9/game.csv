"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth while allowing for a profitable transaction for both of us.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both parties.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately below the minimum I can accept for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, reflecting a reasonable compromise.  This still allows for a good return on my investment while enabling you to acquire a product that's clearly worth a lot to you.  Let's make this happen!",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. Considering the value I place on this product and the fact I can get it elsewhere for $1,200,000, I'm prepared to offer a final price of $1,150,000. This allows for a decent profit for you and secures a great deal for me. Let's close this deal!",1150000.0,Bob,4,
