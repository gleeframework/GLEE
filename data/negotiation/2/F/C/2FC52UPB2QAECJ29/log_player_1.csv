Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I believe a price of $1,400,000 would be fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit if he accepts.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,400,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), giving us room to negotiate if needed.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer to avoid missing out.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Depending on Bob's response and negotiation tactics, Alice may need to adjust her offer slightly."
