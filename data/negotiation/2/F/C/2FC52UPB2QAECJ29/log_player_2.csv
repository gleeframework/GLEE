"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I believe a price of $1,400,000 would be fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Even though Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. Buying from John for $1,000,000 is the best option for Bob."
