"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on it. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However,  $10,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This price is a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
