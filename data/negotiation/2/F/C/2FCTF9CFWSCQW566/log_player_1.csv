{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also expressing confidence in the value of the product to entice Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
