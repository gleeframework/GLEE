"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $170 for it. What do you think?",170.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $170 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $140? I'm really interested in the product, so let's see if we can find a price we're both happy with.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $140 is a good starting point, but unfortunately, I can't go that low.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $155. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price.  Let me know what you think.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $155 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $150.  That would be a fair price for both of us.",150.0,Bob,4,
