Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $9,000 is still significantly less than what the product is worth to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a fair compromise.  Let's try to reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $10,250. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,250 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. I think I can push for a bit more. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,750. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to close this deal now!"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $10,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm willing to compromise. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. We've reached a stalemate with Bob, and it's unlikely we'll be able to reach an agreement that's satisfying to both of us within the remaining rounds. It's better to take the sure thing with John and get my desired price."
