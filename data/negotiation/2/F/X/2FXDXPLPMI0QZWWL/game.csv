"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a fair compromise.  Let's try to reach an agreement that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $10,250. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. Let me know what you think!",10250.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $10,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm willing to compromise. Let me know what you think!",10500.0,Bob,6,
