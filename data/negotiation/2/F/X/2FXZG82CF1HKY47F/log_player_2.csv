"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a unique and valuable item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is $900,000, which is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. 
* You can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  
* Buying from John for $1,000,000 is worse than negotiating further with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $880000, which is a fair price considering its value to you.
