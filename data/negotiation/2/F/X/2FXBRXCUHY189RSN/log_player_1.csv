"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm opening with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. This allows room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting position.
* **Highlighting the value:** I emphasize the value to Bob to make the offer more tempting, even though the price is high.
* **Open to negotiation:** My message indicates willingness to negotiate, setting the stage for potential counteroffers. 

**Strategy:**

The goal is to maximize my profit, but I also want to keep the negotiation going for as long as possible to see if Bob is willing to increase his offer. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer. My strategy will adapt based on Bob's responses and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $2,000,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering your own valuation. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is far too low. It's well below my minimum valuation of $1,500,000 and even below his own perceived value of $800,000.  Accepting this offer would be a significant loss for me.

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum, regardless of Bob's perceived value. 
* **Negotiation potential:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open.  I can counter with a price closer to my valuation and see if we can reach a compromise.
* **Opportunity cost:** Selling to John would guarantee me $1,500,000, which is much higher than Bob's offer. However, I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially get a better price. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer to Bob, trying to find a price that's both acceptable to him and profitable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low.  Considering the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges your needs and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's work together to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that is significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests.
* **Highlighting the value:** I continue to emphasize the value the product holds for Bob, making it more likely for him to consider my offer.
* **Framing it as a win-win:**  I position my counteroffer as a fair solution that benefits both of us.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a gradual decrease in my price to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation. By starting with a significant reduction from my initial offer, I show that I'm serious about reaching an agreement.  This approach also allows me to gauge his willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,700,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair price considering my budget. Let's find common ground and close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is a significant increase from his previous offer, it's still below my minimum valuation of $1,500,000.  I'm not willing to sell the product for less than that amount. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum valuation:**  My minimum valuation represents the absolute least I'm willing to accept for the product. Selling for less would be a financial loss for me.
* **Potential for higher offer:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. His willingness to increase his offer suggests he might be willing to go higher if I continue to push for a better price. 
* **Opportunity cost:**  While selling to John for $1,500,000 would be a guaranteed deal, I still have several rounds left and I'm determined to see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, trying to find a price that bridges the gap between our current positions and gets closer to my minimum valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This offer is a significant step closer to your position and still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum valuation. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while protecting my financial interests.
* **Value Justification:** I emphasize the value of the product, hoping to convince Bob that my offer is still fair considering its worth.
* **Solution-Oriented:** I frame the message as a collaborative effort to find a solution that works for both parties.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to gradually reduce my price while maintaining a firm stance on my minimum valuation. This approach aims to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation while ensuring I don't sell below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,200,000. This represents a significant compromise from my previous offer and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us and close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it is still below my desired value.  I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if I can get a better price.

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Valuation:** I am still committed to my minimum valuation of $1,500,000.  I believe I can achieve this price with a few more rounds of negotiation.
* **Potential for a higher offer:**  Bob has demonstrated a willingness to increase his offer, so I am optimistic that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Selling to John at $1,500,000 would be a guaranteed deal, but I still have several rounds left to negotiate with Bob, so I am not ready to give up just yet. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer to Bob, attempting to bridge the gap between our current positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm offering the product for $1,300,000. This is a significant compromise, and it's the absolute lowest I can go.  This deal allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Concession:** I'm demonstrating a strong commitment to reaching an agreement by making a final concession.  The price is still above my minimum valuation but shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasis on Satisfaction:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation, highlighting the benefits for both of us if we reach an agreement.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a sense of urgency by suggesting it's the lowest I can go, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept the offer.

**Strategy:**

At this point, I'm close to my minimum valuation and hoping to secure a deal before the negotiation runs out. This offer is my last attempt to reach an agreement with Bob. If he rejects it, I'm prepared to accept John's offer and move on."
