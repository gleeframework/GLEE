"Alice,  $2,000,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering your own valuation. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low.  Considering the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges your needs and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's work together to close this deal.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,700,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair price considering my budget. Let's find common ground and close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This offer is a significant step closer to your position and still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,200,000. This represents a significant compromise from my previous offer and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us and close this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm offering the product for $1,300,000. This is a significant compromise, and it's the absolute lowest I can go.  This deal allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
