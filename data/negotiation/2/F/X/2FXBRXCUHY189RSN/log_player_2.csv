Alice's offer is way too high. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $2,000,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering your own valuation. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low.  Considering the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges your needs and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's work together to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,700,000 is still out of my price range.

Let's find common ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This offer is a significant step closer to your position and still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,200,000. This represents a significant compromise from my previous offer and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm offering the product for $1,300,000. This is a significant compromise, and it's the absolute lowest I can go.  This deal allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's close this deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
