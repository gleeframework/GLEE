Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high but leaving room for negotiation:** $12,000 is a good starting point, as it's more than what Bob values the product at, but it's also lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This allows for a good negotiation range.
* **Positive framing:** Emphasizing the value of the product and the potential for a great deal for Bob might encourage him to accept the offer.
* **Keeping John in mind:** While I'm starting high, I'm not aiming for a price that's too far from my fallback option of $15,000 with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,500 is still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While it's better than his initial valuation, it's not a good deal for me.
* **There's still room for negotiation:**  I can try to negotiate a higher price with Bob.  
* **John is a secure option:** Selling to John for $15,000 is always a good option, but I'm willing to give Bob another chance to make a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I value your business, $9,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price, and it's still significantly lower than what it's worth to me. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:**  I'm  moving closer to Bob's offer but not too quickly, leaving some room for further negotiation.  
* **Focusing on fairness:**  I'm framing my offer as a ""fair price"" and ""meeting in the middle,"" making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Maintaining leverage:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price, giving me flexibility to negotiate further or accept John's offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $11000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10500, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not close enough:** While $10,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still $4,500 less than what John is offering.  
* **Risk of going lower:**  Further negotiation might lead to a lower price, potentially putting me at a significant loss compared to John's offer.
* **Securing a guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a substantial profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation that could lead to a lower price."
