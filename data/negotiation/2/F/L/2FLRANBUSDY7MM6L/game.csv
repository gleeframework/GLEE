"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This would give us both a good deal and allow for a smooth transaction.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  While I'm aiming to secure a price closer to its true value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $1,075,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
