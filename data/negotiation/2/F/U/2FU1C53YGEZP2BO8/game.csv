"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can't afford $12,000 at this time. Would you consider lowering the price to $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,500 is a little too low for me. How about $10,500? This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
