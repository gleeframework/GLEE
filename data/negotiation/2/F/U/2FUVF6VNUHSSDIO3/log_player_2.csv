# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in something that will bring significant value to your business.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $13,000.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. While $13,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $11,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $13,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm counteroffering at $12,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the value the product brings to your business. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's not worth continuing the negotiation with Alice.  She's unlikely to go below $12,500, and you can get the product for $12,000 from John.  Time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed deal."
