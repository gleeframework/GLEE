"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives us room to negotiate and allows me to assess if he's a serious buyer.  I'll see if he's willing to even entertain this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can bridge the gap. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I want to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,400,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a decent profit. I'm confident this price will still be attractive to Bob, considering his initial offer."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still not ready to settle for $1,100,000. I'm going to counteroffer again, trying to find a middle ground. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I want to see if I can still get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price again to $1,300,000. This shows flexibility and signals my willingness to compromise. At this point, I'm getting closer to Bob's valuation. It's time to see if we can strike a deal."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,050,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not ready to sell. I believe there's still room for negotiation and I'm willing to give Bob one more counteroffer.  If he doesn't budge, I'll be ready to sell to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm coming down to $1,250,000, which is close to my minimum acceptable price and gives Bob a good deal considering his initial offer. If he rejects this, I'll be moving on to John."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's time to cut my losses and move on. Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price, and I've already made several concessions.  While I'd prefer to make a profit, I'm not willing to risk losing out on a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
