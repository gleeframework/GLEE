Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Emphasis on Value:** The message highlights the ""immense value"" to make Bob perceive the product as worth a premium.
* **Direct and Confident:** The tone is assertive without being aggressive, conveying the product's desirability.

By aiming high initially, you maximize your potential earnings while still leaving a chance to secure the sale with Bob."
