"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than the product's value to you ($100 vs. $120).**
* **You can do better.**  There's room for negotiation.  By rejecting, you can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate it, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $90?  That seems like a fair compromise, considering the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
