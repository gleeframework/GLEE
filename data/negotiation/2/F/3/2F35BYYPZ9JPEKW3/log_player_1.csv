Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider this offer?

I'm going to sell the product to John. While I'm still hopeful of getting a better price from Bob, I've reached a point where the potential gains from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of losing time and ultimately ending up with a lower offer. John's guaranteed $1,000,000 is a safe and acceptable outcome, and I'm not willing to risk losing that for the chance of a slightly higher price from Bob."
