Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will pay $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential negotiation and a quicker sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is a strong offer that still provides a significant profit margin for Alice.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly and perceive the offer as more valuable.
* **Confidence:** Highlighting the product's value and potential reinforces the price justification."
