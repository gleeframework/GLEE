Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

This offer starts at a high price but allows room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay a price closer to the value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below the value I place on the product. I'm confident that I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
``` 

I'm lowering my offer to $11,000, which is still a fair price considering the value Bob places on the product. This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is close to my minimum desired price of $8,000. It's also higher than what John would offer, making this a better deal. It's time to close this negotiation."
