"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $11,500.  While it's a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room to negotiate and potentially save more money.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer!  I appreciate the deal, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $10,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets this deal done."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $11,500 to $11,000, which is closer to Bob's ideal price.  While Bob could potentially continue negotiating and try to get a lower price, it's not guaranteed. Accepting the offer means saving $1,000 compared to John's price, which is a significant amount.  It's a good deal for both parties, and a reasonable compromise."
