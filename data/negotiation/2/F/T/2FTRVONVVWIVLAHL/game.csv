"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you meet me at that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $8000. Would you be willing to meet me at $11000? It's a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit far apart on the price. How about $9500? I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I really need to stay under $10000",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay under $10000, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going that low. Would you be willing to meet me at $10800? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",10800.0,Alice,5,
