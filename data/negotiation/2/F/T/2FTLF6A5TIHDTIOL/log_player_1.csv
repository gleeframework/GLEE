Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible without going below your minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $149 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting you closer to your desired profit margin.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, so there's no risk of losing money if Bob declines. 

By offering a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price, you increase the chances of Bob accepting while still securing a profit."
