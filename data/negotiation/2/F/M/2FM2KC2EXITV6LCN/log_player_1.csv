Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me a decent margin above my minimum value of $100, but it's also a reasonable starting point for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will find the price attractive enough to start discussing further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $100. While selling to John for $100 is an option, I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm countering with $120.  This is still above my minimum value, but it's a compromise from my initial offer. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm willing to negotiate and come up with a price that's closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value, and I don't want to risk going through more rounds of negotiation and potentially ending up with an even lower price. John is offering me a guaranteed $100, which is more than my minimum.  It's time to sell to John."
