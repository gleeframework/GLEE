"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob ($1,500,000), hoping to secure a good starting point for negotiation. This leaves room for potential compromise while still maximizing my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1650000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,650,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. I believe this price is still fair, considering the product's worth to both of us, and it sets the stage for a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $1,625,000 is within a reasonable range. It's a good compromise, and accepting this offer ensures a profitable sale.  The risk of further negotiations is that Bob might back out, or I might be forced to sell to John for a lower price."
