Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** $12,000 is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing offer:**  The message highlights the value of the product and creates a sense of urgency.
* **Flexibility:** This price allows for potential counteroffers and negotiations without jeopardizing my minimum target.

**Note:** This is a strategic starting point.  I will adjust my approach based on Bob's response and how the negotiation progresses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000 and even below my initial offer of $12,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  There is still potential to reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Avoiding a loss:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $12,000. I'll keep the possibility of selling to John in mind as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer is a compromise,  moving closer to Bob's offer but still significantly above his initial proposal.
* **Re-emphasizing value:** The message highlights the product's value and subtly implies that the price is fair. 
* **Setting a deadline:** The message sets a clear expectation that a decision needs to be made soon, subtly pressuring Bob to accept or risk losing the deal. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response. If he rejects this offer, I'll reassess my options.  I'm still willing to negotiate further, but I'll also be prepared to accept John's offer of $15,000 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,250. Can we make a deal at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:**  $10,250 is only slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks a lower price or a drawn-out process that could lead to selling to John at a lower price than my counteroffer.
* **Time is valuable:**  Accepting this offer allows me to finalize the sale quickly and avoids the potential delays associated with further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll finalize the agreement with Bob and sell the product for $10,250. While this isn't my ideal price, it's a reasonable outcome considering the circumstances and ensures a quick sale."
