Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response.  While I understand your offer, $5,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't let this go for less than its worth to me.  My final offer is $9,000.  This is a great deal for you.

While Alice's final offer of $9,000 is tempting, it's still higher than John's offer of $8,000.  There's no guarantee Alice will go any lower, so it makes the most financial sense to buy from John at this point."
