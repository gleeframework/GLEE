"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is within your budget, it's still significantly higher than what the product is worth to Alice.  There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $100, which is still a good deal for me as it's within my budget. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, and it leaves room for further negotiation if needed. I'm hoping Alice will accept this offer, but if not, I'm prepared to continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is a good price for me.  It's still below what I'm willing to pay, and getting closer to what the product is worth to Alice.  Continuing to negotiate risks the deal falling apart, and I'm not sure I'll be able to get a better price. Accepting this offer guarantees I get the product and save money compared to buying from John."
