```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I've already discounted the price from $150 to $120, and now you're asking for $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $110?

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
