"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for the best possible price.  Since I don't know Bob's value, I'm going to push for a significant profit.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer in the next round based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $650,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, as I believe I can still get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is still a significant profit for me and a price that I believe Bob may be willing to accept.  It's a compromise from my initial offer, but still well above his current offer.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still do better.  I'm going to keep negotiating and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $850,000. This is a more significant compromise than my last offer, bringing me closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful Bob will accept. If not, I might consider selling to John in the next round if the negotiation doesn't show significant progress."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $720,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $720,000 is getting close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm running out of rounds, but I'm going to see if I can push for a higher price in the next round. If we don't reach an agreement, I'll likely have to sell to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 780000}
```

I'm going to counter with $780,000. This is a significant compromise, but I believe it's the best I can do at this point. I'm nearing my minimum acceptable price, and I'm running out of rounds. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have no choice but to sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $760,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $760,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. We're down to the wire, and I don't have much room to negotiate. Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm risking a complete deal collapse. Selling to John guarantees me a fair price and avoids further negotiation."
