Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I recognize the value of your product, I believe your initial price is a little high for me.  I'd be willing to purchase the product for $650,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're tough!  I do appreciate you working with me. I'm willing to stretch my budget and offer you $775,000.  It's a significant investment for me, and I believe it's more than fair considering John is offering the same product for $800,000.   Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is revealing he knows about John's offer and is trying to use it as leverage. It's clear Bob is unwilling to meet Alice's valuation and is unlikely to significantly increase his offer in the remaining rounds.  Selling to John for the full $1,200,000 is the best move to maximize profit."
