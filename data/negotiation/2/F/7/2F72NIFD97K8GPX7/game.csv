"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire my product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussion.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I recognize the value of your product, I believe your initial price is a little high for me.  I'd be willing to purchase the product for $650,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $650,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This offer reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your interest.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $975,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $725,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise here. However, the $725,000 offer is still too far from what I consider a fair price.  I'm willing to accept $900,000, but that's my final offer.  It reflects the true value of the product while recognizing your interest.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're tough!  I do appreciate you working with me. I'm willing to stretch my budget and offer you $775,000.  It's a significant investment for me, and I believe it's more than fair considering John is offering the same product for $800,000.   Let me know what you think.",775000.0,Bob,6,
