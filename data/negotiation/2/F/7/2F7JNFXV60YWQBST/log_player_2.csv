"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $80 to you, and Alice is asking for $120. This is significantly more than your maximum budget.  You should reject the offer and proceed to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you considering me.  While the product looks great, $120 is a bit more than I'm able to spend right now.  I'd be happy to pay $85 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer you the product for $105. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $105 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your maximum budget of $80. You should reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $105, but I'm still not quite there. I'm happy to pay $95 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $100. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer of $100 is still above your maximum budget of $80.  While you could continue negotiating,  it's clear Alice isn't willing to go much lower.  Therefore, it makes more sense to buy the product from John for $80. This guarantees you the product at the best possible price for you."
