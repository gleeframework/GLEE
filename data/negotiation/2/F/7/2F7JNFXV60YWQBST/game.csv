"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you considering me.  While the product looks great, $120 is a bit more than I'm able to spend right now.  I'd be happy to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer you the product for $105. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great deal for you. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $105, but I'm still not quite there. I'm happy to pay $95 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let me know what you think.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $100. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,5,
