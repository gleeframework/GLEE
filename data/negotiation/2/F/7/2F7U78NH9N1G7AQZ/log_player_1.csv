"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:**  My message highlights the product's worth to Bob, making it seem like a good deal.
* **Open to Discussion:** The message ends with a question, inviting Bob to engage in conversation and potentially counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer aims to gauge Bob's interest and set a high starting point for the negotiation. By leaving room for negotiation, I'm hoping to secure a price closer to my desired value while still remaining attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe we can come to a better agreement. How about we aim for $9,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's counteroffer is $9,000, which is still below my desired value of $15,000 and significantly lower than my initial offer.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my value.  
* **Avoid Immediate Loss:** Accepting his offer now would result in a substantial loss.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue the negotiation, potentially pushing him closer to my desired price. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to try and secure a better deal. Selling to John right now would be a missed opportunity to potentially get a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and meet at $10,500? This price still gives you a significant discount and provides me a fair return."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This signals my willingness to negotiate while maintaining a price closer to my desired value.
* **Appeal to Reason:** My message emphasizes the benefit for Bob, highlighting the discount he would receive, while also emphasizing the fairness of the price for me.
* **Maintain Pressure:** The message implicitly suggests that I'm open to further negotiation, but that I'm firm on my price.

**Strategy:**

By making a counteroffer, I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but not give in easily. This strategy aims to push Bob closer to my desired price while keeping the negotiation alive. I'm also aiming to create a sense of urgency by implying that I'm willing to walk away if a fair price is not reached."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position and I respect it. I would like to counter with an offer of $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns closer with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is significantly closer to my desired value of $15,000.  
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While it's not my ideal price, I could potentially negotiate further in the next round.
* **Risk of John:** Selling to John for $15,000 seems tempting, but there's a risk that Bob will not counteroffer further, leaving me with a lower price than I could potentially achieve.

**Strategy:**

It's a strategic decision to accept Bob's offer at this point.  By accepting, I secure a profit, and I can then use the next rounds to potentially negotiate for a higher price if Bob is still willing to engage. There's a chance I could get a better price from Bob, but also a chance I might lose him and have to sell to John at a lower price. It's a calculated risk with potential for a higher return."
