"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a good starting point, but I'm really hoping to stay closer to my budget of $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider $8,500?  It's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is unfortunately still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,500, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $8,000. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could close the deal quickly.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of the product. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $9,250 is the lowest I can go.  Let's close this deal.",9250.0,Alice,5,
