"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not quite ready to let it go for $8000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my original offer. How about we meet at $9500? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $9800? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",9800.0,Alice,5,
