"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $900,000. I think this is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a concession to get this deal done, but I'm still confident that this price is a fair reflection of the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Alice's offer is less than your maximum budget, you know John will sell you the product for $1,000,000.  There's a chance Alice might reduce her price further, making a rejection the best strategic move."
