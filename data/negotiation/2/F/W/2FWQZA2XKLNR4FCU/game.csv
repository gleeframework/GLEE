"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $105 is lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $110? That's still a great price for this product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $108 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to get. How about we split the difference and go with $109? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",109.0,Alice,5,
