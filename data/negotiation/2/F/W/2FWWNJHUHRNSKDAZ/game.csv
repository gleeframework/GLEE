"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $1200000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1100000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1100000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1050000. This is a fair compromise that's closer to both of our positions. Let's see if we can make this work.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer you the product for $1080000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it a fair compromise.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
