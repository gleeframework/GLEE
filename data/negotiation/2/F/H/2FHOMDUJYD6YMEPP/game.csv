"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $950,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal. Let me know what you think!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,050,000 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product, which is my absolute maximum. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away happy.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm afraid $1,000,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great value for both of us. Let me know what you think!",1025000.0,Alice,5,
