"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this. While the price is attractive, I'm aiming to stay within my budget. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This would still be a good deal for you as you value it at $1,200,000. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. After considering your offer, I am willing to negotiate further. I am now offering the product to you for $975,000. This price reflects a compromise between our original offer and your counteroffer, while still providing a reasonable profit for us. I look forward to your consideration of this revised offer.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate further. However, $975,000 is still a bit higher than I'm able to go at this time. I'm prepared to offer $925,000 for the product. This would still leave you with a substantial profit and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal.",925000.0,Bob,4,
