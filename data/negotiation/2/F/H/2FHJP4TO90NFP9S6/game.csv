"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to buy this product from you. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking to make a good profit on this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to go up to $11,000, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $11,250. That's the lowest price I'm willing to accept.",11250.0,Alice,5,
