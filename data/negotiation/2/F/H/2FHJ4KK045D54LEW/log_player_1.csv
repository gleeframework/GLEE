Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming higher with Bob could yield a better profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $1,350,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still offers a substantial discount from John's offer. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's high value without explicitly revealing John's offer, encouraging Bob to consider the deal seriously.

**Outcome Possibilities:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  I make a profit of $550,000 (significantly more than selling to John).
* **Bob Rejects:** I sell to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000.

This approach prioritizes maximizing potential profit while maintaining a fallback option."
