"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me. ",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $8,500 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great value.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still stuck at my budget limit though.  If you're truly serious about selling, I'm willing to offer $8,800. This is a good price for both of us, as it's a fair compromise between our positions. ",8800.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,200. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great value for you.",9200.0,Alice,5,
