Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $18,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum threshold of $15,000 and leaves room for potential negotiation. I believe Bob will be interested, as he values the product at $15,000, but I'm hoping to capitalize on his potential desire to acquire it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, $12,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}
```

I'm offering $16,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  It still allows me to make a profit, but it also shows flexibility and a willingness to work with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. It's not worth risking further negotiation, especially since John is offering my minimum price right now. I'll take the guaranteed $15,000 from John and avoid any more potential haggling."
