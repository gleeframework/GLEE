"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, and I'm open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, that price point is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential and capabilities. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, that price is still too high for me. To be frank, I'm willing to go as high as $950,000, but I need to see some movement from you to justify that. ",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty and willingness to move on the price. To bridge the gap, I'm prepared to make a significant move. I'm willing to let go of the product for $1,650,000. This is a substantial reduction on my end and reflects my strong desire to close this deal with you.  Let's get this done!",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but that's still too high for me.  I can do $1,050,000 as my final offer.  If that doesn't work, I'll have to go with a different vendor.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
