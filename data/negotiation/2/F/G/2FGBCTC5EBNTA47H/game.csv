"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit too low for me right now.  I'm willing to come down to $105. That's still a great deal for a product of this quality. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $97.50. Can we do that?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to be fair, and I appreciate that. However, $97.50 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference again and go with $101.25? That's a reasonable compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",101.25,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $101.25 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",95.0,Bob,6,
