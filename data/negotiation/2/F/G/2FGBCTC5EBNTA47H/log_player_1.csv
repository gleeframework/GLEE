"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that you've shown interest in. I'm asking for $110 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a positive tone to build rapport with Bob.
* **Value proposition:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of his interest in the product, making him more likely to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.**  While I want to close the deal, selling for less than $100 would be a loss for me.
* **I have more rounds to negotiate.**  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation.
* **John is a backup option.** If I can't reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob, I can always sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a bit too low for me right now.  I'm willing to come down to $105. That's still a great deal for a product of this quality. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not at the expense of my own profitability.
* **Emphasizing value:**  I'm again reminding Bob of the product's quality to justify my price.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm leaving the door open for further discussion and potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $97.50. Can we do that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Room for negotiation:**  There are still 6 rounds left, and I believe I can still improve the price by continuing to negotiate. 
* **John is a safe option:**  Selling to John for $100 is always a possibility if I don't get a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to be fair, and I appreciate that. However, $97.50 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference again and go with $101.25? That's a reasonable compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 101.25} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm proposing a middle ground again, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:** I'm subtly emphasizing the value of the product by suggesting that $101.25 is a reasonable compromise.
* **Focus on closing the deal:** I'm reiterating my desire to reach an agreement with Bob while still maintaining a price close to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $101.25 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  We're halfway through the rounds, and Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Low potential for improvement:** I doubt I can convince Bob to go higher than $95, given his insistence that it's his final offer.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:**  Selling to John for $100 ensures a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations that might lead to a lower price or a failed deal. 

Given the circumstances, it's more prudent to take the guaranteed $100 from John and move on."
