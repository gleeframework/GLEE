"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the significant return on investment you can expect.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to offer $600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price still reflects the true value of the product and the benefits it will bring to your business.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to increase my offer to $700,000.  Let me know if that's something you can work with.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer. To show I'm serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to drop to $850,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise.",850000.0,Alice,5,
