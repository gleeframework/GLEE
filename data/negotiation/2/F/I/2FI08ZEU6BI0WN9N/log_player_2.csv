"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are looking to save as much money as possible.  Since Alice's offer is at your maximum price point, and John is also willing to sell for the same price, there is no benefit to negotiating with Alice.  Buying from John ensures the transaction happens without any risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffers."
