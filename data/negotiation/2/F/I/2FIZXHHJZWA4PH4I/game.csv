"I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1400000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I can offer you a compromise of $1600000. This is the lowest price I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I can see you're serious about this product, so I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $1500000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
