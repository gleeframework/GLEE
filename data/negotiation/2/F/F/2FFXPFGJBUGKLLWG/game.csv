"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a little too low for me. Could you do $17,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a great value at that price.",17000.0,Alice,3,
