It's clear that Bob is very unlikely to meet your minimum acceptable price.  He's steadily increasing his offers, but at this rate, you'll likely only get a small amount more than John's offer. It's not worth risking the deal entirely by continuing to negotiate.  Selling to John guarantees your minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation rounds."
