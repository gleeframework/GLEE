Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since I know Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and I have a guaranteed sale at that price, I want to start significantly higher to explore maximum profit potential.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer of $2,250,000 provides  room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  It shows I'm willing to discuss but also value the product highly.
* **Confidence and Value Emphasis:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and my belief that it's worth the asking price. This can make Bob more receptive to a higher number.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiating Style:** I don't have information about Bob's negotiation tactics. If he's known to be very price-sensitive, I might adjust my strategy in future interactions. 
* **Relationship Building:**  While my immediate goal is profit, building a good relationship with Bob could be beneficial for future business opportunities. I've tried to strike a balance between firmness and courtesy in my message."
