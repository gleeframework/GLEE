This offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $1,500,000 but leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to secure a price closer to my minimum while still providing Bob with a good deal."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to pay that much. I'm thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While $950,000 is a good offer, it's still too far away from my minimum price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."

Bob's offer of $980,000 is still too far below my minimum price of $1,500,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, it's clear that we're too far apart in our desired price.  To avoid further delays and ensure I get the best possible value, I'll sell to John for $1,500,000."
