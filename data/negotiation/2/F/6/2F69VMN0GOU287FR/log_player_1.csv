"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $120, which is significantly above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly Approach:**  I'm being friendly and positive to encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm asking for his opinion to show I'm open to discussion. 

This strategy balances the need to maximize profit with the risk of losing the deal if I start too high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I can only pay up to $100 for it. Would you consider accepting this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$100 is too low:**  While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than my desired price point. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to give Bob another chance to come closer to my asking price. 
* **Avoid Selling to John:** Selling to John right now would only yield $80, which is my minimum. I'm hoping for a better outcome with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. That's still a good deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him,  reinforcing the value of the deal. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. I hope this meets in the middle for us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price point ($80).
* **Room for Compromise:** I believe there's still room for further negotiation. I'm not desperate to sell, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to try and get closer to my desired profit.
* **Avoiding John:** Selling to John for $80 would be a last resort. I'm confident I can get a better deal with Bob, even if it takes a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm again proposing a price that's a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Fairness Emphasis:** I'm framing the offer as ""fair"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity and encourage him to meet me halfway.
* **Urgency but not desperation:** I mention finding a solution that ""works for both of us"" to subtly imply a sense of urgency while avoiding desperation.

This counteroffer aims to close the gap while maintaining a respectable profit margin, keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. I hope this meets your expectations and we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Target:**  While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price ($80).
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** I believe that Bob is willing to go a little higher, given his previous offers. 
* **Avoiding John:** I'm not desperate to sell at this point and don't want to settle for John's lower offer. 

I'm willing to take the risk of another round to try to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $100, but I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price to make this deal worthwhile for me. Would you consider $102?  It's just a small step up, and it would allow us to close this deal without either of us feeling like we've given up too much. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 102}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:**  I'm only asking for a $2 increase, making it a relatively minor adjustment for Bob.
* **Focus on Closing:**  I'm emphasizing the desire to ""close the deal"" to encourage Bob to agree.
* **Mutual Benefit:** I'm framing the $102 offer as a ""small step up"" that benefits both of us, implying a win-win scenario.

This strategy aims to bridge the gap without making a significant concession, while simultaneously increasing the pressure for a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm willing to pay $98 for the product. I hope this meets your expectations and we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is slightly higher, it's still below my minimum acceptable price ($80).
* **Risk vs Reward:** There are only two rounds left.  I'm willing to take the risk of rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer in the hopes of getting a better deal.
* **Pressure for a Deal:** By refusing his offer and making a counteroffer, I'm putting pressure on Bob to reach a deal before the time runs out. 

If I don't get a better offer, I'll likely accept John's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to come down to $99 for the product. This is a great price for you, and it's the best I can do at this point.  Let's close this deal before time runs out."", ""product_price"": 99}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:** I'm making a final concession by dropping my price to $99, which is just $1 above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Urgency:** I'm highlighting the limited time remaining to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Best Possible Price:** I'm emphasizing that this is the ""best I can do"" to convince Bob that further negotiation is unlikely.

If Bob rejects this offer, I will be forced to accept John's offer in the final round, so this counteroffer is a last attempt to secure a more favorable deal."
