"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,500. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $11,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it brings to me.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $13,500 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,750. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",12750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $12,750 is closer, but I'm aiming for something below $12,000. Would you be willing to consider $11,500? That's a compromise I can get behind.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to get the price below $12,000, and I'm willing to meet you there. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $12,200. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",12200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. $12,200 is getting closer.  How about we settle at $11,800?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $11,800 is getting close to your target, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $12,100. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",12100.0,Alice,7,
