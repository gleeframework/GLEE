Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $13,500 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to get the price below $12,000, and I'm willing to meet you there. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $11,800 is getting close to your target, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $12,100. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower.  While we could push for a slightly better deal, accepting at $12,100 secures a significant savings compared to John's $15,000 price."
