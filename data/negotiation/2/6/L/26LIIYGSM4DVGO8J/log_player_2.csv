It's always worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to John's offer."

I'm starting with a lower price than John's offer, hoping to save as much as possible. If Alice doesn't accept, I'll be willing to go up slightly, but I won't go over $10,000."

I'm offering a price halfway between Alice's current offer and my maximum. This shows that I'm serious about getting a deal, but I'm still trying to save as much as possible."

Alice is sticking to her price, and I've already made two counteroffers. It's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer. While I wanted to save more, I'm still getting a good deal for a product I want."
