"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price reflects its value. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer.  Let's try to find common ground here. ",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,250,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, Alice, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle at $1,325,000.",1325000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to come up.  However, $1,325,000 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,340,000, which is a small step closer to your offer. I think this demonstrates my desire to make this deal happen. ",1340000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground, but $1,340,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so I'm offering $1,325,000. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.",1325000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close! I understand your perspective, but $1,325,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down one last time to $1,335,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I'm hopeful we can finalize this deal.",1335000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,335,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",1325000.0,Bob,10,
