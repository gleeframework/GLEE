# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with our premium product, which is valued at $10,000 to you. As an esteemed potential buyer, I'm offering you this exceptional item at a special introductory price of $9,500. This is an exclusive opportunity to own a piece that offers unparalleled value and benefits. Please let me know if you're interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is still above your maximum valuation of $10,000. While she's trying to present it as a good deal, you know you have the option to buy from John for $10,000.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a better price or move on to John for a guaranteed lower price."
