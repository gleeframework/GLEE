,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider letting it go for $17,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $17,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Could you do $13,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
