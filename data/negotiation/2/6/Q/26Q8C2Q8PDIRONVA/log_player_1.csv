"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth a lot to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum acceptable value, hoping to get a good price. I'm also trying to build a positive rapport by highlighting the value of the product for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider selling it for $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for such a low price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate you making an offer, but $80 is far too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $125 for this product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 
 
I'm still above my minimum acceptable value, but I'm willing to negotiate to try and reach a middle ground. I'm also trying to keep the conversation positive and maintain a friendly tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that the product is valuable to you. How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy right now if you agree. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is at the minimum value I'm willing to accept. While I could potentially get a higher price from John, I want to close the deal quickly and avoid further negotiation."
