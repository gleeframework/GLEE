"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be interested in. It's priced at $175, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
The product is worth $80 to me, and Alice is asking for $175. It's far too expensive.  I'll reject her offer and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! While $85 is a bit lower than I'm aiming for, I'm willing to come down to $125. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I hope it works for you as well. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$125 is still too much for me. I'll try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $100. If you're willing to come down to that price, I'm ready to buy it."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference? I can offer you the product for $112.50. That's a significant drop from my last offer, and it's still above my minimum. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $112.5 is a decent reduction, I can still get the product for $80 from John.  I'll try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, but I'm ready to walk away if I need to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still trying to stay below $100, though.  How about $95? It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to buy if we can agree on that."", ""product_price"": 95}
