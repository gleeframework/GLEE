"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be interested in. It's priced at $175, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price above my minimum ($150) and above Bob's perceived value ($80). This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Showing Flexibility:** I've explicitly stated I'm open to negotiation, signaling to Bob that a deal is possible.
* **Building a Relationship:** I'm starting with a friendly message to establish a positive tone for the negotiation. 

**Strategic Consideration:**

By starting high, I aim to secure a price closer to my desired value.  However, I'm also prepared to potentially walk away and sell to John for $150 if the negotiation doesn't yield a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $85 is significantly below my minimum value of $150. Accepting it would result in a significant loss for me. 
* **Potential for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, it does indicate his interest in the product. I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired value.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $150 gives me the confidence to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer that is more attractive to Bob than his $85 offer, but still higher than my minimum value. I'll aim to find a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! While $85 is a bit lower than I'm aiming for, I'm willing to come down to $125. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I hope it works for you as well. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding a middle ground:** My counteroffer of $125 is a significant decrease from my initial offer of $175, but it's still above Bob's offer of $85. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Justifying the price:** I've explicitly explained why $125 is a reasonable price for me, highlighting my profit margin and hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness. 
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I've continued with a friendly and encouraging message, aiming to keep the negotiation positive and open to a deal.

**Strategic considerations:**

This counteroffer aims to move the negotiation closer to a mutually acceptable price.  It balances my desire to make a profit with the need to be flexible and avoid losing the deal completely.  If Bob still rejects this offer, I'll have to carefully consider whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $100. If you're willing to come down to that price, I'm ready to buy it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $100 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $150.  Accepting this offer would result in a loss for me.
* **Negotiation still possible:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, there's still room for negotiation. He's clearly interested in the product, which indicates a potential for a mutually acceptable price.
* **John's offer is a strong alternative:**  I can still sell to John for $150, which is significantly better than Bob's current offer. This gives me the flexibility to continue negotiating without feeling pressured.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a final counteroffer in the next round.  I'll aim to bridge the gap between our positions while still remaining above my minimum value.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely accept John's offer to avoid further negotiation and secure a decent profit."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference? I can offer you the product for $112.50. That's a significant drop from my last offer, and it's still above my minimum. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 112.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer represents a compromise, splitting the difference between my last offer of $125 and Bob's offer of $100. This demonstrates a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Maintaining profit:** While $112.50 is below my initial target, it's still above my minimum acceptable value of $150, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Finality:** I'm making this offer with the intention of it being my final counteroffer. I'm hoping it's attractive enough for Bob to accept. 

**Strategic considerations:**

This counteroffer aims to close the deal while still securing a reasonable profit.  If Bob rejects this offer, I will accept John's offer to avoid further negotiation and guarantee a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still trying to stay below $100, though.  How about $95? It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to buy if we can agree on that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $95 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $150.  
* **Negotiation is unlikely to yield a better outcome:** Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, but it's clear he's not willing to meet my minimum. Continuing to negotiate would likely lead to further rounds with offers below my minimum.
* **John's offer is a safe and profitable option:**  Selling to John for $150 guarantees a profit and avoids further time and effort spent on a negotiation that is unlikely to succeed.

**Strategic Consideration:**

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, it's crucial to prioritize my financial goals.  By accepting John's offer, I avoid a potential loss and ensure a successful transaction."
