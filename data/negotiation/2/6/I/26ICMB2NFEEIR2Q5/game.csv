"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $80. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $120 is a tempting offer, it's a bit too low for me to consider. How about we split the difference and go with $160?  I believe this price still gives you a great deal while ensuring I can sell it fairly.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand your position, Alice. Let's try $140. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects the value of the product while keeping my budget in mind.",140.0,Bob,4,
