"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm offering $10,500. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me.  How about $11,500? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I believe this is a fair price for both of us. If we can't agree, I'll unfortunately have to move on to another buyer.",11500.0,Alice,5,
