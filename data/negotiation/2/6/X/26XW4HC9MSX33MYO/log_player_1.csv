"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still being above my minimum acceptable price of $100.  Since Bob values the product at $100, he might be willing to negotiate a bit.  We'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price.  There are still 8 rounds left, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm counteroffering at $105. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer of $90 and my previous offer of $120. It's still above my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also showing that I value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $95 isn't my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I've already rejected a couple of offers, and we're down to Round 4.  There's a risk that Bob will continue to lower his offer, and with John as a backup, I'm not willing to risk going too much lower.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $95."
