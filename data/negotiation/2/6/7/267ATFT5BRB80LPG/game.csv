"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I agree this product has a lot of potential. However,  $950,000 is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and your initial offer.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $800,000 is still a bit above your target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you at $825,000, which is the lowest price I'm comfortable with. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and the effort we've put into negotiating.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise here. $825,000 is very close to what I had in mind. Would you be willing to settle at $810,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",810000.0,Bob,6,
