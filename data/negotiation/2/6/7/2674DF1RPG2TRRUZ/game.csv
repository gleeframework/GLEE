"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is great, $15,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $15,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $13,500. It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, but also shows I'm willing to negotiate.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the counter offer.  I appreciate you coming down, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could we settle on $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $13,500 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $12,800. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value.",12800.0,Alice,5,
