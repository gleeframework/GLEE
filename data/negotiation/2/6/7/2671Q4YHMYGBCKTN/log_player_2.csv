"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product, which I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000, which I think is a great deal considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell and is starting high. You can likely get a better price by rejecting this initial offer."
