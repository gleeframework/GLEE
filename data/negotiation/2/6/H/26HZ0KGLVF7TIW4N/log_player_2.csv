"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your target price of $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation, and you should try to get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer with $1,075,000. This price still reflects the value I have in the product, but it's a bit more in line with your offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer, but $1,075,000 is still above your target price.  You're close to your goal and you should continue to try and get the price lower.  It's likely Alice is willing to negotiate further as she's already lowered her price once."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,025,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to be flexible. However, I don't want to go too low. I'll counteroffer with $1,050,000 again, but this time I'll throw in a small concession: I'll also include a warranty and maintenance package worth $25,000. This way, you'll get a better deal overall. The new price is $1,050,000, and I'll add the warranty and maintenance package to sweeten the deal.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,050,000 which is right at your target.  While you might be able to negotiate further, the added warranty and maintenance package make this a good deal.  It's likely Alice won't go lower than $1,050,000, and John's price is $1,000,000. This offer gives you a better price with additional benefits."
