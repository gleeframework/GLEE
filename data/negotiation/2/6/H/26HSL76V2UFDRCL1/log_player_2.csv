"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer.  While it's a good price, he can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  He has 10 rounds and a backup option with John, so there's no need to rush."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, I'm looking to spend closer to $11,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer. While $12,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob is still aiming for a lower price.  He can likely get closer to his target of $11,000 by continuing to negotiate, especially since he has 7 rounds remaining and a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my goal of $11,500.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $11,500 simply won't work for me. I'm sticking to my last offer of $12,000. This product is worth significantly more than that, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know your final decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should accept the offer. He's gotten Alice down to $12,000, which is closer to his target price of $11,000 than John's price of $15,000.  While he could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to negotiate, or he could run out of rounds.  At this point, accepting the offer is the most logical choice to ensure a good deal."
