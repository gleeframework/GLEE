"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, I'm looking to spend closer to $11,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $11,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my goal of $11,500.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $11,500 simply won't work for me. I'm sticking to my last offer of $12,000. This product is worth significantly more than that, and I'm sure you'll agree it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know your final decision.",12000.0,Alice,5,
