"Bob, I understand your offer, but $950000 is a bit too low for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This price is still a good deal for you, as you value the product at $1000000, and it gives me a more reasonable return on my investment. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
