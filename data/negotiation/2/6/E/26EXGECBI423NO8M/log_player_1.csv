Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value and features, I'm initially proposing a price of $12,000.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""unique value and features,"" Alice subtly justifies the high price without revealing her true valuation.
* **Gauging Interest:** Offering a chance to buy before a public listing can create a sense of exclusivity and urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""What are your thoughts?"" keeps the conversation open for Bob to counter-offer, beginning a negotiation process.

**Important Note:** While Alice has a guaranteed sale at $10,000, it's strategically smarter to aim higher with Bob.  This strategy maximizes her potential profit."
