Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  This is a great price considering its value to you.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly above your minimum price:**  This shows you're willing to negotiate but still value the product highly.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob incentive to negotiate and potentially accept your offer. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You have some flexibility to lower the price if Bob counters with a lower offer. 

Remember, you can always walk away and sell to John for $800,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price that gives you a substantial profit and allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to you. It's worth trying to negotiate further to get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is a good starting point, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges your budget while still providing me with a reasonable profit. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This price is fair for both of us.  It allows me to stay within my budget and gives you a good profit.  Let's settle on this and close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than John's offer, and it's getting closer to your desired price.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's always a risk that Bob will walk away, leaving you with only John's offer.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a good profit and finalizes the deal."
