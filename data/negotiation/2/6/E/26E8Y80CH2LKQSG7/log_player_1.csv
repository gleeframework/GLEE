{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product for $110. It's a real steal!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$110 offer:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $100. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed. 
* **Positive message:** I'm trying to create a positive atmosphere and make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Negotiation room:** I'm leaving room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters.  If he rejects this offer, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts the offer, I've successfully sold the product.
* If Bob rejects the offer, I'll wait for his counteroffer.
* If Bob doesn't counter within a reasonable timeframe, or if his counteroffer is too low, I'll move on and sell the product to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85 right now. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $85 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $100.  While I'm happy to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell the product at such a low price.  I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $85 is a bit too low for me right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $95? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $95, which is halfway between my initial offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $85. 
* **Positive message:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and emphasizing that I'm trying to find a fair price for both of us.
* **Negotiation room:** I'm still leaving some room to negotiate downwards if needed. However, I'm not willing to go lower than $95.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts this offer, I've successfully sold the product.
* If Bob rejects the offer, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer.
* If Bob doesn't counter within a reasonable timeframe, or if his counteroffer is too low, I'll move on and sell the product to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90, which is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $90 is very close to my minimum acceptable value of $100.  While I would prefer to get closer to $100, it's better to secure a sale than to risk losing the deal altogether.  At this point, it's not worth risking a counteroffer and potentially driving Bob away, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John for $100.  It's better to accept the $90 and move on."
