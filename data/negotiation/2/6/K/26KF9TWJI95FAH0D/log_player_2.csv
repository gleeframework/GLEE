"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $120, which is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is less than your maximum budget, you can likely get a better price. Alice is clearly trying to get a profit margin, and you have the option to buy from John for $150. By rejecting this offer, you might encourage Alice to propose a lower price or you can always resort to buying from John."
