"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$12,000 is still too high for Bob.  He can do better by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for as close to his maximum value of $15,000 as possible. A counteroffer of $9,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and could be enticing for her, especially considering her own valuation of $8,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is closer to Bob's desired price, he can still try to negotiate further.  There is still room for Alice to lower her price and for Bob to potentially get a better deal.  He's better off trying one more counteroffer before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to the middle ground between his target price and Alice's offer.  $10,500 represents a further compromise while still leaving some room for Alice to make a small profit.  This counteroffer aims to incentivize Alice to accept and close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's significantly closer to his maximum value of $15,000. Considering that they are halfway through the negotiation rounds, and there's a risk Alice might not accept further counteroffers, it's wiser for Bob to accept the current offer and secure the product.  He's getting a good deal, and further negotiation might not yield a better outcome within the remaining rounds."
