"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 might be a stretch, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering its value to you and my initial offer.",875000.0,Alice,3,
