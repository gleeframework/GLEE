Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer the product to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to the table.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. This is my final offer for now, let's see if we can make it work.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $12,000.  Alice is getting closer to Bob's target price, but it's still above his limit. Since he has the option to buy from John for a price that fits his budget, it's the most sensible decision in this round."
