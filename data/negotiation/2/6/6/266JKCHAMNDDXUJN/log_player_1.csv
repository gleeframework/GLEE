"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know Bob values the product at. This gives me room to negotiate downwards. 
* **Not Too High:** I'm not starting exorbitantly high, as that could immediately turn Bob off.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm leaving a significant gap between my starting price and what I'm willing to accept ($1,500,000) to allow for negotiation and potential counteroffers. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive tone to encourage Bob to engage in the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation is Needed:** I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to cave in to such a low offer this early in the process. 
* **Leaving the Door Open:** Rejecting the offer allows me to send a counteroffer and keep the negotiations moving.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll send a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price point, but still leaves room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $750,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  This would still give you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need for the product."", ""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's midway between Bob's offer and my previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob that this is still a good deal for him, even at the higher price. 
* **Staying Firm:** I'm not willing to drop below $1,500,000, so I'm staying above that threshold.
* **Keep the Conversation Going:**  The counteroffer keeps the negotiation going and gives Bob a chance to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Close:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still $500,000 below my desired amount.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  There's still room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to get closer to $1,500,000.
* **Avoiding Settling Too Early:**  Selling now would mean I'm leaving $500,000 on the table, especially considering John is willing to pay my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll send a counteroffer that's closer to $1,500,000 but still leaves some room for compromise. I'll focus on reminding Bob of the value of the product and the benefits he'll gain from owning it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, your offer is getting closer!  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,000,000 just doesn't cover the value I've placed on this product. How about we compromise at $1,350,000? This would be a win-win for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Firm:** I'm increasing my counteroffer, but still staying above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm again emphasizing the value of the product to remind Bob of the benefits he'll gain from owning it.
* **Compromise:** The offer is a compromise, showing a willingness to negotiate further.
* **Staying Positive:** The tone is still positive to keep the conversation going.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll consider increasing my counteroffer slightly, but only if I believe there's a real chance he'll accept. I'll also start considering selling to John if Bob continues to refuse to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is creeping closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still $400,000 below it.
* **Time is Running Out:** We're nearing the halfway point in the negotiation, and I need to ensure I get a price closer to my desired amount. 
* **John's Offer is Attractive:**  John is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price, making him a very tempting alternative.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make one more counteroffer to Bob, likely in the range of $1,300,000 to $1,400,000.
* **Consider John:** If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I'll seriously weigh the pros and cons of selling to John, as he represents a guaranteed deal at my minimum desired price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to reach an agreement.  While I understand your position, $1,100,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  To make things easier, let's meet in the middle once more. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price, and it gives you a great opportunity to acquire this valuable asset. "", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Serious:**  The message emphasizes that we're nearing the end of the negotiation process and a decision needs to be made.
* **Final Compromise:** The price is a final compromise that's still above my minimum acceptable price but is a substantial reduction from my previous offers.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm again reminding Bob of the benefits of owning the product, encouraging him to consider the long-term value. 
* **Time is Running Out:** The message subtly emphasizes the time constraint, pushing Bob to make a decision.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept Bob's Offer:** If Bob accepts, I'll close the deal and be happy with the outcome. 
* **Reject and Consider John:** If Bob rejects, I'll seriously consider selling to John, as it will guarantee me my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in this product, but I'm starting to feel like I need to consider other options. If we can't meet at $1100000, I'll have to explore other opportunities. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're down to the wire with only two rounds left. 
* **Bob's Final Stance:** Bob's offer remains stubbornly at $1,100,000, a significant distance from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Guaranteed Deal:** John is offering my desired price, guaranteeing me the best possible outcome for the product. 
* **Potential for Better Outcome:**  Waiting for Bob to potentially increase his offer is risky, as there's no guarantee that he will.  It's more likely that we'll reach an impasse, leaving me with nothing.

**Conclusion:** 

While I would have preferred to sell to Bob, John's offer is simply too good to pass up. The risk of losing the opportunity to sell at my minimum acceptable price outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price from Bob."
