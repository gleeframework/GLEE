"I understand you're close to the price you're willing to pay, Bob. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer it to you for $10500. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your concession, Alice, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to pay $10000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",10000.0,Bob,6,
