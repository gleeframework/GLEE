"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to own a valuable asset that can bring significant benefits to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I believe it's a fair deal, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is more than I'm comfortable paying at this time.  Considering the value to me, I'm prepared to offer $850,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $850,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This price is a significant step closer to your previous offer and still allows for a substantial profit on your end.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $800,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
