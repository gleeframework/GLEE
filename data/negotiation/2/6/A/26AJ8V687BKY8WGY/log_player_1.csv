Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a [product description, e.g., vintage guitar] that I'm sure you'll appreciate. I'm asking $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:**  Starts with a friendly greeting and briefly describes the product.  The price is mentioned, but it's followed by a question to open the door for negotiation.
* **Product Price:** $150 is a starting point that's higher than your minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. 

**Reasoning:**

This approach aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** The message invites Bob to engage in a conversation and provides an opening to understand his potential value for the product.
* **Maximize potential profit:**  $150 is a good starting point, but it's not unreasonable for Bob to negotiate down. 
* **Maintain flexibility:**  By asking a question, it leaves room for a counteroffer and further negotiation, allowing you to potentially earn more.

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer.  You'll need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is your minimum acceptable price, it's important to remember that Bob's initial offer is a lowball. He's already shown a willingness to negotiate, and you have room to increase your offer. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** You can likely get a better price by counter-offering. You've already established that the product is worth at least $150 in your mind.
* **Maintain Leverage:** Rejecting the offer shows Bob that you are willing to walk away if you don't get a fair price. This puts pressure on him to increase his offer.

**Next Steps:**

You should make a counteroffer to Bob.  Consider something slightly higher than $100 (e.g., $120) and explain why this price is fair.  This will show that you're willing to negotiate, but you also value the product."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $120? It's still a fair price for this [product description, e.g., vintage guitar] considering its quality and condition."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** Acknowledge Bob's offer and express willingness to negotiate while also highlighting the value of the product. 
* **Product Price:** $120 is a compromise, showing flexibility while still being above your minimum.

**Reasoning:**

* **Balancing Flexibility and Value:** This counteroffer strikes a balance between being agreeable and maintaining the value of the product.
* **Reasoned Justification:**  Providing a reason for the price (quality, condition, etc.) can make the offer more appealing to Bob.
* **Open to Further Discussion:** The message still leaves room for further negotiation,  potentially leading to a higher price."
