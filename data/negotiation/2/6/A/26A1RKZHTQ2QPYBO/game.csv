"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a product that is worth $1,000,000 to you.  I understand its value to you, and I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,050,000.  This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair profit margin for me.  Consider this offer carefully.  If you decline, I have another buyer lined up, but I believe this product is a perfect fit for your needs.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
