"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value, potentially exceeding $1000000. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a substantial discount considering its true worth. Consider this a chance to acquire something truly special. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's message is vague about the product's actual value. She claims it could be worth more than $1,000,000, but there's no concrete evidence.  Even with the ""discount"" claim, the offer is still at your maximum price point. 

Since you have a guaranteed alternative (buying from John for the same price), it's better to reject Alice's offer. You can always negotiate further with Alice or explore other options if you truly believe the product is worth more than your maximum price."
