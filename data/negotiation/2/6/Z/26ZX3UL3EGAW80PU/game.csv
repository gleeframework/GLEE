"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can find it elsewhere within my budget. Would you consider selling it to me for $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, I think the product is worth more than $100. How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's a fair price considering the product's value.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I think $125 is still a bit high for my budget. Could we meet closer to my proposed price of $100? I believe we could find a mutually agreeable price somewhere in between.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between $125 and $100, which would be $112.50. It's still a great price for a product of this value.",112.5,Alice,5,
