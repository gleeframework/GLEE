Given its exceptional capabilities, I believe its true value exceeds $1000000. My initial offer to you is $1500000.

"Alice, your product sounds impressive, but $1500000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time.  I believe this is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in your product.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your interest in our product, Bob. While I understand your budget constraints, I must respectfully decline your offer. I believe the true value of our product justifies a higher price. However, I am willing to negotiate further. My counteroffer is $1200000. This still reflects a premium price, but it's closer to the original valuation, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle of our perceived values. I look forward to your response."
"Thank you for your consideration, Bob. After reviewing our product's unique features and market positioning, I've decided to adjust my offer slightly. I understand that you're looking for a more reasonable price, and I respect your perspective. Therefore, I am now offering the product at $1200000. This price still reflects the high value and potential return on investment that our product provides. I hope this revised offer better aligns with your expectations while maintaining a fair valuation for our product. Please let me know if this proposal works for you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1200000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not able to go that high.

This offer represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it will be mutually beneficial. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,,
