"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $95 for it. This is a fair deal considering its worth to you is $80, and it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something valuable at a slightly higher but still reasonable cost. Please let me know if you're interested in proceeding with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $80 from John, so there's no point in paying $95."
