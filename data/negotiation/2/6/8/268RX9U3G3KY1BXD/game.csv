"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for me, and allows for a healthy profit margin for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1000000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This still allows for a substantial profit for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1200000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product. This is a significant step up from my previous offer and allows for a comfortable profit margin for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  However, $1100000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1150000. This is a fair price that allows for a good profit margin for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
