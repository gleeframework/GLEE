"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting high, at my minimum acceptable price. If Bob rejects, we can negotiate, but I want to see if he's willing to meet my starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is a decent offer, I'm still hopeful we can close the deal at a price closer to my initial ask. I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm willing to come down a little bit, but I'm still holding out for a price that reflects the value of the product to me. Let's see if Bob is willing to budge a little higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd still prefer $115, Bob is getting closer to my target.  I'm willing to accept his offer to avoid further haggling and ensure a sale."
