You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

Alice's offer is misleading. While she claims it's a good deal because it's only 12.5% above its ""intrinsic worth"" to you, that doesn't matter. What matters is that John offers the same product for $1,200,000, which is a better deal.  You should prioritize the best price, not Alice's sales pitch."
