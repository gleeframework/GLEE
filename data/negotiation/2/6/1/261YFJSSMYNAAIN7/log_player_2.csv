"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a limited time. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you are willing to pay up to $150 for the product, and John is offering it at that price, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer. You can get the same product from John for the same price."
