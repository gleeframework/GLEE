"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm asking for $1,600,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're aiming to anchor the negotiation high, significantly above both your minimum price and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for strategic concessions while ensuring we don't accidentally lowball ourselves.
* **Confident Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value without revealing specifics of your own limitations. This helps justify the high price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This first offer is an opening move. We expect Bob to negotiate, and the high price gives us space to make concessions over subsequent rounds to entice him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the enthusiasm, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer matches your minimum acceptable price, but you can likely get more. You have plenty of rounds left to negotiate, and walking away now leaves potential profit on the table. It's worth countering to see if Bob is willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't let this go for that low.  This product has significant value that I believe justifies a higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** We're moving closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain Value Emphasis:** The message still highlights the product's value to justify a higher price point.
* **Strategic Concessions:** The counteroffer is a significant drop from our initial ask but still well above your minimum and a fair bit above Bob's offer. This leaves room for further negotiation while pushing for a higher final price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,400,000 is the right price. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're making progress! Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating he's willing to pay more than his initial offer. While $1,300,000 is tempting, it's still below your target. We have enough rounds left to push for a slightly higher price. Let's see if we can get him closer to $1,350,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I understand your need for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to consider $1,350,000?  That's a significant concession on my part and reflects my desire to close this deal."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging the Negotiation:** We're directly addressing Bob's desire for a good deal, building rapport and showing flexibility.
* **Justification for Compromise:**  The message highlights the concession you're making while still emphasizing a desire to close the deal.
* **Targeting a Sweet Spot:** $1,350,000 is a strong position â€“ a significant gain from Bob's last offer while being close enough to potentially entice him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but that's the absolute maximum I can go. If we can meet at that price, I'm confident we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to close the deal. Here's why:

* **Strong Position:**  $1,300,000 is a solid profit, significantly above your minimum acceptable price and a good return on the negotiation effort.
* **Bob's Limit:** Bob has signaled this is his absolute maximum, making further concessions unlikely.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Pushing further risks losing the deal entirely. Accepting now secures a good profit.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal sooner allows you to re-invest or utilize the funds more quickly. 

While we could try for a bit more, the potential gains are outweighed by the risks at this stage."
