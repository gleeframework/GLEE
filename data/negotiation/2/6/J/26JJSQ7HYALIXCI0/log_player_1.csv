"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it'd be a great fit for you. My asking price is $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80 but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:** My message highlights the potential benefit of the product for Bob, which might encourage him to accept. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message ends with an open-ended question, encouraging Bob to engage in a conversation and potentially make a counter-offer. 

This approach balances the need to maximize profit with the possibility of a quick deal while keeping the door open for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm willing to negotiate further. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price.  This approach is more strategic than immediately accepting Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $80 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. "", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer ($100) and Bob's offer ($80).  
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob that even at $90, he's getting a good deal.
* **Fair Profit:** I'm emphasizing the need for a fair profit on my side.  
* **Staying Firm:**  I'm staying firm on my position of not accepting his initial offer.

This counteroffer strikes a balance between being flexible and holding my ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I can see you're willing to meet me halfway, so I'll do the same. How about we go with $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $85 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80.  While I could try to push for $90 again, I've already rejected his offer once, and there are only 6 rounds left.  The risk of further negotiation falling apart and ending up with the $80 offer from John is too high.

It's important to balance maximizing profit with the risk of losing the deal altogether. Accepting Bob's offer at $85 ensures a sale and a profit, while minimizing the risk of ending up with a lower offer or no sale."
