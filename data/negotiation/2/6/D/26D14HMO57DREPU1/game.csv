"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it.",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $110 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $115? That's still a great price for a product worth $120. Let me know what you think.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $105 just doesn't work for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? That's still a good price for you, and it's closer to my value for the product.  Let's make this happen!",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $110. I'm willing to pay $108 for the product. I think that's a fair price, considering the value I'll get from it.",108.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $108 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference one last time and go with $109.  It's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",109.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $109 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $107 for the product. I'm confident that's a fair price, considering the value I'll get from it.",107.0,Bob,8,
