"That's a bit high for me, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $110 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $95? That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $95 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $105.  That's a good compromise, and it ensures we both get a fair deal.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $98. That would be a good deal for both of us, and we can close this out.",98.0,Bob,6,
