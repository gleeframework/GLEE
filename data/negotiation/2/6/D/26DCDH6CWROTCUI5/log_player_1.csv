{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's higher than your minimum value, giving you room to negotiate. It's also a reasonable starting point to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: That's a bit high for me, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value.  I will reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $110 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $95? That would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not ideal. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $95 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $105.  That's a good compromise, and it ensures we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $98. That would be a good deal for both of us, and we can close this out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $98 is closer to my minimum value, I've already gone through multiple rounds of negotiation and haven't been able to reach a price I'm happy with. Rather than continue to negotiate, I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. This ensures I meet my minimum value and avoid further haggling."
