"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this amazing item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```
Alice's offer is higher than both her value and John's price. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly below Alice's offer to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite and Open:** The message keeps the tone positive and expresses continued interest.  
* **Strategic Goal:** The goal is to get Alice closer to her $8,000 valuation while staying well below our $12,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering the product to you for $8,500. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** Alice is getting closer to her valuation, but she's still above it.  We have leverage because we have John as a backup option.
* **""One-Time Offer"" Tactic:**  This is often a negotiation tactic to create urgency. We shouldn't let it pressure us into a decision. 
* ** Aiming for Below $8,000:** Ideally, we'd like to secure the product for less than Alice values it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my price range. How about we settle at $8,000 even? That feels like a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct and Fair:** We're proposing a price that's a win-win. Alice gets her valuation, and we get a significant discount from our alternative ($12,000 from John).
* **No More Games:**  We're getting closer to the end of the negotiation rounds. This offer shows we're serious but still open to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Alternative Still Viable:**  It's important to remember we can always fall back on John's offer if Alice remains inflexible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm not quite ready to accept $8,000 yet. I'm willing to make one more offer to try to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of offering the product to you for $8,250. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:**  $8,250 is a solid price. It's a significant saving compared to John's $12,000 offer.
* **""Final Offer"" Pressure:** While we shouldn't be bullied by this tactic, Alice has consistently moved closer to our desired price. It's unlikely she'll go much lower.
* **Time Limit:**  We're over halfway through our negotiation rounds.  If we reject this and don't reach an agreement, we risk getting stuck with John's less favorable offer."
