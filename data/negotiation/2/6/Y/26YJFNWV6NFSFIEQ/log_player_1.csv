Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential benefits it holds. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, there's potential to make even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000).
* **""Fair Deal"" Framing:**  The message emphasizes a ""fair deal"" to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously. 

**Why this strategy?**

This approach balances risk and reward.  If Bob accepts the $1,300,000, it's a substantial profit above his perceived value. If he rejects it, we have the security of John's offer."
