"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I think it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000, which is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. While it's a fair price considering her value of $1,500,000, it's still not within your budget. You can get the same product from John for $1,000,000, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best option to save money."
