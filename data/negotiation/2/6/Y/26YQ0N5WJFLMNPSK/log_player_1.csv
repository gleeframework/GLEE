Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. Given my research and the market value, I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 undervalues the product significantly.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,750,000 is still outside my range. I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,000,000. I believe this price is fair and reflects the true value of the product. If you're unwilling to meet me at this point, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.

Bob seems firmly rooted at $1,000,000, which is too significant a loss for me. It's time to move on to John who's offering a price that reflects the product's true value."
