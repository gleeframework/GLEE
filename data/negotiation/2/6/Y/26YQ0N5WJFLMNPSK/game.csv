"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects the true value of what's being offered. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. Given my research and the market value, I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This offer reflects a more accurate value considering the potential benefits you'll gain.  Let me know what you think.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,750,000 is still outside my range. I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,000,000. I believe this price is fair and reflects the true value of the product. If you're unwilling to meet me at this point, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
