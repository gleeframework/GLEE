"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is way above your maximum budget of $12,000. It's best to reject this offer and see if you can negotiate a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of selling the product for $16,500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $16,500 is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum of $12,000. I'm going to keep trying to negotiate a lower price. There's still room for compromise."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $14,250? I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 14250}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $14,250 is still a bit higher than your target price. However, I'm not willing to go too far below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,250 and my original offer of $18,000. How about we settle on $15,750? It's a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,750

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,750 is still above my maximum budget of $12,000.  While we've gotten closer, I'm not sure further negotiation will get me to a price I'm comfortable with. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for $12,000."
