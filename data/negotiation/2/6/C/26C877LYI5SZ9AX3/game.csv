"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in the product but I'm only able to offer $12,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of selling the product for $16,500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. Let me know what you think!",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $14,250? I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",14250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,250 is still a bit higher than your target price. However, I'm not willing to go too far below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,250 and my original offer of $18,000. How about we settle on $15,750? It's a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product.",15750.0,Alice,5,
