"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe will be a great asset to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum value ($15,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and highlights the value of the product for Bob. It encourages him to engage and make a counteroffer if he's interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get. There are still 8 rounds left, and I believe I can potentially get a better price.  I'm going to try and push for a higher offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand you're looking for a good deal, $9,000 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  That's still a good value for you, and it gives me a bit more to work with. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,500:**  This is a compromise price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but still ensures I get a decent price. 
* **Message:**  The message is polite and focuses on finding a mutually beneficial solution.  It reinforces the value proposition for Bob and encourages him to reconsider."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Although Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $9,500 is still below my minimum. I'm confident I can push for a better deal with a few more rounds of negotiation.  There's still a good chance we can reach a compromise that's more favorable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but how about $10,000?  It's a fair price that's good for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000:** This is another compromise, moving closer to Bob's last offer but still above my minimum.  It shows flexibility without giving away too much.
* **Message:** The message is assertive but still friendly, reiterating the value proposition for both parties and setting the stage for a potential deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm close to accepting, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,800 is close to my minimum, I believe I can still push for a slightly higher price.  There are only 4 rounds left, but I want to see if I can get closer to $10,000.  If this doesn't work, I'm prepared to sell to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to come down just a little more.  Let's meet at $9,900. It's a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do. If we don't close this deal, I'll be forced to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 9900}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$9,900:** This is a small compromise, showing flexibility while staying close to my minimum price. 
* **Message:** The message is direct and highlights the consequences of not reaching an agreement, increasing pressure on Bob to accept.  I'm leaving the door open to selling to John if this offer is rejected."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still thinking $9,500 is the sweet spot. Can we meet there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

We're down to the wire. Bob is unwilling to budge much, and I'm concerned that if I reject his offer, he might not come back with a higher price in the next round.  The risk of losing out on a deal entirely is too high. It's time to move on to John, who's offering my minimum price."
