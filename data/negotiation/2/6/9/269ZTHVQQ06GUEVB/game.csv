"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1000000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. I hope we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to make a final compromise and offer you the product for $950000. This price is a fair reflection of the product's value and allows for a win-win situation for both of us. I'm confident that this is the best possible outcome for both parties. ",950000.0,Alice,5,
