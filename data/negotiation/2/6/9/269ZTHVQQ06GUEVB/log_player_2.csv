"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's meet halfway. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Bob should continue negotiating to try and reach a price he's comfortable with. There's still room for Alice to come down further, and Bob doesn't want to settle for a price that's too high for him."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to make a final compromise and offer you the product for $950000. This price is a fair reflection of the product's value and allows for a win-win situation for both of us. I'm confident that this is the best possible outcome for both parties.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $950,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. At this point, it's clear that Alice isn't willing to go any lower, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a more favorable price. It's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $800,000, ensuring he stays within his budget and secures the product."
