"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $16,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get this amazing item.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While I think it's a great product, $16,000 is still more than I'd like to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $15,500. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value.",15500.0,Alice,5,
