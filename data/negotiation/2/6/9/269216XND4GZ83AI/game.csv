"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $800,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $700,000. I believe this is a fair price given the potential of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and potential.",750000.0,Alice,3,
