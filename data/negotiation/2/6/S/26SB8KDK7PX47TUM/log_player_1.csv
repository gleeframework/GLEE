"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point because it's below Bob's value but still gives me a decent profit. I want to see if I can get closer to his value without having to go too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low, and while it's tempting to accept, it's better to keep negotiating. I want to see if I can get a better price. I'm also not sure if I'm willing to accept anything under $120. I'll see what happens in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm offering $125, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this compromise will be appealing to Bob, and we can reach a deal before he walks away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below what I'm willing to accept.  I'll reject this offer and see if we can find a middle ground.  I'm concerned that if I continue to reject offers, Bob will walk away, but I'm still hoping to get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm going to lower my offer to $115. I'm getting a bit nervous about the possibility of Bob walking away, but I'm still hoping to get a price closer to my initial offer. This is my last chance to see if we can compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum. It's tempting to accept, but I'm running out of time. If I keep rejecting, I risk losing him entirely. Selling to John guarantees me $100, which is my minimum.  It's better to secure that than risk getting nothing at all."
