**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $1,100,000, while John is selling it for $1,500,000. 
* **You save money:** By accepting Alice's offer, you save $400,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **You still get a good deal:** While Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to her ($800,000), it's still within your budget and significantly lower than your own valuation of the product ($1,500,000)."
