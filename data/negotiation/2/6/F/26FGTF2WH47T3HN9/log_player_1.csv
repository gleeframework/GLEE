{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll really value. I'm asking for $12,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave some room for negotiation.  I'm also being friendly and positive to build a good rapport.  Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is close to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I believe I can push for a higher price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're not willing to go as low as I initially offered, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll offer $9,750. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've considered Bob's counteroffer, but I'm getting the sense that we're not going to reach an agreement that works for both of us.  While $9,750 is closer to my minimum, I'm not comfortable taking a significant loss.  John is a safe bet, and I'd rather sell to him and ensure I get my minimum value."
