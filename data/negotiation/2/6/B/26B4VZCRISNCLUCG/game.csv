"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe will be a great asset to you. I'm offering it for $10,000, which is a fantastic deal considering its value. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be within my budget. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, how about $9,500? This would be a fantastic deal for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my target price.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial price, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $9,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway with your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,250. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to get this deal done. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but I need to be honest with you, I'm also considering buying the product from John for $8,000. I'd like to make a serious offer, so how about $8,800? This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",8800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're considering John's offer, but $8,800 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to make one final compromise and offer you the product for $9,100.  This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a great value. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll be moving forward with John.  The decision is yours.",9100.0,Alice,7,
