"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm confident this offer reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price point. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher final price. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $2,300,000, I'm setting a high anchor. This can influence Bob's perception of the product's value and make subsequent offers seem more reasonable in comparison.
* **Leaving Room:**  Even if Bob outright rejects this initial offer, there's a substantial buffer to work with in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still significantly higher than his perceived value ($1,000,000). This suggests there's room for further negotiation. You're willing to go lower, but not this early in the process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table. While your offer is closer to what I had in mind, there's still a gap.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $2,000,000?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** This counteroffer shows Bob you're willing to negotiate but also maintains a strong position. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:** By proposing a price exactly between your last offer and Bob's counteroffer, you're suggesting a sense of fairness.  
* **Maintaining Value:**  You're still well above both Bob's perceived value and your minimum, keeping the possibility of a profitable deal alive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I'd like to keep the negotiations within my budget. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer, but $1,900,000 is still a significant markup from Bob's $1,000,000 valuation.  There's no rush to settle, and we still have room to negotiate downwards a bit more.  We'll aim to guide him closer to the $1,700,000-$1,800,000 range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it seems like we're getting close. I value your willingness to negotiate, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle on $1,950,000? This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your budgetary considerations."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** By reducing your counteroffer by only $50,000, you signal that you're nearing your bottom line. 
* **Justification:** Emphasizing fairness and a ""win-win"" solution encourages Bob to see this offer favorably.
* **Time Pressure:**  With fewer rounds remaining, you're subtly increasing the time pressure on Bob to reach a deal before you consider other options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your effort to find a compromise. My final counteroffer is $1,925,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:**  At $1,925,000, you're still securing a significant profit margin above your minimum price and significantly more than Bob values the product at. 
* **Bob's ""Final"" Counteroffer:** The language Bob used suggests he's unlikely to go much higher. Pushing further risks jeopardizing the deal.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now provides immediate value and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiations.  While John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, the extra $425,000 from Bob is a worthwhile premium."
