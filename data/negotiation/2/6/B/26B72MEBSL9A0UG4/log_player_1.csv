"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 15000} 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to see if Bob is seriously interested in the product and how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering a price that's still higher than my minimum but lower than my initial offer. I'm hoping this will show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but I still value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now above my minimum value and getting closer to what I would like.  I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product for $10,500.  While I could potentially get a bit more, there's a risk that Bob will reject my counteroffer and I'll end up with less than $10,000."
