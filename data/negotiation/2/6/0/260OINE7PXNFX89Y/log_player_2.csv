{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than what I can afford right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and allowing for a reasonable profit for you. This price is fair, considering the product's worth to you and the potential opportunity cost if we can't reach an agreement. Let's find common ground and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
