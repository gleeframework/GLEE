"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its value to you and still well above what I'd receive elsewhere.  Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's worth it for me.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for. How about we split the difference and settle on $900,000? I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $875,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",875000.0,Bob,4,
