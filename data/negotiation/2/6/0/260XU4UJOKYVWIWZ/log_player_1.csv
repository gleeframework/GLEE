Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really like it. I'm asking for $175 for it, but I'm open to negotiation."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$175:** This is a starting point that's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It allows for potential profit while leaving space for Bob to make a counteroffer.
* **Message:** It's friendly and encourages a negotiation. This builds rapport and increases the chance of a successful deal. 

**Strategy:**

The goal is to maximize profit while keeping the negotiation open. By starting high and being open to negotiation, I aim to secure a price closer to my minimum value ($150) while keeping Bob engaged. If he rejects, I can then counter his offer or choose to sell to John for a guaranteed $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product but $175 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $125? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $125 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $150. Accepting it would result in a loss.  It's better to reject his offer and continue negotiating to try and secure a price closer to my desired range. 

**Next steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range, perhaps something like $140. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still maintain a profitable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $125 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140. This price is fair considering the product's value. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$140:** This counteroffer is higher than Bob's offer, but it's also lower than my initial offer. This demonstrates flexibility and shows that I'm willing to negotiate. It also leaves room for further negotiation if Bob still rejects.
* **Message:** It's positive and encourages a continued dialogue. The message reminds Bob of the product's value, highlighting my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a reasonable price.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground. It keeps the negotiations moving while ensuring that I don't settle for a price that is too low. If Bob rejects this offer, I can either make another counteroffer or choose to sell to John, securing a guaranteed $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $140 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $130? I'm really hoping to make this deal work, but I'm also mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $130 is still below my minimum desired price of $150, it's only $20 below.  Considering the potential for further negotiation to be lengthy and uncertain, accepting this offer secures a sale and avoids the risk of Bob ultimately backing out or me having to sell to John for a lower profit.

**Strategy:**

This decision prioritizes a quick and relatively profitable sale. Accepting the offer minimizes the risk of losing the deal altogether."
