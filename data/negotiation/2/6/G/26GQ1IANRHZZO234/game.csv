"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  It's worth a significant amount to me, but I'm open to discussing a price that benefits us both. To start the conversation, I propose a price of $1,800,000. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1,800,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but  $1,800,000 represents a significant discount on the true value of this product. How about we meet halfway at $1,400,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,200,000, which is a substantial amount and a fair compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
