"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $130 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good deal too.",125.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about $115? That's a fair compromise.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $115. I think the product is worth more than that. How about we try $122? I'm willing to give a bit more, but I need to make sure I get a good deal too.",122.0,Alice,5,
