Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $15,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer lined up."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Since you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000, any amount above that is a bonus.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning another offer, you create a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.
* **Justification:** While you don't need to explicitly justify the price, implying the product's value through phrasing like ""worth a significant amount"" can make the offer more palatable. 

**Important Note:**  This is a single-round negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, you will sell to John for $10,000. There's no opportunity for counter-offers in this scenario."
