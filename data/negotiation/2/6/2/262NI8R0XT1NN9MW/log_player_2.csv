"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial valuation of $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. Therefore, rejecting the offer and attempting to negotiate a lower price makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you being flexible. However, $12,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is my best offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than Alice's initial valuation, it still exceeds Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. Since John is willing to sell the product for $10,000, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy from John."
