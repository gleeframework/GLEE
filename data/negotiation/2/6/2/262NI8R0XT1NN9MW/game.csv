"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you being flexible. However, $12,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is my best offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11500.0,Alice,3,
