"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $10,500? That's a significant discount from my original offer and still leaves me with a decent profit. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which would be $9,750. Would you be willing to accept that price?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,750 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,750 and my last offer, which would be $10,125. This would be a great deal for both of us, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know if you're interested.",10125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,125 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $9,750 and $10,125, which would be $9,938.25. This is as high as I can go, and I hope you'll consider it.",9938.25,Bob,6,
