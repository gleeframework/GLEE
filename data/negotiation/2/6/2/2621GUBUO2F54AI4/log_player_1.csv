Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $149. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible since I have a guaranteed buyer at that price (John).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While I want a price close to my minimum, starting at $149 allows for the possibility of Bob countering with a slightly higher offer.  
* **Avoid a Lowball Offer:**  Offering a price significantly lower might make Bob suspicious or undervalue the product. 
 
Let's see if Bob bites!"
