"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from it for my business.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I appreciate your offer, $1200000 is significantly below what I need to secure for this product. I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while giving you a significant value proposition. Let's find a middle ground and finalize this deal.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $1750000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from it for my business. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. While $1400000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer the product for $1600000. This price recognizes the value you'll gain from the product while allowing me to cover my costs. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're trying to cover your costs, but $1600000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1550000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1550000.0,Bob,6,
