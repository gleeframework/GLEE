"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe is of great value. I'm starting with an asking price of $25000. I'm confident this price reflects its worth, but I'm open to negotiation. What are your thoughts?",25000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer, but $25000 is quite a bit above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to pay up to $12000 at this time.  Would you be willing to consider that offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $12000 is simply too low for me to consider at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $18000, which still represents a significant value for you. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $18000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $12000. It's the absolute maximum I can afford right now.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work.",12000.0,Bob,4,
