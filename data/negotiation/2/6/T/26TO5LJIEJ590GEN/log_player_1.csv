Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it can significantly benefit you.  I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000.  This is a unique opportunity, and I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. This maximizes potential profit.
* **Justification for Value:** The message highlights the product's ""immense value"" and potential benefits for Bob, aiming to justify the high price.
* **Openness to Discussion:**  The message leaves room for negotiation while still conveying the product's worth. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning ""exclusive opportunity,"" the message subtly implies that Bob might miss out if he doesn't act.

**Important Note:** While the offer is high, it's essential to be prepared to negotiate with Bob. He might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide if a slightly lower price is acceptable to avoid losing the sale altogether."
