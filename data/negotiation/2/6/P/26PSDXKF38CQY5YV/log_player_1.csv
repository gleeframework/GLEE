Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is a good point to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Profitable Price:** $900,000 is a strong profit, well above your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Meeting Halfway:** Bob's willingness to meet in the middle signals he's serious and unlikely to go much higher.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging out negotiations risks losing the deal entirely. Accepting now secures a good outcome."
