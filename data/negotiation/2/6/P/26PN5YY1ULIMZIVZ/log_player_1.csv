Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $15,000. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find some middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a fair compromise. Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you coming down, but $10,500 is still too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,750? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to negotiate, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,125? This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth the investment.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10125}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,125 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,900. This would be a good deal for both of us and allow us to close this deal.  What do you say?
