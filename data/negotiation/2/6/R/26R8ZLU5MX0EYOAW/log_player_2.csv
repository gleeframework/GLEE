Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price. You can likely get a slightly better deal by continuing to negotiate, but there's a risk that you'll run out of time or Alice will get impatient. At this point, it's better to secure the product at $6,250 and avoid the risk of losing the deal altogether."
