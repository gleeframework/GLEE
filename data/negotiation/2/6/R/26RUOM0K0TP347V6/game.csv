"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $15,000 to you. I am looking to sell it to you at $12,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire an asset worth significantly more than what you're paying for it.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $9,500 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about $8,700? That's a fair price that considers both our positions.",8700.0,Bob,4,
