Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you first for $130."",
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:** It's always best to start with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still make a profit.
* **Gauge Interest:** This initial offer will help you understand how interested Bob is and give you a baseline for future negotiations. 
* **Leave Room for Counteroffers:**  Since Bob values the product at $150, there's a decent chance he might counter with a price higher than your minimum of $80, even if he doesn't accept the initial offer.
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $80 gives you leverage. You can walk away from the negotiation with Bob if it's not going in your favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good offer, there's still room for negotiation. Bob is willing to pay $150, so he might be willing to go a bit higher. By rejecting and countering, we can try to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. How about we meet in the middle at $125?"",
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This is a classic negotiation tactic that often feels fair to both parties. It shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Small Increment:** By only reducing the price by $5, we signal that we're not desperate to sell and believe in the product's value.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** We're still above our minimum of $80 and have John as a backup option if Bob remains firm at $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Offer:** $115 is still significantly higher than our minimum price of $80 and a reasonable profit.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield small increments, and there's a risk of Bob losing interest.
* **Time Value:** Accepting the offer now secures the sale and avoids potentially lengthy negotiations. 

While we could push for a slightly higher price, the likelihood of a significant increase is slim and might not be worth the risk of losing the sale."
