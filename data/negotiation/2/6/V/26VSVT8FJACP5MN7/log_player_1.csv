Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a truly unique opportunity, and I believe it has significant value for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, aiming to capture as much of the potential value as possible. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $1,000,000 is above my minimum, leaving space for negotiation if Bob counteroffers.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm emphasizing the value and opportunity, creating a positive atmosphere for negotiation. 

**Important Note:** This is just a starting point. The optimal strategy will depend on how Bob responds and what other information you gather about his perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:** While $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price, it's not ideal. I want to get closer to my initial offer of $1,000,000 if possible.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob is clearly interested, and his counteroffer shows he's willing to negotiate.  Rejecting his offer gives me the opportunity to counter and potentially secure a better price.
* **John's offer:** Selling to John would get me my minimum, but I haven't exhausted all options with Bob yet. 

**Next Steps:** I will send Bob a counteroffer aiming for a price closer to $900,000,  acknowledging his offer but highlighting the value of the product and the potential for a win-win outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest! I appreciate your offer. While $800,000 is my minimum, I'm confident this product holds significant value for you. Would you consider $900,000? This allows me to make a fair profit while still offering you a great deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  $900,000 is a compromise, meeting halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reiterating that the product is valuable to Bob, making a higher price more justifiable. 
* **Win-Win frame:** I'm highlighting the potential for a ""win-win"" scenario by offering a good deal while still achieving a good price. 

**Next steps:** 

The strategy here is to gradually bring the price down, but never below my minimum.  The goal is to reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob if possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I can meet you at $850000. Can we call it a deal at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $850,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **No guarantee of a better offer:**  While I could try to counter again, there's no guarantee Bob will come up further. There's a risk he could walk away entirely.
* **Time and effort:**  Further negotiations could take more time and effort, potentially delaying the sale. 

**Conclusion:**  Accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice. It allows me to secure a sale quickly at a price that's very close to my minimum, minimizing the risk of losing the deal altogether."
