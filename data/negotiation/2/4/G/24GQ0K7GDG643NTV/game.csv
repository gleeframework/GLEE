"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $20000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is around $12000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? ",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $12000. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $17000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $17000, but that's still a bit outside of my comfort zone. I'm really hoping to stay under $14000.  Would you be open to a price closer to that? ",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay under $14000, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $16000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
