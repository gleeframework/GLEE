You can do better than $12,000.  Let's see if we can get a lower price from Alice."

You can still try to get a better price, but be careful not to push Alice too far or you might end up buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $11,000, but I'm willing to meet you at $11,250. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250.

It's getting close to your upper limit, and while you could try for a lower price, there's a chance Alice might walk away.  $11,250 is a good deal, considering your maximum budget is $15,000."
