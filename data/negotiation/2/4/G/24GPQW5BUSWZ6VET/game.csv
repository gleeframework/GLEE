"I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

"I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $11,000, but I'm willing to meet you at $11,250. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,5,
