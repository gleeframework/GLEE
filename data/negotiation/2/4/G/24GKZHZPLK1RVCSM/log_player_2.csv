"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is a very competitive offer considering its value to you is $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's tempting to take the deal, it's better to try and negotiate further to get a lower price.  You have 10 rounds to work with, so there's time to explore better options."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me. I believe it's a fair price considering the value you've placed on it. Let's see if we can make a deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's closer to my target, it's still not a good deal for me.  I'll continue to negotiate and see if I can get her to come down further. I have enough rounds to continue negotiating and there's still the option to purchase from John if this negotiation fails."

Round 4

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, $1,120,000 is still too high. I'm only $20,000 away from my target, but with a few rounds left, I want to see if I can push for a lower price. The option to purchase from John is still available, so I don't need to settle yet."
