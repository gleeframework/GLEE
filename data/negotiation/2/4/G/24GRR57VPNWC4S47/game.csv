"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time.  I'm willing to offer $950,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I've done some further research and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm aiming for.  However, I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000.  This would allow us both to make a reasonable deal. ",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,030,000, but that's as low as I can go. I believe the product's value to you is worth more than that, and I'm willing to take a small risk to get a deal done. Let's see if we can make it work.",1030000.0,Alice,5,
