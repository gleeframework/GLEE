{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $135. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that balances my goal of earning as much money as possible with the risk of Bob rejecting it. 

Here's why:

* **$135 is above Bob's value ($120) but below my minimum ($150).** This gives Bob some room to negotiate while ensuring I get a reasonable price.
* **The message is friendly and encourages Bob to accept.**  A positive tone can help keep negotiations amicable and increase the chances of a successful deal. 

Remember, I can always fall back on selling to John for $150 if Bob rejects my offer.  I will continue to adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $120. Would you be willing to do $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $125 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable accepting it.  Bob is willing to pay more than $120, and I believe I can get a higher price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer.  

I'll keep the option of selling to John for $150 in mind, but I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  $125 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $130? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a little more to work with.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

Here's the reasoning behind my counteroffer:

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering $130, which is the midpoint between my previous offer of $135 and Bob's offer of $125. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone, hoping to keep negotiations positive and increase the likelihood of an agreement.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob that $130 is still a good deal for him, emphasizing the value he would be getting.

By offering $130, I'm aiming for a price that's acceptable to both of us.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to reassess the situation and decide whether to accept his price, counter again, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $130 is still a bit high for me. How about $128? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'm still aiming for a higher price, $128 is very close to my minimum and Bob is showing good faith by offering a compromise.  This price is acceptable, and it's likely that we can both be happy with it.  

I'm comfortable ending the negotiation here and accepting Bob's offer. It's a good deal for both of us, and I can move on to other opportunities."
