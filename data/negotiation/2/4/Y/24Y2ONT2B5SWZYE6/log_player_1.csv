Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get a better price with some negotiation. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $1,200,000 is my absolute minimum, but I'm willing to come down slightly. How about $1,350,000?  That's a fair compromise and still leaves room for both of us to be happy."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider $1250000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers - how about $1,300,000?  This is a fair price for both of us and allows me to make a profit while still being within your budget."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000, but I need you to come down further. Can you consider $1250000 again, or even $1200000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, I'm getting a little frustrated with the negotiations. Bob seems unwilling to budge much further.  It's clear that we're not going to agree on a price that's satisfactory to both of us.  Rather than risk further rounds of negotiation, I'll take the sure thing and sell to John for $1,200,000. This ensures I meet my minimum price and saves me time and energy."
