"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000.  I think it's a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This reflects the value I place on it, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is now $13,000.** This is still a good deal for Bob, as it's below his maximum budget of $15,000 and closer to his desired price point. 
* **There's a risk in continuing to negotiate.**  Alice might not budge further, and Bob could end up paying the full $15,000 to John. 

It's better for Bob to accept this offer and secure the product at a price that's still within his budget and a reasonable compromise."
