"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you.  It's something I've priced at $9,500, but I'm willing to negotiate.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's room for negotiation. By rejecting her initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price."
