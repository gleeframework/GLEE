"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  It doesn't even come close to covering my costs. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and it still leaves a good margin for you to make a profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900,000 is a step in the right direction, but it's still not quite there for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would allow both of us to walk away with a fair deal. I'm confident that this product will generate significant value for your business, and this price reflects that potential.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, we're still significantly above our budget and John's offer. It's worth pushing Alice a bit further to see if we can get closer to our ideal price point."

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I can offer $950,000. That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's potential."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

We're inching closer to John's offer and trying to signal that our budget is limited. By increasing our offer slightly, we show continued interest and a willingness to negotiate, but we hold firm on staying below $1,000,000."
