"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1200000 is closer to what I'm looking for, it's still a bit lower than where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This price reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied.  Let me know if this works for you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but $1350000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1300000. Can you consider this revised offer?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
