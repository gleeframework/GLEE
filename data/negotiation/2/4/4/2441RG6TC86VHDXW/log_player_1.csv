Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This offer sets the price at $1,500,000.  Here's the reasoning:

* **Value to me:** I know the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me. 
* **John's offer:**  John's offer of $1,000,000 is my safety net. 
* **Potential upside:** By setting a price of $1,500,000, I have a chance to earn $500,000 more.  This is a significant profit, and it's worth the risk if Bob values the product highly enough.

This strategy balances my desire to maximize profit with the need to secure a sale if Bob rejects the offer."
