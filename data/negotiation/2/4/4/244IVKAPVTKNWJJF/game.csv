"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I've done my research and I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product to me. However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a significant profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your desire to meet in the middle, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a good compromise and a great deal for both of us.  Let's try to reach an agreement at this price.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $887,500. It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",887500.0,Alice,5,
