Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, he's unlikely to reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering. At this point, the difference between Bob's potential offer and John's guaranteed offer is too small to risk losing the sure sale. It makes more sense to cut negotiations with Bob and secure the $1,200,000 from John."
