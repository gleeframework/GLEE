"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I've carefully assessed its value, and considering its potential benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair offer, reflecting the significant value this product holds. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, however, $1,100,000 is significantly below the true value of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects its worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This offer stands as a testament to my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,250,000 is still a little steep for my budget. How about we settle at $1,175,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. While $1,175,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price point. Would you consider $1,210,000? This considers the significant value proposition of the product while acknowledging your budget concerns.",1210000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. Would you be willing to do $1,192,500?",1192500.0,Bob,6,
