"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me a good starting point and leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and how high he is willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for that low just yet. There are still 8 rounds left, and I can try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,300,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum, and with several rounds still left, I'm willing to take the deal.  $1,250,000 is a good outcome."
