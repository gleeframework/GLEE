Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000. This is a price that is significantly higher than what it's worth to him, but still leaves some room for negotiation and a potential profit for me.  I believe this is a good starting point, as it allows me to maximize my earnings while still leaving room to negotiate down if needed.  If Bob rejects this offer, I will analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or reject it.  I will also keep John's offer in mind and be prepared to sell to him if the negotiations with Bob don't prove fruitful."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value of $12,000, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to earn. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price, and I'm not willing to settle for $9,500.  If Bob doesn't agree to a better price, I'm always willing to sell to John for $12,000."

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer of $11,000, but it's still a price that is closer to my ideal profit margin.  I believe this offer is fair and leaves room for further negotiation.  If Bob accepts this offer, it's a win for both of us.  If he rejects it, I'll need to carefully consider my options, including selling to John."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is unwilling to budge from his offer of $9,500.  While this is closer to my minimum value than my initial offer, it's still not a price I'm comfortable with.  Given the risk of further negotiation with Bob not resulting in a more favorable outcome, and the fact that John is willing to pay my desired price of $12,000, I'm choosing to sell the product to John.  This ensures that I maximize my profit and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
