"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  Could you consider a price closer to $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
