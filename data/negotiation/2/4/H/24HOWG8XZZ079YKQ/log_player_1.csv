Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $110 is still a little low for me. How about $120? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and settle on $117? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 117}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still a bit above $117. How about we try $112? I'm willing to meet you halfway from $115, but I'd like to get a bit closer to my target. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $112 is a bit lower than I hoped for, it's still a decent profit and I only have four rounds left.  It's getting risky to keep rejecting offers and risking a deal with John."
