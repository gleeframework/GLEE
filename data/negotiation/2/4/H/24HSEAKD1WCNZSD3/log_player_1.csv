Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $12,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, there's room to negotiate a price higher than your minimum ($8,000) but lower than his maximum.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at $12,000 leaves room for potential negotiation (if Bob tries to haggle) while still aiming for a significant profit.
* **Alternative Option:** You have a safety net with John ($8,000), so you can afford to aim high with Bob.
* **Time Sensitivity (Implied):**  Mentioning listing it publicly implies that if Bob waits, he might miss out, subtly encouraging a quicker decision."
