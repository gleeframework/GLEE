I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on a unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $8,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $9,000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable spending. How about we settle at $7,000? That seems like a fair compromise.
