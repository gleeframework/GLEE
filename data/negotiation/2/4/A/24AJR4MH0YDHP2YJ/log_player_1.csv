I'm offering the product to Bob for $115. This is a fair price considering it's worth $120 to him and $100 to me. It gives us both room for a potential deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Bob's offer is close to my ideal price, and I'd rather secure the sale than risk further negotiation."
