"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to make a valuable investment. I'm willing to start with a price of $950,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $950,000 is still too high.  It's better to try to negotiate a lower price.  There's no immediate urgency to buy, and we have 10 rounds to try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $900,000. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is still too high. While it's a step in the right direction, it's still above my target price of $850,000. I'm confident that we can negotiate a lower price, and I want to continue to explore those options.  There are still 7 rounds left, so there's no rush to make a decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $900,000 is still too far from my budget. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This would allow you to make a comfortable profit while still offering me a fair price.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay above my minimum value. Let's try $920,000. I think this is a fair price that balances our interests.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $920,000 is still too high.  While she's making concessions, it's not enough for me to be comfortable. It's better to continue negotiating and try to get a lower price. We've got a few more rounds to see if we can reach an agreement closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $920,000 is still a bit too much for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go up to $890,000, which is a significant move for me, and I believe it gives you a healthy profit margin.  This feels like a good compromise that could benefit both of us."", ""product_price"": 890000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to meet you at $905,000, which is a slight increase from your last offer. I believe this is a fair price that balances our interests.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $905,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm comfortable with my counter-offer of $890,000, but I can't go higher than that. It's worth trying one more counter-offer to see if we can find a middle ground. We've still got 3 rounds left, and there's no rush to make a decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we've been going back and forth, and I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll offer you $895,000.  This is a very fair price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. If we don't reach a deal here, I'll have to consider my other options."", ""product_price"": 895000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your final concession, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, which is just $5,000 above your last offer. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you and my minimum requirements. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We've reached the 9th round, and Alice's final offer is still above my desired price point. While the difference is only $5,000, I'm not willing to budge further. I've done my best to negotiate, but it seems like we're at an impasse. With only one round remaining, it's not worth risking a deal falling through. Buying from John at $1,000,000 ensures I get the product and avoids potential further haggling.  It's the most pragmatic choice at this point."
