"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, considering my minimum value for the product is $150. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $120 is significantly lower than my minimum value, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering at $175. This is a compromise, as it's higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also want to get a reasonable price for my product."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While $140 is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $160. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise. I'm still above my minimum value and believe this could be an acceptable price for Bob."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've decided to sell the product to John for $150.  Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum value, but we're running out of rounds. I don't want to risk getting a lower price, especially since I have a guaranteed sale with John."
