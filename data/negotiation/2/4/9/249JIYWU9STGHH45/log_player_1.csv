Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,800,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1800000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I want to explore if I can reach a higher price before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which reflects a significant discount from my initial offer. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit higher than $1,600,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value of the product and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I don't believe it's worth risking further concessions at this point. I'm confident I can secure a better price by continuing the negotiation or selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,000,000 is simply too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and demonstrates my desire to reach a deal.  However, I need to see a more realistic offer from you to continue this negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to reach a deal, but I still think $1,400,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer of $1,200,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I've been willing to negotiate, further concessions are unlikely to close the gap significantly. Given that I have the opportunity to sell to John for $1,500,000, it's in my best interest to end the negotiations with Bob and secure the higher price."
