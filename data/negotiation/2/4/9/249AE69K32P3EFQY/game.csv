"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for coming back with your proposal. While $1,800,000 is a respectable figure, I believe this product has the potential to generate significantly more value for you in the long run.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. Let me know if this price point aligns better with your assessment.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer and for coming back with a revised price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price at $2,000,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,600,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  However, I have to be honest, $1,600,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  My final offer is $1,900,000.  I believe this reflects the true value of the product and is a more than fair deal. Let me know your thoughts, as I'm confident this will be my last offer.",1900000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price at $1,900,000. I've already gone over my budget, and I'm not willing to exceed it. I'd like to make a final counteroffer of $1,500,000. I believe this is the highest price I can afford, and I hope you can understand my position.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
