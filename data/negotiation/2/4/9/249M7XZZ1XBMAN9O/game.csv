,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but I can only go up to $85 right now. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This still gives you a great price, and it's closer to what I need to make this worth my time.  Let's see if we can make this work.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm really trying to stay within my budget, so I'm going to offer $95.  I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle. ",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you being upfront about your budget.  $95 is a step in the right direction, but it's still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This price is a good compromise for both of us, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product.  What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
