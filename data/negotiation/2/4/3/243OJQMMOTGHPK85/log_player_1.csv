Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really pushing the limits of my budget here, but I'm willing to go to $13,500.  This is a significant step for me, and I hope you'll consider it.  Let's find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

This is a good point to take the deal. Bob is clearly very interested and willing to negotiate, but he's also holding firm to his budget. Accepting $13,500 secures a profit above your minimum and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds."
