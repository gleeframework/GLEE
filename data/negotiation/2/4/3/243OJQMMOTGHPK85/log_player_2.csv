"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs. Given its value, I'm offering it at $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. It's  worth rejecting and negotiating further.  Bob has 9 rounds to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm very interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns.  While $18,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This is a significant discount and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's budget.  Bob has time to negotiate further and see if he can get closer to his target price.  It's worth trying a counteroffer to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $14,000? I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 14000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you clearly see the value in this product. Let's close this gap - I can do $15,000, but that's my absolute best offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer, $15,000 is still above Bob's budget. Bob still has time to negotiate and can potentially reach a price closer to his target. Rejecting this offer allows for another round of negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really pushing the limits of my budget here, but I'm willing to go to $13,500.  This is a significant step for me, and I hope you'll consider it.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 13500}
