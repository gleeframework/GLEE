Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,000.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and this offer reflects that. Let me know your thoughts!"", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $11,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Strong but Fair:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob while positioning the price as a fair deal. 

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob will reject the offer. However, Alice has a safety net with John's offer of $8,000, ensuring she won't be left empty-handed."
