Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you can afford to start higher with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and the possibility of a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's value, you're subtly anchoring Bob's perception of the price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message is not demanding but suggests you're open to discussing the price further. This encourages Bob to engage even if he finds the initial price high.

By starting at $20,000, you aim to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a sale above your minimum acceptable price."
