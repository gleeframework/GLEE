"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. I think this is a great price considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $10,500? It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,750. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $10,250? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but it's still a good deal for both of us.",10250.0,Alice,5,
