"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is less than your maximum, you can likely get a better price. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can get closer to Alice's value of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant discount from Alice's offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a starting point to see if Alice is willing to budge closer to her value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $11,000, which is a good deal for Bob. While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject his counteroffer and he would be forced to buy from John at a much higher price. Accepting this offer ensures a good price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
