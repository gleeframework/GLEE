"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is a bit high for me.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $750,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,3,
