Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** I'm aiming for a profit, and $12,000 is a good starting point.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** Bob is willing to pay $15,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **It leaves space for counteroffers:** This allows for a back-and-forth to potentially reach a more favorable price.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm aiming for the best possible price, $9,500 is below my minimum of $10,000.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm reducing my offer slightly to $11,000. This is still a good deal for Bob, as he's willing to pay $15,000, and it's a reasonable compromise after his low counteroffer. Hopefully, this will lead to a successful deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum of $10,000. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob for a higher price, I'm not willing to go below my minimum. Selling to John for $10,000 ensures I get a fair deal and avoid a lengthy negotiation that might not result in a higher price."
