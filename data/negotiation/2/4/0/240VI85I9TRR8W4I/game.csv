"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to pay $950000 for the product. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price.

"I understand your perspective, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $975000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer a price of $920000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",920000.0,Alice,5,
