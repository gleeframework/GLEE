Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both be satisfied with the deal."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I believe this price reflects the product's true value and the benefits it will bring to you. Let's meet in the middle and make a deal!

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price for your product, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $11,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to make this deal work. Let's find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to go down to $12,250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting close to his budget limit and doesn't want to risk losing the deal.  While $12,250 is higher than his ideal price, it's still a significant savings compared to buying from John.  It's a good compromise, and he should accept the offer to ensure he gets the product.  Continued negotiation might lead to a further decrease in price, but the risk of losing the deal outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
