"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product brings to the table is truly significant, and $1,200,000 undervalues it considerably.  I could be convinced to part with it for $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
