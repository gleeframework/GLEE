# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. This is a one-time offer, so I encourage you to seize this chance. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:**  Alice is offering the product for $1,100,000, which is less than Bob's maximum price of $1,200,000. 
* **Saving money is the goal:**  Bob wants to save as much money as possible. Accepting Alice's offer saves him $100,000 compared to buying from John."
