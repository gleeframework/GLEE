"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll find it to be a valuable addition to your collection. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,600,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He wants to pay less than $1,500,000 and Alice's offer is higher.  There are more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to consider my own valuation of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll sell it to you for $1,520,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,520,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,520,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's still aiming for a price below $1,500,000, and Alice's offer is above that. There are still rounds left to negotiate, and he can try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $1,520,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and agree on $1,460,000?  This is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1460000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,460,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll sell it to you for $1,480,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,480,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,480,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he was aiming for a price below $1,500,000, Alice has come down to $1,480,000 which is close enough and within his budget.  He should seize this opportunity as there are fewer rounds left and the risk of getting a worse offer or having to buy from John at $1,500,000 is high."
