Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,900 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer the product for $11,100. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value you'll get from the product.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower.  Getting the price down to $11,100 represents a good deal, and it's better to accept now rather than risk the negotiation falling apart."
