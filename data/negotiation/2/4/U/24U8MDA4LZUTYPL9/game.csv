"I'm interested in the product, but I think $950000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $475000. Can you consider this counteroffer?",475000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm afraid $475000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $700000?",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target, but $700000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $525000. Can you consider this counteroffer?",525000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $725000?",725000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're getting close to walking away, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I'm willing to meet you at $675000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",675000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $675000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $675000, but I need to get a bit closer to my target. Can you consider a slight adjustment to $670000?",670000.0,Bob,8,

"I've given you a lot of concessions, Bob, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $675000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium support package worth $25000, which brings the total value to $700000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",675000.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate the extras you're offering, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $670000, but I need to get as close to my target as possible. Can you reconsider and meet me at $670000?",670000.0,Bob,10,
