"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than what the product is worth to her ($1,000,000) but lower than your maximum budget ($1,200,000). This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer. However, I'm aiming to pay a bit less than that.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  This price reflects its value while giving us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I value your offer, I believe the product's inherent worth warrants a higher price.  I'd be willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end and still offers you a good deal.

Alice has come down from her initial offer, but it's still higher than what you're comfortable paying. There's still room for negotiation. You can counteroffer again and try to secure a lower price."
