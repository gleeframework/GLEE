Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to other buyers. I believe it will be highly valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, securing a deal with Bob allows us to potentially close the sale faster and avoid any potential complications.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob.  He might counter-offer, and we can potentially settle on a price between $1,400,000 and $1,500,000.
* **High but Reasonable:**  The offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), but the wording emphasizes exclusivity and potential value, hoping to justify the high price. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
