"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. This is a fair price considering its value and rarity. I'm confident you'll love it.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1800000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $1400000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1400000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1600000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1600000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1500000.  This is my final offer, as I have another seller ready to make the sale at that price.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1600000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $1550000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
