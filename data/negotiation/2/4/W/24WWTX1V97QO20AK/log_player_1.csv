Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $2,250,000 is outside my budget. Given the product's value to you at $1,500,000, I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This represents a fair price that allows for a reasonable profit for you while remaining within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the price of $1,250,000 undervalues the product's true potential. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,850,000? This allows us both to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 1850000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,850,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the value I see in this product. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let's find a solution that works.
