"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential for significant return on your investment. Let me know your thoughts.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $2,250,000 is outside my budget. Given the product's value to you at $1,500,000, I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This represents a fair price that allows for a reasonable profit for you while remaining within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the price of $1,250,000 undervalues the product's true potential. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,850,000? This allows us both to benefit from this deal.",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,850,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the value I see in this product. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. Let's find a solution that works.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
