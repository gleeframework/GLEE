"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. I'm open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is far too high. It's important to signal that you're looking for a much lower price.  We'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. Unfortunately, $22,000 is way beyond my budget for this product. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $10,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $10,000 is still a bit above our ideal price, it's a strong counteroffer that signals a willingness to negotiate while setting a firm lower boundary.
* **Leaving Room:** This offer leaves room for further negotiation. Alice is likely to counter, giving us the chance to move closer to our desired price. 
* **Polite and Professional:** Maintaining a positive and respectful tone is important for a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. However, $10,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $19,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved from her initial offer, $19,000 is still significantly higher than our target price and John's offer.  We need to show Alice we're serious about a lower price point. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $19,000 is still outside my budget. I'm serious about purchasing this, but only if we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $13,000?"",
""product_price"": 13000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Jump, But Still Room:** Offering $13,000 is a significant increase from our last offer, showing Alice we're willing to compromise. However, it's still substantially lower than her current price and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasizing Seriousness:**  We're reiterating our genuine interest while making it clear that the price is a dealbreaker. This reinforces the need for Alice to make a meaningful move if she wants to close the deal. 
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** We're aiming for a price closer to the middle ground between our initial offer and her last counteroffer. This strategy can sometimes accelerate the negotiation process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your persistence. I'm willing to move a bit further to meet you halfway. How about $16,000?  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Alice's use of ""final offer"" is likely a negotiation tactic. It doesn't necessarily mean she won't budge further, especially since we're still in early rounds. 
* **Too High:** $16,000 is still significantly higher than our $8,000 walk-away point and a long way from our previous offer. We need to show we're willing to walk away if necessary.
* **Alternative Option:** Having John's offer as a backup gives us leverage. By rejecting this offer, we signal to Alice that we have other options and aren't desperate to close the deal at any cost."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit. However, $16,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  I can go up to $14,000, but that's my absolute limit. I understand if that doesn't work for you, and I appreciate your time."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We're making it clear that $14,000 is our absolute maximum.  This sets a firm boundary while still showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Constraints:** By mentioning this is our limit, we're implying we have budget restrictions, which can add weight to our position.
* **Acknowledging the Walk-Away:** We're subtly reminding Alice that we have other options if the negotiation fails. This prevents us from appearing overly invested, which can weaken our position. 
* **Time Pressure:**  As we approach the halfway point in the rounds, we want to gently increase the time pressure on Alice. This might encourage her to settle closer to our price."
