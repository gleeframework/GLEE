"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. I'm open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. Unfortunately, $22,000 is way beyond my budget for this product. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $10,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum, and I have plenty of rounds to negotiate. I'll counter but leave room for further discussion.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. However, $10,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $19,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 19000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $19,000 is still outside my budget. I'm serious about purchasing this, but only if we can find a price that works for both of us. Would you consider $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit. However, $16,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  I can go up to $14,000, but that's my absolute limit. I understand if that doesn't work for you, and I appreciate your time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","This is a close call. Bob is clearly at his limit, and pushing further might scare him off. Accepting his offer nets me more than his initial offers.
