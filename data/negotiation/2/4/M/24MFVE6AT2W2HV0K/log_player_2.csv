"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is significantly higher. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident you'll find this price very competitive. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'm not interested in paying $1,100,000 for the product. That's way above my budget of $800,000. I'll reject Alice's offer and see if I can find a better deal elsewhere.
