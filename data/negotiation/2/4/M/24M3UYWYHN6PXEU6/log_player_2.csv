"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a significant discount from its true value. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer:**  $10,000
* **Your value:** $12,000 
* **John's price:** $12,000

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $2,000 compared to buying from John. Even though it's above Alice's valuation, it's still within your budget and a better deal than John's."
