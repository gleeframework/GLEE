"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident it can be a game-changer.  My initial offer is $900,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this product has great value, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider meeting me at this price?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but $750,000 is just too low. How about $850,000?  This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit, and I think it's a good starting point for further discussion.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $850,000. How about $800,000? This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
