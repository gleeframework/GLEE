"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really enjoy. It's worth at least $120 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $100.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I'll reject Alice's offer because the product is worth no more than $80 to me, and buying it from her for $100 would be too expensive. I'll look for a better deal.
