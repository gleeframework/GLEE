,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of your product, $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it, which I believe is a fair price given my maximum budget.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can see that you're interested in the product, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still above my budget. Let's split the difference â€“ I'll offer $1000000. This is the highest I can go without exceeding my financial limits.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $1400000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle again - I'll offer $1200000.  This is a serious offer, and I hope we can close the deal.",1200000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle again, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering it to you for $1600000.",1600000.0,Alice,7,
