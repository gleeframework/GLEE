"Alice, thanks for the offer.  $1,000,000 is a good start, but I'm looking to save as much as possible.  I'd be willing to pay $900,000.  This is a fair price that allows for a healthy profit for you while still being a great deal for me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I accept $950,000? It's a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal. ",950000.0,Alice,3,
