Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $200 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than your minimum, leaving room for negotiation. It also includes a friendly message to establish a positive tone and open the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I will try to negotiate a better price with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for your interest, Bob! $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $160? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 160} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $140 is only slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  It's better than selling to John for $150, and it saves me the time and effort of continuing negotiations."
