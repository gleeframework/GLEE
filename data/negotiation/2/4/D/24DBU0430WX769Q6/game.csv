"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the conversation.  However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still a bit too much for me at this time.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground here. What do you say?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see we're getting closer to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I need to make a bit more to make it worth my while. How about we try $11,250? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,100.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and we could finalize the transaction. What do you say?",11100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,100. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we try $11,750? I'm hoping we can get to a mutually beneficial agreement",11750.0,Alice,7,
