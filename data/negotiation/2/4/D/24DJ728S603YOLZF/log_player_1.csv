Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be very valuable to you.  I'm willing to let it go for $19,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still staying above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Gauge Interest:** The message is framed to gauge Bob's interest level without revealing your absolute bottom line. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob and ensuring you don't lose the sale to John."
