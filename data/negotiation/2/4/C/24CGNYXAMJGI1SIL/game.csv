"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm thinking of a starting price of $12,000. What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation. While the product seems interesting, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $9,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, and I'm glad we're making progress. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is still a bit steep for me. Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a good profit and me to acquire a product within my budget. What are your thoughts?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I believe it's a sweet spot that balances our interests. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,500 is still a little outside my budget. I'm feeling really good about $10,500. It's a fair compromise for both of us, and it would allow me to stay within my spending limits. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. It's a price that I think is fair considering the value the product brings to the table. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close! I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still a bit hesitant about $11,000, but I'm willing to meet you at $10,750. It's a small difference, but it would help me stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",10750.0,Bob,8,

"I think we're really close now, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,800. It's a small concession, but I think it's worth it to get a deal done. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,9,
