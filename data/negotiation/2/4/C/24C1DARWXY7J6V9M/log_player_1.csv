Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This is a starting point, a fair price that's above your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This strategy balances maximizing profit with keeping Bob interested in the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $8,500 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to Bob, and there's room for negotiation. I'll make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is a compromise that is still higher than Bob's offer but shows a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd like to get closer to my initial target, Bob's offer of $8,750 is very close to the value of selling to John, and further negotiation may risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting this offer is the most reasonable choice at this point."
