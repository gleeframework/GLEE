"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business, even more than my asking price reflects.  I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the potential value for Bob's business, I'm aiming to shift his focus from the price tag to the potential benefits.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  While my initial offer is high, I'm signaling my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Alternative Option (John):** I'm keeping in mind that I have John as a backup buyer at my desired price. This allows me to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to offer $1,100,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing interest, $1,100,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at such a steep discount. I'll use the next round to try and steer the negotiation closer to a price point that works for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and finding a middle ground is important to me as well. However,  $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the true capabilities and potential of this product.  To be realistic, I could consider a price of $1,900,000. This feels like a fair offer considering the long-term value it can bring to your business."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Counter:**  I want to maintain a positive and collaborative tone by recognizing Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Holding Firm (For Now):** While I'm lowering my price, I'm not drastically dropping to his level. The goal is to signal that I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm continuing to reinforce the inherent value of the product, hoping to nudge Bob's perception closer to mine.
* **Time Consideration:**  With several rounds remaining, I have some leeway to negotiate, but I need to start guiding the price upwards."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns about the value of the product, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'd like to offer $1,550,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could try to push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that our negotiations could stall. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit and avoids the potential loss of selling to John."
