"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business, even more than my asking price reflects.  I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to offer $1,100,000 for the product.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and finding a middle ground is important to me as well. However,  $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the true capabilities and potential of this product.  To be realistic, I could consider a price of $1,900,000. This feels like a fair offer considering the long-term value it can bring to your business.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns about the value of the product, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'd like to offer $1,550,000 for the product.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
