Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and finding a middle ground is important to me as well. However,  $1,100,000 significantly undervalues the true capabilities and potential of this product.  To be realistic, I could consider a price of $1,900,000. This feels like a fair offer considering the long-term value it can bring to your business.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
