Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $1,100,000 is significantly higher than your minimum of $800,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so there's room for him to counter without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It shows you're serious:**  By offering a price that's closer to your ideal outcome, you demonstrate you're willing to negotiate but also value the product.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is a decent amount, it's still below the initial offer and leaves room for a better deal. Since there's a possibility Bob might be willing to pay more, rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer is the better strategy."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer of $1,100,000 and Bob's offer of $950,000. 
* **Showing flexibility:** It demonstrates that you're willing to compromise while still aiming for a good price.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  It's still above your minimum of $800,000, keeping you in a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still room for improvement:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to your ideal price, it's still below what you believe the product is worth and what you can potentially get. 
* **Testing the waters:**  Rejecting Bob's offer will allow you to gauge how flexible he truly is.
* **Maintaining pressure:**  Continuing to negotiate shows that you are not desperate for a quick sale and are confident in the value of the product. 

By rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer, you can potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final push:** This counteroffer is a small increase from Bob's last offer, showing you're willing to be flexible but still want a fair price.
* **Close to agreement:** It's within a reasonable range of Bob's offer, increasing the chance of a deal.
* **Avoiding John's offer:** By offering a slightly higher price than John's offer, you're incentivized to close the deal with Bob, potentially securing a better outcome.

Let's see if Bob accepts this final counteroffer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

This is a tough call, but considering the following:

* **Negotiations are stalled:** It seems Bob isn't willing to go higher, and continued negotiation might lead to a deadlock.
* **John's offer:**  While $925,000 is not ideal, it's significantly better than John's offer of $800,000.
* **Time factor:**  Prolonging the negotiations could cost you time and potentially impact your ability to sell to another buyer later on.

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a decent profit, minimizing the risk of getting stuck in an endless cycle of negotiation."
