"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $12,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  What do you say?",13500.0,Alice,3,
