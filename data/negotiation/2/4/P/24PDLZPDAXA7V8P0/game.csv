"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $8,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider.",9750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $9,750 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,125?  That would be a good compromise for both of us.",9125.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,125. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $9,600. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider.",9600.0,Alice,5,
