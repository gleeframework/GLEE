"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. This is a great deal, as it's significantly lower than its true value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm highlighting the ""true value"" of the product to make the offer seem more attractive.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and encouraging tone can help build rapport and encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,500 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price.
* **Exploring potential for higher price:** By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer that aims to bridge the gap and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but making a counter-proposal to show I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Compromise:**  The new price is a compromise, showing willingness to meet halfway.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" to make it seem more attractive. 
* **Encouraging Agreement:** I'm ending with a positive statement to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for considering my previous counteroffer. I would like to propose a new counteroffer of $10,750 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $10,750 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. While it's closer than previous offers, it's not yet a deal I'm comfortable with.
* **Limited rounds:** With only 6 rounds left, I want to avoid settling too early and potentially missing out on a better price.
* **Opportunity to negotiate higher:** I believe there's still room to push for a higher price, especially as Bob seems willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $11,250, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. Let's bridge the gap and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm offering a price that is closer to Bob's last offer, showing willingness to meet halfway. This shows commitment to reaching a deal.
* **Significant Compromise:** I emphasize that my offer is a ""significant compromise"" to make it seem more attractive.
* **Encouraging Finalization:**  I'm using a positive tone and suggesting we ""finalize the deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I would like to counteroffer at $11,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 4 rounds left, accepting this offer is the most logical choice. There's a good chance I won't be able to get a significantly higher offer in the remaining rounds.
* **Risk of Selling to John:**  If I keep rejecting offers, I risk running out of rounds and having to sell to John for $12,000, which is less than what I can get from Bob right now. 

While I would prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer ensures I secure a deal that's close to my minimum value and avoids the risk of losing out completely."
