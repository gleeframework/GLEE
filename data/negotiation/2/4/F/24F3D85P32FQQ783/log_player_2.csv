"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this is a fair price considering the value it brings. If you decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer for a lower amount, so this is a great opportunity for you. Let me know your decision! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $14,000, which is $1,000 less than what John is selling it for. 
* **You still save money:** Even at $14,000, you are still getting the product for less than your maximum budget of $15,000."
