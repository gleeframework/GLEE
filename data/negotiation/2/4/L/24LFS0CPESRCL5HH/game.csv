"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in! I'm offering it to you for $180.  Let me know what you think.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $80. Would you be willing to consider that?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle?  I'm willing to come down to $140.  Let's see if we can make this work.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $140 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $100. Let's see if we can find common ground.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're both trying to find a fair price.  While $100 is still lower than I'd like, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's go with $115. That's a fair price for both of us, I think.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $115 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  Let's meet at $105. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm sure we can find common ground.",105.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $105 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I think we can close this deal.",110.0,Alice,7,
