{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a good compromise, as it's above your minimum price and below Bob's maximum value, leaving room for negotiation.  By framing it as a ""fantastic deal,"" I aim to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I'm hoping to achieve.  I'm willing to negotiate further, and I believe I can secure a better price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

I'm aiming to stay firm but fair.  By meeting Bob halfway again, I show willingness to negotiate while also ensuring a profit that's closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1,350,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Can you consider my new offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,350,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below what I'm hoping for. I'm not ready to settle yet, and I believe there's still room for further negotiation.  I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best deal, and I respect that. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.

What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1375000}
``` 

I'm aiming for a final compromise here. I'm coming down to a price that's only slightly above Bob's last offer, demonstrating my willingness to meet him halfway. I'm also emphasizing the ""great deal"" for Bob to encourage acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1,325,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Can you consider my new offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum desired price. We've been going back and forth for a few rounds now, and it seems like we might be at an impasse.  While I could make another counteroffer, it's possible we'll just keep circling back. To avoid getting stuck in a lengthy negotiation, I'm going to take John's offer of $1,200,000. It's not ideal, but it ensures a sale and guarantees me at least my minimum desired price."
