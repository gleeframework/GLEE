"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,250,000? This price still offers you a good deal, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I'm aiming for. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. What do you think?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
