"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,300,000 is more than Bob's maximum budget, and he can get the product for less from John. It's also worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if a better price can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,250,000? This price still offers you a good deal, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,250,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he could get from John.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I'm aiming for. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're both committed to finding a solution. How about $1,200,000? This is my absolute minimum, and it reflects the true value of the product. I believe this price is fair for both of us. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  At this point, Alice has offered Bob the product at his maximum budget, and it's the same price he can get it from John. There is no advantage to rejecting this offer and continuing negotiations."
