This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to get a good price.  I also included a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is still a good profit, I believe I can get closer to my target of $1,200,000 by continuing to negotiate.  I'm going to counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above Bob's."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,080,000 is still above my minimum, I'm not happy with the price yet. I'm going to counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I still think $1,100,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,090,000. Can you consider that?

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still not my ideal price, it's very close and it's getting late in the negotiation.  I don't want to risk losing the deal completely and ending up with the lower price from John."
