"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I would like to accommodate your budget, I must maintain a fair valuation for our product. I am proposing to reconsider my previous offer at $850,000. This still represents a significant discount from its true value, but I believe it strikes a balance between our interests. I hope this proposal is more acceptable to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?  I feel that's a fair price for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,4,
