Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive first opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm asking for a price of $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. Please let me know your decision, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start higher to explore Bob's willingness to pay a premium.
* **Justification:** The message subtly highlights the product's ""value"" and ""potential"" without being overly specific, leaving room for Bob to justify the higher price in his own mind.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a subtle sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you knew Bob was highly price-sensitive, you might adjust the offer slightly lower. 
* **Negotiation Margin:** This offer leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. You can always go down, but you can't go up from your initial offer."
