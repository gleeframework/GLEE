"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1100000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me, and still gives you a good profit margin. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1080000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,3,
