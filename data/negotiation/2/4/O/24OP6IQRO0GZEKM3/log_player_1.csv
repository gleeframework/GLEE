"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product for $110. It's worth a lot more to me, but I'm willing to make a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85 right now. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum of $100. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $95? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to what I need. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $90.  Let's split the difference and finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $90 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $90 just isn't enough for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $92.50.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a lower price.  How about $91?  It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a final agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While it's still a little below my minimum, it's getting close and I'm worried about running out of time.  It's better to get $91 than risk selling to John for $100 and potentially getting a better offer from Bob in a later round."
