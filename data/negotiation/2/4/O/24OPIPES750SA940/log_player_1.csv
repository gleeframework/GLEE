Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, considering the product's value to you is $10000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $12,000 is still a bit low for me."

Bob's offer:

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer more, $12,500 is a good price, and it's getting close to my minimum.  It's also a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to both of us."
