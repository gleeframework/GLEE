"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($80) but significantly below my minimum acceptable price ($120).  This gives Bob room to negotiate while still leaving me with a profit.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves room for both Bob and me to make counteroffers, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price within the 10 rounds.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me leverage. If the negotiation with Bob fails, I have a guaranteed sale at my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Lowball Offer:** Bob's offer of $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting his offer allows me to control the negotiation and potentially push for a higher price. 
* **John's Guarantee:**  While $80 is better than nothing, I have John as a guaranteed buyer for $120, so I'm not desperate to accept a low offer.

**Next Step:** In the next round, I will counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $80 is a bit too low for me right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $95?  It's still a great deal for you, and I'd be happy to make it work."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm counteroffering with $95, which is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Middle Ground:** This price is close to the middle of our respective perceived values, potentially making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting his initial offer, I've shown I'm not desperate to sell, and I'm still holding onto my fallback option of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $90. Would you be willing to meet me at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close But Not Enough:**  While $90 is closer to my minimum price of $120, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get.  
* **Continuing Negotiation:**  I have 6 rounds left. By rejecting his offer, I can continue to push for a higher price and potentially get closer to my desired outcome.
* **John's Guarantee:** As I have John as a guaranteed buyer for $120, there's no immediate need to settle for a lower price.

**Next Step:**  In the next round, I will counteroffer with a price slightly above Bob's $90 offer, keeping in mind that I have John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  $90 is closer, but I'm still looking for a bit more.  How about we compromise at $93? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 93}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** My counteroffer of $93 is a small increase from Bob's last offer of $90. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise and shows that I am taking his position seriously.
* **Towards My Goal:** $93 is still significantly closer to my desired price of $120. By gradually increasing the price, I am moving closer to my target while still being flexible.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I still have John as a guaranteed buyer for $120, which gives me the confidence to hold out for a price I am comfortable with. 

This approach aims to keep the negotiation moving forward while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a bit more, but I'm really not comfortable going above $90. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** We're at a stalemate. Bob has been insistent on $90, and I'm not willing to go below my minimum of $120. 
* **Time Constraint:** With only 4 rounds remaining, there's not enough time to negotiate further and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John's Guarantee:**  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum desired price of $120, which is more than what I'd get from Bob at this point.

**Conclusion:**  Although I'd prefer to get a higher price, it's more beneficial to take the guaranteed $120 from John than to risk losing more time and potentially getting a lower price from Bob."
