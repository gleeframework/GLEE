{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and is potentially attractive to Bob as it's still less than what he values the product at."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is important to you, but based on my budget, I am willing to pay up to $9,500 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still below it. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from my desired price.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  I'm confident this product will be worth it to you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our values. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is now at my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer more, it's a fair compromise and avoids the risk of further negotiation.  Accepting his offer is the best strategy at this point."
