"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $1,400,000.**  This is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **John's price is $1,500,000.** This is your maximum budget, but Alice is offering a better price. 

Therefore, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer to save $100,000."
