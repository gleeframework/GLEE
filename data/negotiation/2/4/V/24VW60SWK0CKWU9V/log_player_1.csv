Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point. I'm aiming for a price higher than my minimum value, but I'm also leaving room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I can adjust the price based on his counteroffer and how much I'm willing to go down to secure a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $70 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to go down a bit, but $70 is a bit too low for me.  How about $85? That's a fair compromise, and we can both be happy."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $78? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $78 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go below my minimum. Since John is willing to pay $80, I'll sell to him and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
