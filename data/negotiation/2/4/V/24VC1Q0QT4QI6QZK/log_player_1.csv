"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's a great deal for you as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $13,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $12,000. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer or if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below my minimum of $12,000, but it's getting closer. I want to see if I can push for a higher price before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $14,000. This is still a good deal for you as the product is worth $15,000 to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 14000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still interested in the product, but I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13,800. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I believe this price is fair considering the product's worth to me is $12,000. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer or if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still a bit lower. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can push for a price closer to $14,000.  It's worth risking a few more rounds to see if I can get a better price, especially since it's still more profitable for me than selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're working within a budget. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,900? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my target price. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 13900} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13,700. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $12,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is getting closer to my minimum but still below it. With only 4 rounds left, I need to prioritize making a profit.  While I'd like to reach a higher price, selling to John ensures a profit of $1,000. It's not ideal, but it's the safest option given the remaining time and Bob's unwillingness to budge significantly."
