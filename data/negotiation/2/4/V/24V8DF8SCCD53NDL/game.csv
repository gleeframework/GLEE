"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1100000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my needs and the value I see in it. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $900000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950000. This is a fair price considering the value I see in the product and the negotiations we've had so far. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $925000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I'm very close to my limit. Let me know what you think.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're close to your budget limit, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $925000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $975000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value of the product. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,
