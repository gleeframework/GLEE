"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me.  How about $140? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $140 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $155? That's a fair price for both of us.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $155 is still a bit too much for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $152.50?  That seems like a fair compromise.",152.5,Bob,4,
