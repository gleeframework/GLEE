Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $80 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  Could you meet me halfway at $140?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you be willing to go down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While ideally, I'd like to get closer to $140, accepting Bob's offer of $100 is the best move at this point. Here's why:

* **Meeting Bob's Value:** $100 is the maximum Bob is willing to pay. Pushing further will likely result in him walking away. 
* **Better Than Minimum:**  $100 is still a $50 profit over my minimum acceptable price.
* **Time Value:**  Negotiations take time.  Accepting now guarantees the sale and prevents me from potentially losing both Bob and John's offers."
