"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's important to negotiate to try and get a price closer to your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product but $120 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with an offer significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is polite and expresses continued interest, but clearly states that the initial price is unacceptable. 
* **Aiming for Savings:** While our maximum is $80, aiming for $60 could lead to a final price somewhere in between, maximizing potential savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I can offer you the product for $90. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice moved closer to our budget, $90 is still higher than both our target price ($60) and our maximum ($80). 
* **Alice is Negotiable:**  The fact that Alice countered instead of rejecting outright suggests she's willing to negotiate further. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a risk Alice won't go much lower, but the potential savings of getting closer to $80 or below outweigh the security of buying from John right now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $90 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $70. Would that be possible?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference (Almost):** This counteroffer meets Alice roughly halfway between her last offer ($90) and our previous offer ($60). It shows a willingness to compromise but holds firm to seeking a significant discount.
* **Nearing the Walk-Away Point:** Offering $70 puts us within $10 of our John backup plan. This signals to Alice that we're serious about the price and getting close to our limit. 
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:**  Continuing to express appreciation and use a collaborative tone encourages Alice to keep negotiating rather than walking away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $70 is still a bit lower than my minimum, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $85. It's a fair price, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** $85 is only $5 over our absolute maximum budget, and it's a reasonable compromise considering Alice's starting point.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:** Pushing further could alienate Alice, leading her to break off negotiations. We might end up having to buy from John anyway, losing the opportunity for any savings. 
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns. Accepting now saves time and secures the product."
