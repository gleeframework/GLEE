"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm hoping we can make a deal. My initial offer is $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $20,000 is far beyond my budget of $8,000.  It's worth rejecting and negotiating a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $20,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is limited. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget limitations, but $8,000 is significantly below the value of this product. I could come down to $18,000.  This is a very fair price and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is still too high for me. While it's a reduction, it's not enough to make it worthwhile. I'll continue to negotiate and see if I can get closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still outside my budget. I'm confident this product is valuable, but I can only offer $10,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. Let's do this, I'll come down to $16,000, but that's my final offer.  This is a significant discount and a deal you won't regret. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered the price to $16,000, it's still above my budget.  I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if I can get a lower price. There's still some room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your coming down on the price, but $16,000 is still too high for me.  I'm committed to finding a deal that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  This is a fair offer considering the value of the product and my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. I can see you're serious about this purchase. How about we split the difference and settle at $14,000?  This is my absolute best offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still above my budget. While we're getting closer, I'm not comfortable going any higher.  I've already used several rounds of negotiation, and I'm concerned that I won't be able to get a lower price.  Given the risk of not reaching a deal, I'm going to go ahead and purchase the product from John for $8,000. This guarantees that I get the product within my budget."
