"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm hoping we can make a deal. My initial offer is $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $20,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is limited. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget limitations, but $8,000 is significantly below the value of this product. I could come down to $18,000.  This is a very fair price and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still outside my budget. I'm confident this product is valuable, but I can only offer $10,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. Let's do this, I'll come down to $16,000, but that's my final offer.  This is a significant discount and a deal you won't regret.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your coming down on the price, but $16,000 is still too high for me.  I'm committed to finding a deal that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  This is a fair offer considering the value of the product and my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I can see you're serious about this purchase. How about we split the difference and settle at $14,000?  This is my absolute best offer.",14000.0,Alice,7,
