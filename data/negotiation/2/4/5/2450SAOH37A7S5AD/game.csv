"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is outside my budget. Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $8,500. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still above what I can realistically afford. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $9,500. This is a fair compromise given my budget and the value of the product.",9500.0,Bob,4,
