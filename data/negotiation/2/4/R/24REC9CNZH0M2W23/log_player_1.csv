Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives room for negotiation without immediately jeopardizing the deal.
* **Friendly Tone:** The message is polite and open to discussion, encouraging Bob to engage in a productive negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:** I highlight the value of the product to both of us, making it clear that this is a mutually beneficial deal. 
* **John as Backup:** The presence of John, who is willing to pay my minimum price, gives me a strong fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,350,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with what you're willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).** 
* **I have a strong backup option with John.** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired profit.
* **Rejecting the offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially close the gap.** By rejecting, I maintain control of the negotiation and can explore if I can push Bob closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,350,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $1,450,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but not too far from my initial position. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate.
* **Highlighting value again:** I reiterate the product's worth, subtly reminding Bob of its value and my justification for the price. 
* **Seeking common ground:** The message focuses on finding a solution that works for both of us, encouraging a positive and cooperative negotiation.
* **John as leverage (implied):** By not immediately accepting Bob's offer, I'm subtly implying that I have other options available, creating a sense of urgency."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I've reviewed it carefully, and while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, I must respectfully decline. My maximum budget remains at $1,350,000. I hope this helps us move closer to finding a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has been firm at $1,350,000, which is below my minimum acceptable price. Further negotiations seem unlikely to yield a better result for me.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer guarantees me my minimum desired profit of $1,500,000. There's no need to risk further negotiation with Bob. 
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing negotiations could drag on, potentially costing me time and opportunity.  It's more efficient to accept John's offer and secure the deal."
