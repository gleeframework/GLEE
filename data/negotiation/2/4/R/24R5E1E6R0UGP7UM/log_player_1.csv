Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  Let me know what you think, and we can certainly discuss."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value,"" Alice subtly hints at the product's worth without revealing her absolute bottom line.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message explicitly invites Bob to discuss the price, signaling flexibility and increasing the chances of striking a deal.

**Important Note:** Alice has a strong fallback position with John willing to pay $12,000. This knowledge empowers her to be firm in her negotiation with Bob."
