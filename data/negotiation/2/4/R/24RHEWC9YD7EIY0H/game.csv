"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $12500 is below my desired price, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $13500? It's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let me know what you think!",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $13000.
