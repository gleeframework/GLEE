"Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the price you are willing to pay from John. It's worth trying to negotiate a better price with Alice. There's a chance she's willing to go higher, and you could potentially save a significant amount of money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a significant counteroffer, lowering the price by 40%. While it's a risky move, it's worth trying to push Alice towards a lower price.  If she rejects it, you can always increase your offer slightly in the next round. This strategy aims to quickly gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially secure a much lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows me to continue trying to secure a lower price.  I can make another counteroffer, potentially even closer to my initial offer, and see if Alice is willing to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but am still pushing for a lower price. It's a balanced approach that might lead to a quicker agreement or provide more information on Alice's negotiating range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $450,000 is still significantly lower than John's price of $1,000,000. While I could continue negotiating, the potential savings from further negotiation are becoming smaller. Accepting the offer ensures a lower price and avoids the risk of Alice walking away entirely or  getting stuck with John's much higher price."
