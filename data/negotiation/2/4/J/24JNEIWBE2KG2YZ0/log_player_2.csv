{""product_price"": 900000}
```

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer, but it's still above Bob's desired price.  At this point, the risk of further negotiation is too high. Bob has already made multiple counteroffers, and Alice is showing she's unwilling to budge significantly.  Buying from John guarantees Bob the product for his maximum budget, saving him potential further losses and negotiation time."
