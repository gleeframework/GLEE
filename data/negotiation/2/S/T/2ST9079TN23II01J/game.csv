"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need it to be much closer to my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but $12,000 is still too far from what I have in mind.  How about we try $7,500?  That's a significant move on my part.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price, Bob. However, $7,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time at $10,500. I believe this price is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
