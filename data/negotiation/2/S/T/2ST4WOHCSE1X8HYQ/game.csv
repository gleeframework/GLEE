"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me at the moment.  I'd be willing to offer $1,000,000 as a starting point. I believe this is a fair offer considering its value in the current market.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm glad you're willing to make an offer. However, I'm not comfortable with the price of $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $1,300,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, taking into account the value you've placed on the product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be completely transparent, I have a budget I need to stick to. I can go up to $1,100,000.  That's a firm offer from my side.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you have a budget constraint, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,100,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make another concession. My counteroffer is $1,200,000. This is as close as I can get to meeting your budget while still getting a fair price for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
