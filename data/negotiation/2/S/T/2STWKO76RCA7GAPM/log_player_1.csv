Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing fairness to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Openness:** I'm inviting Bob to respond with his thoughts, allowing for a smoother negotiation process. 

**Note:**  This offer aims to find a middle ground while keeping in mind my minimum price of $15,000 (which I can always fall back on by selling to John)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $10,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Even though Bob is unwilling to pay more than $10,000 right now, I believe there's still room for negotiation. There are 8 more rounds to explore a middle ground.
* **Selling to John:**  While selling to John for $15,000 is tempting, I'm not ready to give up on Bob yet. I'll use the next round to make a counteroffer that might be more appealing to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I can't go down to $10,000, I'm willing to compromise. How about $11,500? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value, and it's closer to my asking price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget limitations and expressing my willingness to compromise.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, trying to justify a price higher than his initial offer.
* **Middle Ground:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Collaborative Tone:** I'm using phrases like ""find a solution"" to emphasize a collaborative approach and encourage further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $11,000. I hope this meets somewhere in between our expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to my minimum price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Exhausted:**  We've already gone through three rounds of negotiation, and it's unlikely that Bob will significantly increase his offer. 
* **Time Constraint:** I have 6 rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing this deal completely. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit for me. 

While selling to John for $15,000 would be ideal, accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and minimizes the risk of ending up with no deal at all."
