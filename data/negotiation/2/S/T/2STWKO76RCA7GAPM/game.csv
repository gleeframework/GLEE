"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I can't go down to $10,000, I'm willing to compromise. How about $11,500? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value, and it's closer to my asking price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,
