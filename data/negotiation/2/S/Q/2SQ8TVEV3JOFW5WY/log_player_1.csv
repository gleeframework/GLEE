Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $1,000,000 because you have a guaranteed sale at that price from John.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $200,000 surplus to split.
* **One-Shot Deal:** This is a single negotiation. If Bob rejects your offer, you go with your fallback option (John).

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal.  Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 leaves little incentive for Bob.  

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and exclusivity.
* **Price:** $1,150,000 gives Bob a $50,000 discount (enough to be enticing) while giving you a $150,000 profit above your minimum.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might lower the price slightly to increase your chances of acceptance.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, a more generous offer might be strategic, even if it means slightly less profit.

**This offer balances profit maximization with a strong likelihood of acceptance. Good luck with your negotiation!**"
