"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let's meet in the middle.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $775,000 for the product. Can you meet me halfway again?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but $775,000 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $800,000? This price is fair for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal without further delay.",800000.0,Alice,5,
