I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me, leaving room for negotiation.  This initial offer sets a strong starting point while leaving room for negotiation."

Round 2

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 825000}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my acceptable price. I want to see if I can squeeze out a little more before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but $775,000 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $800,000? This price is fair for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal without further delay."", ""product_price"": 800000}
