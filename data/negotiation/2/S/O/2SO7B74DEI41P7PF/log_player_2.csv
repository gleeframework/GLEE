Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer takes the average of Alice's offer ($11,250) and your previous offer ($10,500), showing you're committed to finding a middle ground.

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go to $10,900 as a final compromise.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Concession:** Alice has finally met your counteroffer of $10,900, which is a good price for you. 
* **Finality:** She has declared this her ""absolute final offer,"" meaning further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better price.
* **Time Pressure:** You're in the 9th round, leaving little room for further negotiation. While you could try one more counteroffer, there's a risk of losing the deal altogether.
