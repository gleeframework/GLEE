"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value and quality, we believe it's worth $120 to you. Considering this, my initial offer is $100 for the product. I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can potentially get a better deal by negotiating further. You value the product at $120, and Alice's offer is at $100. There's room for a counteroffer that would be more beneficial to you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm hoping to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product.  This is still a good deal for you, as you value it at $80. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 90}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. After considering your offer, I am willing to accept $95 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both the value you place on the item and the price I need to recover my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $95, which is still a better deal than buying from John for $120.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might walk away or increase her price.  Accepting her offer ensures you get the product for a price that is within your budget and is still a good deal."
