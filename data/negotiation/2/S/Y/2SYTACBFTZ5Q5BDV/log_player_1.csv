Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

I'm starting with a price of $10,000.  This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation, but it's also a price that I'm comfortable with. 

I'm hoping Bob will be interested in the product and will be willing to pay a good price. However, I'm also prepared to walk away if he's not willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the sale to John isn't worth it for a potential gain of only $500."
