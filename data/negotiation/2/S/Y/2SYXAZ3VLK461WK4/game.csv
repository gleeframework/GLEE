"Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product I'm offering for sale. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. I'm asking $15000 for it. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $10000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $12500? This would allow us to both get a good deal.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $12500 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from $10000 to $12500, so I'll offer $11000. Can we meet in the middle at $11250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. $11250 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and meet at $11500? It's a fair price for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've already offered $11000, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. Can you meet me at $11000?",11000.0,Bob,6,
