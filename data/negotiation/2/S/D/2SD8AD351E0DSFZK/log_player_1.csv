Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'll counteroffer to maintain a higher price point."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective, $1,200,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is the maximum I can go. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to see some more flexibility from your end. I'm offering $1,250,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a higher price.  While I appreciate Bob's willingness to move closer to my asking price,  $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable threshold. I'll counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."

{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  To make this deal work, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,275,000.

While Bob is coming closer to my minimum threshold, I'm not ready to accept this offer. There's still room for us to negotiate a price that's more beneficial to both of us.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 8
Bob's offer:

We're getting very close to my minimum threshold, but it's risky to keep negotiating. If I keep rejecting, Bob may simply walk away, and I'm already within striking distance of my minimum acceptable price with John.  It's time to take the sure thing."
