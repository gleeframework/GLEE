Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. This allows for potential compromise while still trying to maximize my profit.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for anything less than $1,500,000, as that's my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a higher price, aiming for a compromise closer to my desired $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

This counteroffer represents a compromise. I've reduced my initial price, but still aim for a profit closer to my desired value. I believe this offer is reasonable enough to entice Bob to accept while ensuring I receive a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  The risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob is that we may reach a stalemate or he may walk away entirely.  John is offering my minimum acceptable price and is a guaranteed sale. I will accept his offer and sell to John."
