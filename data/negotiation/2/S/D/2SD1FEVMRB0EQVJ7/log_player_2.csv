"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds immense value to me. This item is not just a possession; it's a symbol of excellence and craftsmanship. Given its significance to me, I am considering offering it to you at a special price. My proposal is to sell the product to you for $950,000. This offer is exclusive to you and represents a significant discount from its true worth. I believe this is a fair and advantageous proposition for both parties. I look forward to your positive response and the possibility of discussing the details further. Kind regards, Alice. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a discount from the product's true value, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000. It's more beneficial to reject Alice's offer and purchase the product from John for a lower price."
