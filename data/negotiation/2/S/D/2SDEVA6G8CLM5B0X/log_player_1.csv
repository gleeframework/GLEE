Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but not so high that it immediately feels unreasonable. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Leaving a bit of room for negotiation allows for a back and forth and potentially a better price for both of us.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encouraging, making Bob more likely to engage in the negotiation.

**Important Considerations:**

* **My Bottom Line:**  While I'd like to earn as much as possible, I need to remember my minimum is $15,000 from John. If I can't get at least that, I'll go with John.
* **Bob's Financial Situation:**  I don't have information about Bob's ability to pay. If he makes a low counteroffer, I may need to consider that.
* **Time Value:**  I need to balance the potential for a better price with the risk of wasting time with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $5,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even below Bob's own perceived value. 
* **Counteroffer is Necessary:**  I need to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  I won't accept a price that leaves me with such a significant loss. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll need to send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my bottom line, but still considering his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. $5,000 is a bit too low for me, but I appreciate you making an offer.  Let's try $9,000.  I'm willing to work with you to find a price that works for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still staying well above my minimum. 
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly and collaborative tone keeps the negotiation open and avoids a feeling of impasse.
* **Room for Flexibility:** I'm leaving room for further negotiation if Bob still considers this price too high. 

**Considerations:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:** This counteroffer has a higher chance of being accepted than my initial offer, but it's still a risk as it's below my ideal price.  
* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  I'll need to be ready to adjust my price further if Bob doesn't accept my counteroffer.
* **John's Offer:** I need to keep in mind that John's offer is still on the table if this negotiation fails."
