,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $20,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $12,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $20,000 is quite a ways from my bottom line.  Could you meet me somewhere in the middle, say around $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still more than I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's try to make this work.",14000.0,Bob,4,
