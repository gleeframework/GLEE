Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum value:** This ensures you still make a profit, and leaves room for potential counteroffers.

I'm aiming to find a price that both Bob and I are happy with. If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust accordingly, always keeping in mind that John is a potential buyer willing to pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is my best offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $12,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum.  

I'll need to find a price that's appealing enough to Bob to make him consider a higher offer, but also high enough for me to make a reasonable profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I understand your budget, but I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering $9,500, which is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not desperate to sell at his price."
