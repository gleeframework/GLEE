Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I understand your budget, but I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.
