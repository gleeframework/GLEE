"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product which I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it at $11,500. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $1,000 less than John's price:** This makes Alice's offer the better option for Bob. 
* **Further negotiation may be difficult:** It's possible Bob could get a lower price, but there's no guarantee. The risk of a longer negotiation could lead to a stalemate and force him to buy from John at a higher price.
* **$11,000 is still within Bob's budget:**  The price is below Bob's maximum of $12,000, so it's a financially acceptable outcome.

Given these factors, accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible decision."
