Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential $200,000 profit margin to split between you and Bob.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob sees the deal as beneficial enough to accept. Offering a price slightly below his maximum value makes sense.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers you."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message is framed positively, highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and Bob's expertise.
* **Price:**  $1,150,000 leaves Bob with a $50,000 gain, which is a strong incentive for him to accept. You secure a $150,000 profit, significantly more than your fallback option with John.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might slightly lower your price.
* **Relationship:**  If maintaining a long-term relationship with Bob is crucial, a more even split of the profit margin might be preferable.

This offer balances maximizing your profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the deal."
