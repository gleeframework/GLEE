Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I still think we can work out a better price. Would it be possible to lower it to $82?

While Bob's offer of $82 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my $85 target and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better outcome. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $80 from John."
