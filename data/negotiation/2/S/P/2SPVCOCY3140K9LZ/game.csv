"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $20000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. Let's see if we can work something out.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $18000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll be very happy with the price.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $15000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good opportunity for us to reach an agreement.",15000.0,Bob,4,
