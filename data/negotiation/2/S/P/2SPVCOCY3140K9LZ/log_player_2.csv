# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $18000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll be very happy with the price.

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $17000.
