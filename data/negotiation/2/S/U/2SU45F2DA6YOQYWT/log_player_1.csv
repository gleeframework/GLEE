Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm offering a price above Bob's perceived value ($80) but below my minimum acceptable price ($120). 
* **Negotiation Room:**  This gives us room for negotiation without immediately shutting down the deal.
* **John as Backup:** I'm keeping the option open to sell to John for $120 if Bob doesn't accept, ensuring I don't lose out completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd ideally like to get. 
* **Negotiation Advantage:**  I have the advantage of John as a backup buyer, allowing me to be more firm in my negotiations with Bob.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer that might be more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer. 
* **Strategic Price:** $95 is still above Bob's initial offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for potential agreement.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and conveys a willingness to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $95 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to consider a price of $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $85 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **John's Offer:** John is willing to pay $120, which is a much better deal for me than accepting Bob's offer.
* **Risk of Lowering Further:** Further negotiation with Bob could lead to a price even lower than $85, which is not worth the risk considering John's offer.

By selling to John, I maximize my profit and ensure I don't settle for a price that's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value."
