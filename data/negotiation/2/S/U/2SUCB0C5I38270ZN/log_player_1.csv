Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

This offer is a starting point. It's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation and a potential deal.  It's also significantly lower than the value to Alice, allowing her to gain a good profit but not risking losing the sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice should reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to her desired price than his initial offer, it's still significantly lower than what she's willing to accept. There's still room for negotiation and she can try to get closer to her desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

This counteroffer represents a compromise. It's lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than Bob's latest offer. It shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

At this point, the negotiations have gone on for a while, and Bob's offers are still too low for Alice. It's getting closer to the value Bob is willing to pay but it's still below Alice's minimum.  She's better off selling to John and securing a guaranteed profit."
