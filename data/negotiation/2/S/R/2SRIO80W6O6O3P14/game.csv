"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $1500000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Considering its unique features and potential, I'm willing to come down to $1800000. This price still allows for a fair return on my investment, and I believe it's a strong value proposition for you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
