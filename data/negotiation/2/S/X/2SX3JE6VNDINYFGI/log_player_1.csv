"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm offering it to you for $200. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $150. Would you be open to negotiating closer to that range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unwilling to go above his maximum perceived value of $150.  Since I have another buyer (John) willing to pay my minimum acceptable price, it makes the most sense to sell to John immediately.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Bob will be fruitful, and it introduces unnecessary risk."
