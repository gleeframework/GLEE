"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $115. This is a good starting point, as it's a fair price for both of us. It leaves room for negotiation if needed, but it's also significantly higher than my minimum price, ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's better than selling to John, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm countering with $110.  This is a slight decrease from my initial offer but still above my minimum price and closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that we can both agree on."
