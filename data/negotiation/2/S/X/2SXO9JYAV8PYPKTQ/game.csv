,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree that the product is valuable, but that price is a bit too high for my budget. How about we bring it down to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. This product offers unique advantages and will bring you substantial returns. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we split the difference again and settle on $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
