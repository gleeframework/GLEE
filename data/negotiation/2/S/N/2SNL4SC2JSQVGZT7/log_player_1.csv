Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer, followed by the offer itself:

**Strategy:**

* **Maximum Potential:** Alice knows she can get $1,500,000 from John, so that's her fallback and sets the highest possible price she should offer to Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.  Alice needs to offer a price lower than this for Bob to accept.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** Alice shouldn't start at Bob's maximum. Offering a price slightly below gives room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal and potentially counter-offer.

**Offer:**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a significant value proposition for you."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Why this offer?**

* **Attractive to Bob:** The price is significantly lower than his valuation, making it a tempting deal.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's space for Bob to negotiate, potentially increasing the final price Alice receives.
* **Protects Alice's Minimum:** Even if Bob counter-offers, Alice has a strong position to negotiate up, knowing she has John as a guaranteed buyer."
