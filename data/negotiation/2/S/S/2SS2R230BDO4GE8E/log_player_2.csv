Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like your thinking, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. What do you think?

``` 

While it's not ideal to spend $120, it's better than getting stuck in a loop with Alice and potentially ending up paying $110 when a $120 alternative exists."
