"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $900,000 is a bit high for me.  Could you do $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $700,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something a bit lower. Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $800,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product offers. If you're still interested, I'd be happy to move forward with the sale at this price. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",800000.0,Alice,5,,
