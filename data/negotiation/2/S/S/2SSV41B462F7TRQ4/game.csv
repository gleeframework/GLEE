"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly unique product.  Its value is significant, and I believe it will be a highly worthwhile investment for you.  To kick off our negotiation, I'd like to start with an initial offer of $1,800,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial outcome.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe the product is valuable, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need some wiggle room.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your offer, the product's intrinsic value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,700,000. This revised offer reflects a fair balance between its worth and our shared goal of reaching an agreement.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,550,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth and the market value.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground.  However, the $1,550,000 offer doesn't reflect the true value this product holds. I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us.  To demonstrate my commitment, I'm willing to accept $1,625,000.  This is a significant concession, and I believe it represents a fair and reasonable compromise.",1625000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,575,000, but I need to be honest with you, I'm getting close to my limit. I'm hoping we can find a way to meet in the middle.",1575000.0,Bob,6,
