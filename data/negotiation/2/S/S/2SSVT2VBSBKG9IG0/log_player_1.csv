"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a unique piece with a lot of value, and I think it would be a great asset for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not desperate to sell immediately.  There's still potential to get closer to my desired price. I'll try to negotiate with Bob further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, but it reflects my desire to work with you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the discount, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $11000? I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired $12,000. I'm not in a rush to sell, so I'll see if I can negotiate a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and go with $11,500? This is a good compromise that allows both of us to get a fair deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $11000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is only $500 below my last counteroffer of $11,500. We're nearing a deal, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John for just $500.  It's a reasonable compromise, and I can live with that price."
