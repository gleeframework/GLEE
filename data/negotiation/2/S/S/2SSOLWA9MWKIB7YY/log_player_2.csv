"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,550,000. It's a fantastic deal, as you know the product is worth $1,500,000 to you.  Let me know your decision. I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to work with you if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. While Alice is offering a good deal, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to secure the product for his budget from John."
