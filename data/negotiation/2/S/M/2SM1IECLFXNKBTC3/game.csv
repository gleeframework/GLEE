"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to buy this product. However, $950000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $850000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $920000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you need a fair price, Alice.  $920000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $880000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's try to close the deal here.",880000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  However, $900000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $890000, which is a fair compromise considering our previous discussions.  Let's work together to close this deal.",890000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm glad we're making progress, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $895000? It's a small bump from your last offer, but I think it's worth it to get this deal done.",895000.0,Alice,7,
