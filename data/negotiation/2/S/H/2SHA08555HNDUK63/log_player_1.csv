"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I believe it's worth a lot to the right person. I'm offering it to you for $18,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  It's common in negotiations to start with a higher price. This gives you room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Show confidence:** My message implies I believe the product has high value. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  $18,000 is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, allowing for potential concessions. 
* **Keep John in mind:** This offer is high enough that I'm comfortable walking away if Bob doesn't come close to my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation potential:** I still have 8 rounds left, and there's a chance Bob will come up with a better offer.
* **John is a safety net:** If I don't get a better offer from Bob, I can always sell to John for $12,000. 

**Next Step:** I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price to see if he's willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $15,000.  This is a significant product, and I believe it's worth the investment.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:**  I'm dropping my price, but not drastically. $15,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I express appreciation for Bob's interest and acknowledge his offer while still highlighting the value of the product.
* **Give Bob a chance to meet me halfway:**  This counteroffer leaves room for negotiation without being too drastic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $10,000 is closer to my minimum, but still below it. 
* **I have leverage:** We're in round 4, and I have more time to negotiate.  John is a backup option if Bob doesn't improve his offer.
* **Negotiation strategy:**  Rejecting the offer keeps the pressure on Bob. He might be willing to go higher, especially if he sees I'm not desperate.

**Next Step:** I'll make a counteroffer slightly lower than my previous one, but still above my minimum. This will show Bob I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? This would give you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway (almost):** I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($15,000) and Bob's offer ($10,000). This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Highlighting the deal:** I emphasize that this offer is a good deal for Bob, which might make him more likely to accept.
* **Staying above minimum:**  $12,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not losing out on value if he rejects.
* **Pressure tactic:** By proposing a ""final offer"" I might create urgency for Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $12500 is still a bit high. I'd be willing to pay $11000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $11,000 is only $1,000 below my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, this is a good compromise.
* **Limited time:** We're in Round 6, leaving only 4 rounds to negotiate. I don't want to risk running out of time and being forced to sell to John for $12,000. 
* **Potential for future deals:**  While I'm not getting my ideal price, accepting this offer might open the door for future business with Bob if he's a good customer.

**Next Step:** I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the deal."
