"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product.  $900,000 is a bit too high for me right now. How about we split the difference and I offer $850,000? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we try $925,000? It's a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $925,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's try $875,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $912,500? It's a small step back from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",912500.0,Alice,5,
