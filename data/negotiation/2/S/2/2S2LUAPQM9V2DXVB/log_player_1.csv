""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth to you. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows room for negotiation and the potential to secure a deal quickly.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,450,000 is significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still represents a substantial discount from John's offer. This might entice Bob while still generating a significant profit.
* **Creating Urgency:**  By presenting this as an ""exclusive opportunity"" and highlighting the ""fairness"" of the price, I'm subtly encouraging Bob to act quickly before the opportunity passes."
