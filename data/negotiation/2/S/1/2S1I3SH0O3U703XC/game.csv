"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that starting price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but  I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is significantly below the product's true value. To find common ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but I still need this price to come down a bit more.  Would you consider $925,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",925000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground.  I've considered your offer carefully, and I'm willing to make one final move.  I can let go of the product for $1,190,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's a very fair offer given the product's value.  Please let me know your decision.",1190000.0,Alice,7,
