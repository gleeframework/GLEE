"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While the product is impressive, the price point is a little high for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $12,000?  That's a fair deal for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're close to the price you're willing to pay, but I'm not quite ready to let it go for $12,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $12,800. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",12800.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I'm willing to come up slightly to $12,200. However, that's the best I can do.",12200.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $12,200, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,200 and my previous offer of $12,800. I'll offer it to you for $12,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",12500.0,Alice,7,
