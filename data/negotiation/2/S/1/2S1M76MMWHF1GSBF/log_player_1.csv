"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $18,000 for it, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Friendly approach:** I'm being friendly and open to discussion to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value proposition:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob without revealing my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $18,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $12,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  I believe there's still room for a higher price, as Bob is interested in the product. 
* **Exploring better options:** I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget constraints, $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a fair price considering the value this product offers.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlight the value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to reiterate why the price is justified. 
* **Open-ended question:**  I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation by asking what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $14,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Close to the John deal:**  I'm very close to my minimum price, but John is willing to pay more.
* **Exploring further negotiation:** I'll counteroffer again to see if Bob is willing to come up further, but I'm prepared to accept John's offer if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. $14,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $15,000, which is my absolute minimum.  It's a fair price considering the value this product brings. Let me know if you're willing to meet me there."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This is my absolute minimum price, and I'm letting Bob know this is my final offer.
* **Clear and concise:** The message is straightforward and focuses on the price, avoiding unnecessary chit-chat.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Call to action:**  I'm asking for a definitive answer to push the negotiation forward.

**If Bob rejects this offer, I'll go ahead and sell the product to John for $15,000.**"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $15,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $13,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **John is willing to pay my minimum:**  I have a guaranteed offer from John for my minimum price.
* **Limited time:**  There are only four rounds left, and I'm unlikely to get a better offer from Bob within that timeframe.

I'm going to take the guaranteed deal with John to secure my minimum desired price and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
