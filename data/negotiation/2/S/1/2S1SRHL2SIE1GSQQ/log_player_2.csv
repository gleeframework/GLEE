"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100.  It's a great deal, as it's worth much more to you than that! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. There's plenty of room to negotiate down towards a price closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a little steep for me. How about $70?"",
 ""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

This counteroffer starts the negotiation significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room to negotiate upwards. It aims to understand how flexible Alice is willing to be on the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down considerably in price, and $85 is a good deal, well within the acceptable price range and leaving a decent saving. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better result."
