Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $14,000. I think it could be very valuable for you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you aim to get as close to that as possible from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $14,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's interested, but still ensures a significant profit for you.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes a ""special price"" to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal, potentially increasing his willingness to accept."
