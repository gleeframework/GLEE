"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $8500. It's worth every penny, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money. While the product is worth $8,000 to him, Alice's offer of $8,500 is higher than his maximum budget.  He can get the same product from John for $8,000, which is within his budget.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer is the best strategy for Bob."
