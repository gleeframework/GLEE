"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm aiming for. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,250.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,100. This would be a good compromise for both of us and get us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 9100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,100. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I get a decent profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,300. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,300

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer, but you're running out of rounds. You're unlikely to get her down to your target price. It's better to buy from John and save yourself the time and potential frustration of further negotiation."
