"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your desire to stay within budget, however,  $750,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I could be persuaded to part with it for $900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the true value of what's on offer.",900000.0,Alice,3,
