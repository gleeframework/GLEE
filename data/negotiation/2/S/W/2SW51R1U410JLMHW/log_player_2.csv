"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I'm confident you'll find it valuable, and I'm willing to make a fair deal. I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,100,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's significantly higher than Alice's value of the product ($800,000). There's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal and might incentivize Alice to lower her price closer to her perceived value."
