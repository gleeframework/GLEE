Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $10,500, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to try to negotiate with Bob further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still a little higher than that.  How about $11,000? That's still a good deal for you, considering it's worth $12,000 to you. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,250. That's a bit closer to what I'm comfortable with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price, and I'm not ready to sell to John for $10,000 yet.  There are still a few rounds left, and I believe I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $10,250 is still quite a bit below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - how about $10,750? I'm willing to come down a little further to meet you halfway."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $10,750. I'd be willing to consider $10,500, which is a fair price for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. Although it's still a bit lower than I hoped for,  we're getting close to a deal.  With only a few rounds left, it's not worth risking losing the sale completely by rejecting his offer.  $10,500 is still better than selling to John for $10,000."
