,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I acknowledge your budget constraints,  $1200000 doesn't fully reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1400000. This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. Given the current market conditions and the value I place on this product, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1300000.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer. While I appreciate your persistence, $1300000 still falls short of the value I know this product holds.  Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to accept $1350000. This price reflects both our needs and the product's potential. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,5,
