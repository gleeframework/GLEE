Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's value:** Bob is willing to pay $15,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **My minimum:** I need to get at least $12,000.
* **John's offer:** John's offer of $12,000 gives me a safety net.

By offering $14,000, I'm aiming for a price that's:

* **Attractive to Bob:**  He gets a good deal compared to his perceived value.
* **Profitable for me:**  I earn more than my minimum and still get a decent price.

This offer balances the risk of Bob rejecting with the potential for a higher profit."
