"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate the value it holds, but my budget is limited to $150. Would it be possible for you to lower the price?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget limitations, but unfortunately $150 is just below my minimum asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $162.50?  I think it's a fair compromise considering we're both interested in making this deal happen.",162.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $162.50 price point. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to $150, perhaps $150 itself?",150.0,Bob,4,
