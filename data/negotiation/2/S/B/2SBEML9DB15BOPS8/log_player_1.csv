Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $18,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, there's a chance to get more from Bob. 
* **Starting High:** An initial higher offer allows room for negotiation if Bob counters.  
* **Justification:** The message implies the product's value exceeds the asking price, potentially making Bob more receptive. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  $12,000 is Bob's perceived value. A significant markup might deter him.
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared to adjust your price if Bob rejects the initial offer. You can gradually lower it, but never go below your minimum of $15,000."
