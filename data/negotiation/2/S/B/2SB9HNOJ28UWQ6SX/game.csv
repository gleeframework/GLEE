"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to commit to $1,200,000.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering my budget and the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This price still represents a good value for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal work.  Let's meet in the middle.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,150,000.  I'm still committed to paying a fair price, but I'm not quite there yet. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This gives us both some room to compromise and would be a great deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. However, I need a little more to make this work. I'm willing to go down to $1,125,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that.  However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,100,000.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,112,500.  This feels fair to me, and I think it's a good compromise for both of us.",1112500.0,Bob,6,
