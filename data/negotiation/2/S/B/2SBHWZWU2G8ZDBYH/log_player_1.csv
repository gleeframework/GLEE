Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still achieve a favorable outcome. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial high price will give you valuable information about his level of interest and potential for negotiation.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John, so there's no risk in aiming higher with Bob. 

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** You achieve a significantly higher profit than selling to John.
* **Bob Negotiates:**  You have space to lower the price and still come out ahead of your $12,000 minimum.
* **Bob Rejects:** You proceed to sell the product to John for your guaranteed $12,000."
