I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000.  This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation, but it's not so high that it's likely to be immediately rejected.  I'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not satisfied with it. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is still above my minimum but shows I'm willing to compromise a bit.  Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable price and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is higher than what John is offering. It's also closer to my desired price than my last counteroffer. I'm going to accept this offer and close the deal with Bob."
