"I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me at that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be compensated for the value of this product.  I'm prepared to offer it to you for $16,500. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from it. Let's see if we can make this work.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. Can you consider that price?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. $14,000 is closer to my bottom line, but I can't quite go that low.  Let's split the difference and see if we can agree on $15,500.  This way we both get a fair deal, and I can move this product along. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,500. Can you meet me at that price?",14500.0,Bob,6,
