"Alice, $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss a price of 12000? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it stays within my budget.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your point, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as 10000. How about we meet at 11500? It's a compromise that still gives me a decent profit, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",11500.0,Alice,5,
