"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to secure the product at a slightly lower price. Let's meet in the middle at $875000. This would be a fair compromise for both of us and allow us to close the deal quickly.",875000.0,Bob,4,
