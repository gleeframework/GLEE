"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also framing it as a good deal for Bob to encourage him to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my target price of $120.  I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also trying to get closer to my desired price. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $92.50 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $90? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to $120. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $90 is closer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. Let's try $95. This is a fair price, and it allows both of us to get a good deal. "", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering a slightly higher price than Bob's offer, but I'm still trying to meet him in the middle. I believe that $95 is a fair price that balances both our needs. I'm hoping this will be enough to get Bob to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $95. I'm willing to go up to $92, but no higher. Can we meet at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough call, as $92 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but it's getting close to my minimum. With only 4 rounds left, I'm worried about losing the deal with Bob altogether and being stuck with the $120 offer from John.  It's better to accept the slightly lower price and secure the sale."
