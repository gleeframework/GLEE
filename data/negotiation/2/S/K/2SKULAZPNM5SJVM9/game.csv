"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll really appreciate its value. I'm willing to part with it for $1,300,000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,300,000 is a bit high for me. How about we settle at $1,100,000? ",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1,220,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",1220000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the consideration.  I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I see the value in your product, $1,220,000 is still a bit beyond my budget.  Would you consider $1,150,000?  I feel that's a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,150,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $1,180,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. This is already a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",1180000.0,Alice,5,
