{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $8,500, which is still a good deal for him, and significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This counteroffer is calculated based on Alice's perceived value of the product ($8,000) and Bob's maximum budget ($10,000). This strategy aims to find a middle ground while still prioritizing saving money."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still potentially do better.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to try for a lower price. It's important to remember that John is always an option, but Bob is trying to save as much money as possible."

{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise while still keeping his goal of saving money.  $8,750 is a good middle ground, still less than Alice's latest offer, and closer to the price point where a deal could be struck."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price. While Bob would prefer a lower price, $8,900 is a good deal considering his maximum budget is $10,000.  Accepting the offer saves Bob money and closes the deal without risking further negotiation or potentially losing out to John."
