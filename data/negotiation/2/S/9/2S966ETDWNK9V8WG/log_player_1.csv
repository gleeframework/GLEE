"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This is a significant amount for me, as it's well above my minimum threshold of $8,000. However, it also leaves some room for negotiation, acknowledging that Bob values the product at $10,000. This should encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum threshold, I'm not willing to accept it just yet. I believe I can still get a better price, especially considering Bob's initial valuation of the product. By rejecting his offer, I can initiate another round of negotiation and potentially reach a price closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price from $9,500 to $9,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still keeping the price above my minimum threshold. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be attractive enough for Bob to consider, potentially leading to a deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still hesitant to accept.  The product is worth significantly more to Bob, and I believe there's still room for him to increase his offer.  I'll continue the negotiation process, aiming to reach a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8900}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price again to $8,900. This is getting close to Bob's last offer, showing him that I'm willing to compromise. However, I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price, as I believe he values the product at $10,000.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to entice Bob to accept."
