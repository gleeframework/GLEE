I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,500. This price is a good starting point because it's a significant amount more than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, and it leaves room for negotiation if necessary. I believe this price will be attractive to Bob while still allowing me to earn a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8700}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob at $8,700. This price is a compromise between my desired price and Bob's offer, and I believe it is still a fair price considering the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm running the risk of going back and forth with Bob indefinitely, potentially costing me time and effort without a guaranteed higher price.  It's best to take the guaranteed $8,000 from John and move on."
