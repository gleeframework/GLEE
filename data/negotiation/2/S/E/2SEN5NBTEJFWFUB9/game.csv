"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $150?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's close this deal!",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $150 is still above my budget. How about we split the difference and go with $125?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my means. Let's make this happen!",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm open to finding a solution, but $125 is still too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $137.50. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also acknowledging your budget. Let's make this deal happen!",137.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $137.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Let's try $120. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",120.0,Bob,6,
