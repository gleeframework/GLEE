Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $925,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

This is a good time to accept the offer. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You're buying the product for $925,000, saving $75,000 compared to John's offer.
* **Alice's Limit:**  Alice has indicated this is her lowest price. Pushing further might make her back out, leaving you to buy from John at a higher price. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Further negotiation might yield smaller and smaller concessions, making the effort less worthwhile."
