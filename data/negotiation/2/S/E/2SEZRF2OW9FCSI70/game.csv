"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $975,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $925,000.
