"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe could be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a significant discount considering its true value. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
