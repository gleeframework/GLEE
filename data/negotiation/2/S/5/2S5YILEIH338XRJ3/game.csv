"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. Let me know if you're interested in negotiating further.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to get at least $10500 for the product. Let's meet in the middle at $10000. It's still a good price for you, considering the value you place on it.",10000.0,Alice,3,
