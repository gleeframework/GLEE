"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11000.  It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $10000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $11,000 is more than Bob is willing to pay. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let me know if you're interested in negotiating further."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to get at least $10500 for the product. Let's meet in the middle at $10000. It's still a good price for you, considering the value you place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,000 is the same price as John's offer. While Bob could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that Alice will agree to a lower price, and doing so risks losing the product.  Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at Bob's maximum price point."
