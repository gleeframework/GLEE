"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm trying to stay within a certain budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,200? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be a good compromise for both of us.",9200.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,200 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,350?  This would give you a great deal, and it allows me to cover my costs.",9350.0,Alice,5,
