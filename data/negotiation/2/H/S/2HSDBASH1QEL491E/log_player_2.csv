Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but the product is worth significantly more than your offer. I could consider letting it go for $900,000. This feels like a fairer reflection of its value.

It's clear Alice won't go below $800,000. There's no point in continuing to negotiate, as John offers the same price without the hassle."
