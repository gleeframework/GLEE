Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, I can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. 
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, meaning there's a chance he might be willing to pay a premium to secure it.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, it leaves room for Bob to negotiate. This allows me to potentially meet somewhere in the middle while still exceeding my minimum sale price. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes I have no information about Bob's negotiation style or financial limitations. Depending on the context and any additional information, the offer price could be adjusted."
