"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a better price.  Given the product's value to me and your own stated value, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me to consider. However, I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This reflects a significant reduction from my initial offer and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Considering the value of the product to both of us, I'm offering $1,075,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects a compromise and allows us to both benefit from this transaction.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
