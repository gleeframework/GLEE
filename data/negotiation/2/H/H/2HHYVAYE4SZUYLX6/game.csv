"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $800,000 is a bit high for me at this point.  I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product. This is a significant amount considering its value to you, and I believe it's a good starting point for further negotiation. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was expecting a higher offer considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers. I'll counter with an offer of $1,200,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the product's worth to you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up slightly from my previous offer, but I can't go above $700,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away with a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'll meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll counter with an offer of $1,000,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the product's worth to you.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $800,000 for the product. This is a significant amount, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering your desired profit margin.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high.  I understand we both want a fair deal. Let's split the difference this time.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and it's a price that should allow you to make a profit. Let's make this happen.",900000.0,Bob,8,
