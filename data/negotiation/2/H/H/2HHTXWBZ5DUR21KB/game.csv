"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate it, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product. What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $140 is a bit too low for me. How about $155? It's still a good price for a product worth $150 to you.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $155 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $145. This is my final offer. ",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While $145 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference. How about $150?  That way, we both get a fair deal.",150.0,Alice,5,
