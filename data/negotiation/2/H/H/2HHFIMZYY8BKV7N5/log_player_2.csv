"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is better for Bob than John's offer of $15,000.  Even though Bob values the product at $15,000, getting it for $14,000 is a better deal."
