"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject the offer.  $900,000 is still too high. He can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice. It's also worth noting that Bob has a fallback option of buying from John, so there's no immediate pressure to accept Alice's initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a significant price reduction. This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum acceptable price. This counteroffer sets the stage for further negotiation."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  He can likely push for a lower price through further negotiation. There's no urgent need to accept yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```
