Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$110:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum ($100) but still leaving room for negotiation. This allows for some flexibility and potential for a profitable outcome.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and positive, trying to create a good rapport with Bob. I also highlight the potential value of the product for him. 

This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. I'm ready to counter his offers if necessary, but ultimately I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not afraid to walk away if I don't feel the price is fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $100. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept a price that undervalues my product.  Rejecting his offer allows me to try and get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $95? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$95:** This price is a compromise between my minimum of $100 and Bob's offer of $90. It shows a willingness to negotiate but still ensures I get a price that's worth my time. 
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's interest and reiterate the value he'll get at this price. I aim to create a sense of urgency and encourage him to accept the offer. 

This counteroffer attempts to find a middle ground while maintaining a firm stance on my minimum value.  I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $95 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum value of $100. While I could continue to negotiate, I'm not confident I'll be able to reach a price I'm comfortable with.  At this point, it's more advantageous to sell the product to John for $100. This guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
