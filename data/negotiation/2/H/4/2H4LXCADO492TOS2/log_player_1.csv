Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's maximum value:**  Bob is willing to pay up to $8,000.
* **Your minimum value:**  You are willing to sell for at least $15,000.
* **John's value:**  John is willing to pay $15,000, giving you a safety net.

By offering $14,000, you are:

* **Maximizing your potential profit:** You're getting significantly more than Bob's maximum value.
* **Minimizing the risk of losing the sale:**  The price is still within a reasonable range for Bob to consider, but it also leaves room for you to make a profit if he rejects it.

This offer gives you the best chance of getting a higher price without risking losing the sale completely."
