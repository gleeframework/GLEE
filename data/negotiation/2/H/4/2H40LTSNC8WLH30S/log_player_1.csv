{""message"": ""Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to you, and I believe we can find a price that benefits us both. Let's start with $1,000,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to $850,000 would be fair. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. I want to try and get closer to my target price.  I'll reject and send him a counter offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the value this product holds for you. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I want to make this work. How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is a good compromise and gets me closer to my target price.  Accepting it is the best option at this point."
