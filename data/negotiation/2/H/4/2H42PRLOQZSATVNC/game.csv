"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?  This would still give you a great price, and allow me to get closer to my desired price.  Let me know what you think.",10250.0,Alice,3,,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to find common ground here.  I'm willing to go down to $10,000, but that's my final offer.  If you're not comfortable with that price, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers.  It's up to you.",10000.0,Alice,5,,
