"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $20,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let's see if we can make this work.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value your offer, $12,000 is quite a bit below my bottom line.  Could you meet me halfway at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  This is my final offer before I explore other options.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price.  It seems we are getting close. How about we split the difference and make it $15,000? This is my final offer.",15000.0,Alice,5,
