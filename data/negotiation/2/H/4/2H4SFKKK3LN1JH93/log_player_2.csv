"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking $100 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. I have room to negotiate a lower price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a little steep for me, how about $85?"", 
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This gives me room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below my maximum budget.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. If she accepts, I get a great deal. If she counters, I can adjust my strategy based on her response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get closer to $100. How about $95?  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is negotiating, but I think there's still room to go lower. While $95 is closer to my ideal price, I'm willing to push a bit further before accepting or resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for closer to $100, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer suggests a compromise that feels fair to both parties. 
* **Staying Competitive:**  $90 keeps me in a good negotiating position while still offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. 
* **Pressure Point:** Offering a round number like $90 might make it psychologically harder for Alice to reject, particularly if she's eager to make a sale."
