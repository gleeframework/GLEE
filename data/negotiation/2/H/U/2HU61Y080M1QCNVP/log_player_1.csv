"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters, and it's a good starting point to see if he's genuinely interested in the product at a price higher than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $18,000 is a decent price, I'm not ready to settle yet.  I want to see if I can push for something closer to my initial asking price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 19000}
```

I'm going to counter with $19,000. This is a smaller step down from my initial offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my ideal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $18,500 is very close to my desired price and I'm confident that I can't push for much more. Accepting his offer will allow me to make a good profit without risking further rounds of negotiations."
