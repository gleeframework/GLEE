Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. While I understand your budget constraints, I am unable to accept $650,000 for the product. I am proposing a counteroffer of $750,000. This price still reflects the value of the product and allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin. I look forward to your consideration of this offer.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your effort to find a mutually beneficial solution. After careful consideration, I am prepared to offer the product to you for $725,000. This price reflects the value of the product while allowing us to maintain a reasonable profit margin. I hope this proposal aligns better with your budgetary considerations.

At this point, Alice has come down considerably, and $725,000 is a reasonable price considering your $800,000 fallback option with John. Continuing to negotiate might not yield much further reduction, and risks Alice withdrawing the offer altogether."
