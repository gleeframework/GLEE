"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reason:  It's always beneficial to try to negotiate a lower price. Since Bob's maximum budget is $1,500,000 and Alice is willing to sell for $1,200,000, there's room for a lower price.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my initial budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,300,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Reason: Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is within Bob's budget and a reasonable compromise. It's a better deal than buying from John and closer to Alice's desired price point. Accepting allows Bob to save money and acquire the product without further negotiation."
