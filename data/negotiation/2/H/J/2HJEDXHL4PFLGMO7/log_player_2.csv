"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. Based on my understanding of its value, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair.  I'm open to discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,600,000 is far beyond your budget of $800,000.  It's important to start negotiating to bring the price down.  You have 10 rounds, so there's room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can't justify that price. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value to me and the potential for both of us to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and your understanding of the product's value. However, $900,000 is significantly below what I can accept. To be fair to both of us, I can come down to $1,400,000. This reflects the true worth of what I'm offering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down from $1,600,000 to $1,400,000, which is a positive step. However, it's still above your budget.  There's room for further negotiation, and it's too early to buy from John yet. You have 7 rounds left to get to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,400,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,100,000,  which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. This represents the maximum I can afford to pay while still making this deal worthwhile for me."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Your offer is close, but we're still not quite there yet. I can come down slightly to $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal for both of us, considering the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is getting closer to your budget, but it's still too high.  You have 5 rounds left, and you should continue negotiating.  You've shown a willingness to compromise, and there's a good chance Alice will meet you in the middle. Buying from John at this point would mean losing out on potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. $1,300,000 is still a stretch for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  This is a significant commitment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
