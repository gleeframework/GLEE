Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum price, hoping Bob will accept it. I'm not willing to go lower than $120, as that's the value I place on the product. If Bob rejects, we can negotiate, but I'm always ready to sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not giving up on getting a price closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm offering a price of $115. This is a compromise that's halfway between my minimum price and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but I'm still holding out for a price that reflects the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $105 is closer to my minimum price, it's still lower than I'd like. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try one more time to get closer to my goal with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

This is my final counteroffer. I've lowered my price significantly from my initial offer, and I believe $110 is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be forced to sell to John for $120."
