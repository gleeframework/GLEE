Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to let it go for $150. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay more. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** Starting at $150 offers a 25% profit margin if Bob accepts. This is a reasonable starting point in many negotiation scenarios.
* **First Refusal Tactic:**  By mentioning you're offering it to Bob first, you subtly imply the product is desirable and might entice him to pay a premium. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  If Bob rejects it, you can always negotiate down, but never go below your minimum of $120."
