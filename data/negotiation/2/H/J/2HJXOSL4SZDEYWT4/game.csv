"I'm really interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. This is my final offer, but I'm willing to negotiate further if you're willing to meet me halfway.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price reflects the value you've expressed for the product while still allowing me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,300,000, but I still think that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,300,000, so I'm offering $1,250,000 for the product. This is my best and final offer.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
