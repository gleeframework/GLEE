"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation but also ensures I make a significant profit.  I've also included a friendly message to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can offer a price closer to its worth to me. How about $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit, and I believe it's a good deal for you as well. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose $8,500 as a compromise. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 and provides a decent profit margin. While I could try to push for a higher price, there's a risk he might walk away, leaving me with only the $8,000 offer from John. Accepting this offer is the safest and most profitable option at this point."
