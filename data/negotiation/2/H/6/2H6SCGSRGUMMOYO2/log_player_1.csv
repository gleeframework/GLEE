Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still potentially attractive to him. It also includes a positive and encouraging message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product seems great, but $11,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob in the hope of getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  It's the same price I can get from John, and it would be pointless to continue negotiating with Bob only to potentially end up at the same price."
