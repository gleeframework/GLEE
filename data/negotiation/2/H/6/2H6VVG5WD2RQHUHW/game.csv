"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product.  Given its value and the demand I'm seeing, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions or thoughts.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I think $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price. While $15,000 reflects the product's true value, I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  I believe this price point represents a fair compromise. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. While $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd be willing to pay $11,500 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and the market demand.",11500.0,Bob,4,
