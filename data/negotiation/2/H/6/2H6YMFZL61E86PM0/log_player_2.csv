# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $11,000.  This is a fair price considering its worth to me and its potential benefit to your business.  Let me know what you think!

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Here's my counteroffer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective on the price, $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, however. How about $10,250? This would still provide a good value for you while allowing me to make a fair profit. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's offer of $10,250 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay, but it's getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with. I'll try to negotiate a bit further.

I'll reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer.
