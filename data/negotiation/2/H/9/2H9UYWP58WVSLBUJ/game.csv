"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it, and I'm confident it will be a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",850000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $850000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to consider purchasing the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $790000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for this amazing product.",790000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $760000 for the product. I think this is a fair price, considering the value I'll get from it. Can you consider this offer?",760000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $780000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",780000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not ready to commit to $780000. I'm willing to pay $770000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle",770000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $780000. I've already compromised a lot, and I think this is the best price I can offer. If you're not willing to meet me at $780000, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other offers. I'm willing to sell the product to John for $800000, and I think he's a serious buyer. Your final offer of $770000 is a bit too low for me.",780000.0,Alice,7,
