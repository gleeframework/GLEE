"I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $82.50?",82.5,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $82.50 is a bit above your budget, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose $87.50. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",87.5,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $87.50 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $80, which is the price I was initially offered by John. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $80?",80.0,Bob,4,
