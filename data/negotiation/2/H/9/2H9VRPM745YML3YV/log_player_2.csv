"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's in great condition and worth every penny. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference at $13,500?  It's still a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  Alice's offer of $13,500 is still within Bob's budget of $15,000.
* **Negotiation:** Bob has already attempted to lower the price, and Alice has met him halfway.  
* **Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate risks the deal falling apart or reaching a point where Bob is better off buying from John. 

Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a good price without unnecessary risk."
