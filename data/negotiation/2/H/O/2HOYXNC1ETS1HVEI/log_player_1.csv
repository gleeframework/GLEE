"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to start high, at my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to see if Bob is willing to pay my full value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway with a price of $9,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also signals that I'm not desperate to sell at his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to reject his offer and see if he's willing to come up further. If he doesn't, I'm still willing to sell to John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800} 
```

I'm going to lower my price to $8,800. This is closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still trying to get a price that's closer to my minimum.  I'm hoping that showing I'm willing to compromise will lead to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,100 is still too low.  We've been at this for a while, and I'm starting to run out of time. I'm going to sell to John for $10,000. It's not ideal, but it guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price."
