Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $80, so $100 is a price he might be willing to pay, especially if he really wants the product.
* **It's below your minimum:** Your minimum is $120, so this offer gives you some room to negotiate if Bob counters.
* **It's a fair starting point:** This price is not too aggressive, allowing for a potential compromise.

By starting with this offer, you can gauge Bob's interest and potentially find a price that works for both of you.  If Bob rejects, you can then decide if you want to counter or sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $90 for the product. Please let me know if this is possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than Bob's initial value, it's still below my minimum of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low. How about $95? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer, but I can't agree to $95. I'd like to stick to my budget of $80. I hope you understand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum price of $120. It's not worth continuing to negotiate with him at this point. I'll sell the product to John for $120, which is the best option for me."
