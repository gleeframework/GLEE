Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $20,000. It's a fantastic deal on something I know you'll find valuable."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Even though Bob values the product at $8,000, Alice knows it's worth $15,000 to her worst-case scenario (selling to John).  Starting with a high offer of $20,000 leaves room for negotiation and potentially exceeding Bob's valuation.
* **Gauge Interest:**  This initial high offer helps Alice gauge Bob's interest level.  If he flat-out rejects it, she hasn't lost anything and can still sell to John. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** If Bob counters, Alice can gradually lower the price, aiming for the highest price Bob is willing to pay while staying above her minimum of $15,000. 

**Important:**  Alice should be prepared to walk away from the deal if Bob doesn't offer a price above her minimum."
