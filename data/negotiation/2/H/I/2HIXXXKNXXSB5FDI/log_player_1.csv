"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  I want to see how interested Bob is in the product and gauge his potential willingness to pay.  If he rejects, we can negotiate further. However, I'm always aware of the $1,000,000 safety net with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price. While $750,000 is more than the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, I believe there's room for negotiation. I'm going to counter with a lower price than my initial offer but still aim for a significant profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,200,000. It's a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still allows for a good profit. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  It's still a good profit, and I'm running out of rounds. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Bob might walk away.  Accepting this offer is the safest option, guaranteeing a sale and a decent return."
