Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $850,000 is a significant offer, it doesn't quite meet my minimum price point.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, reflecting a fair compromise. This offer still allows me a comfortable margin while giving you a very competitive price for a valuable asset.
