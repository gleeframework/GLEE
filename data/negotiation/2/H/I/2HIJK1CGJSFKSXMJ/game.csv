"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,000,000 would be fair for both of us. This allows for a healthy profit for me while ensuring you secure a valuable asset at a competitive price.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could we settle around $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $850,000 is a significant offer, it doesn't quite meet my minimum price point.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, reflecting a fair compromise. This offer still allows me a comfortable margin while giving you a very competitive price for a valuable asset.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $950,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
