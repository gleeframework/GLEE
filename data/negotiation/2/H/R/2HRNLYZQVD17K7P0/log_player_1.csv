Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the market value of the product is $1,500,000 to you. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 900000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're offering,  $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering your own valuation.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is closer to your own valuation and would make this a win-win situation for both of us.  Let's see if we can close the deal.
