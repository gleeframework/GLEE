"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the market value of the product is $1,500,000 to you. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below the market value for Bob, it's still higher than Alice's own valuation. Bob should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price. There are 9 rounds left, providing ample opportunity to find a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're offering,  $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering your own valuation.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit below my minimum target, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you place on the product and the market value. I believe this is a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is still higher than her valuation but lower than Bob's valuation.  There is still room for negotiation to find a price more favorable to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is closer to your own valuation and would make this a win-win situation for both of us.  Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $800,000 is a tempting offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value I place on the product and the market value. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is reasonable:** $825,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than Bob's market value and higher than Alice's valuation, suggesting a win-win scenario.
* **Time is running out:**  There are only 5 rounds left.  Continuing to negotiate risks running out of time and forcing Bob to buy from John at a significantly higher price.

It's better to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a reasonable price, rather than risk losing the opportunity and paying significantly more to John."
