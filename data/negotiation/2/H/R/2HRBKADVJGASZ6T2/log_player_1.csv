{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price close to my minimum ($15,000) but acknowledging that Bob's value for the product is lower. This allows for some negotiation room while still ensuring a decent profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, and I'm not willing to accept such a large loss. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $11,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. It's a fair price that acknowledges your interest while still being within my acceptable range.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $12,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $12,500 is still below my ideal price, it's a fair compromise.  It's closer to my minimum, and further negotiation might take too much time.  It's better to accept this offer and secure the sale."
