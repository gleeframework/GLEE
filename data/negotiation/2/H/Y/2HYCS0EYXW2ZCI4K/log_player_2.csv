"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible. While $120 is better than $150, you can potentially get the product for less by counter-offering. You also have the option to go with John for $100, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you're trying to save as much as possible, you should offer a price that's significantly lower than Alice's offer. $90 is still a reasonable price considering Alice values the product at $150. You also have the option to buy from John for $100, so you have some leverage in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is closer to your desired price, you can still potentially get it for lower.  Rejecting and counter-offering gives you a chance to push for a better price, especially since you have the fallback option of buying from John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit in her offer, but you're still aiming for a lower price. Offering $95 is a slight increase from your previous counteroffer, showing you're willing to compromise while still pushing for a better deal. It's also close to John's price, giving you leverage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now $105, which is only $5 more than what John is offering.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but it's risky. There's a chance Alice might reject your counteroffer and you'll end up with no deal.  It's better to secure the product now at a price close to your maximum limit and avoid the risk of losing the deal altogether."
