Round 4
Bob's offer:

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested and is inching closer to a reasonable price. We're still significantly above our minimum, and there's room for negotiation."

Round 5

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I'm still a bit above your latest offer. I'm willing to meet you at $875,000, but I need to be careful with my budget. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is holding firm at $875,000, and while we could push for a bit more, it's getting riskier.  This offer is still a significant profit above our minimum, and accepting now guarantees the sale.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing Bob entirely and having to settle for John's offer."
