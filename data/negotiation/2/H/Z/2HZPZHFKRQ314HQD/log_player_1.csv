"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more than $80 to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm offering a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's perceived value:** I'm highlighting that the product is worth more than $80 to him, making the offer more appealing.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm framing it as a good deal, but I'm also open to further discussion. 

This strategy allows me to start strong while also leaving the door open for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $65 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120 and even below Bob's perceived value of $80.  Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, he has shown interest and is willing to negotiate. This means there's still a chance to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Selling to John is always an option:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $120 provides a safety net and gives me leverage during negotiations.

**Next steps:**  I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value while still being reasonable for Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $65 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $85. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product is worth $80 to you. Let's meet halfway and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving towards the middle:** I've moved from my initial $100 offer to $85, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate and compromise.
* **Reiterating Bob's perceived value:** I'm reminding Bob that he values the product at $80, making $85 a reasonable offer.
* **Urging a conclusion:** I'm emphasizing that this is a good opportunity to finalize the deal, creating a sense of urgency. 

By offering a price closer to Bob's perceived value and demonstrating my flexibility, I aim to increase the chances of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to my budget, but $85 is still a bit of a stretch. How about we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $75 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. While it's closer to my desired value than previous offers, accepting would still result in a significant loss.
* **Negotiation continues:** Bob's offer shows he's willing to negotiate further. This means there's potential for a more favorable outcome if I continue the process.
* **Safety net:**  The option to sell to John for $120 provides me with a secure fallback option, giving me leverage in these negotiations.

**Next steps:** I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $85 or higher. I'll reiterate the value the product offers Bob and emphasize the benefit of reaching an agreement quickly."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I can come down to $80 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to you. Let's make this happen, as we're getting close to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price closer to Bob's last offer while still staying above my minimum acceptable price. This shows willingness to find a middle ground.
* **Urgency:** I'm emphasizing that we're getting close to an agreement, creating a sense of urgency to finalize the deal.
* **Value focus:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, reinforcing the reason why $80 is a fair price.

This counteroffer aims to find a balance between my minimum price and Bob's budget constraints, increasing the likelihood of closing the deal in this round."
