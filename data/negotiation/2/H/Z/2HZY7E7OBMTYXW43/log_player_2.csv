Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $775,000 is a significant investment for you, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. I'm counteroffering at $812,500. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $812,500.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","This is a tough one! Alice is definitely sticking to her guns. It's time to make a judgment call:

* **Option 1: Accept for $812,500:**  You get the product and avoid the risk of losing the deal entirely. However, you're paying slightly above your ideal price.

* **Option 2: Counteroffer:** You *might* be able to squeeze out a tiny bit more, but Alice seems pretty firm. There's a risk she walks away.

* **Option 3: Buy from John for $800,000:** This is your guaranteed best price, but you lose the chance to get it even cheaper from Alice.

**My recommendation:** This is really close. If you're feeling risk-averse, {""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} is the safest bet. 

However, if you're willing to gamble a little, you could try one more counteroffer, like $790,000, and see if Alice bites. If she rejects it, immediately {""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}."
