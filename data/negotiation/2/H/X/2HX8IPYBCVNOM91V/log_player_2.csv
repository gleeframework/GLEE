"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $150 is your maximum, there's no reason to immediately accept Alice's offer. We can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're starting with a significant discount to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  A $30 reduction is a reasonable starting point, and hopefully, Alice will see it as a good starting point for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved from $150 to $135, which is a decent compromise.  While we could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will become less flexible or we'll run out of rounds.  Accepting the offer ensures we get the product within our budget and avoid potential delays."
