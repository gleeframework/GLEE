"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

Alice's starting price is closer to her own valuation than yours. There's room for negotiation to get a better price.  We'll counter-offer and see if we can meet closer to the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a nice product, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $105?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $115? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

```

Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price. While we could try to negotiate further, $115 is a decent price and saves us a significant amount compared to John's offer."
