"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential for your business, I believe a price of $2,300,000 is a fair starting point for our discussion. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
This offer is far too high. It's important to start with a counteroffer that reflects a more reasonable price range, closer to your valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is significantly higher than what I had in mind. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the value, however, my initial price takes into account the unique and significant potential this product holds.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a considerable adjustment, and I believe it reflects my eagerness to work with you while still recognizing the product's true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's price is still much higher than your valuation. It's important to show you're serious but also willing to walk away if necessary.  We'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget. To be frank, I'm looking at a maximum of $700,000 for this product.  If we can find an agreement closer to that number, I'm ready to move forward."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to consider a significantly lower price, but it needs to reflect the real value of this product. Would you be willing to discuss a price point around $1,600,000? This is a substantial concession on my end, and I believe it demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice is coming down, but the price is still too high. We're getting closer to your limit with John, so it's time to push a bit harder or consider that option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  While $1,600,000 is closer to the mark, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  I can go up to $750,000, but that's really my limit.  I think this price is a fair reflection of the product's value and allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
