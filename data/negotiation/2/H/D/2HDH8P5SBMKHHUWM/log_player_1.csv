{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  He's getting a deal, but not so much that he'll immediately reject it.
* **It's below your minimum:** This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **It's not too close to John's offer:** You still have leverage to potentially get more than $1,000,000 if Bob is willing to pay more."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm willing to pay no more than $850,000 for the product. Can you meet me halfway and consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below what the product is worth to me. I'm not going to sell it for that price just yet.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $882,500 for the product. Can you consider this price?

While I would prefer a bit more, $882,500 is a good price considering Bob's limits. Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, and it's not worth risking losing this deal and having to sell to John at a lower profit."
