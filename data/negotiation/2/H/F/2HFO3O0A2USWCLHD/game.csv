"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  It's a fair price and I'm ready to buy if you're open to it.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we split the difference again and settle at $14,000?  Let me know if that works for you.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $15,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product brings to you.",15500.0,Alice,5,
