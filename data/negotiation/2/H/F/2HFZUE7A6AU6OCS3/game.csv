"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I'm very interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $800,000. I'd like to propose a price of $800,000. This is a fair offer, considering the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, my initial offer reflects the true value and potential this product holds.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This offer signifies a significant reduction on my end while still reflecting the inherent worth of the product. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still far beyond my budget.  I'm committed to acquiring this product, but I can't go higher than $800,000. This is a serious offer, and I hope you'll consider it.  It's time to compromise.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I recognize your commitment to acquiring this product, and I value your direct approach.  However, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the unique advantages this product offers. It's not just about acquiring an asset; it's about investing in an opportunity that can significantly elevate your business. To demonstrate my willingness to find a solution, I'm proposing $1,400,000. This revised offer represents a considerable compromise on my end while acknowledging the substantial value this product brings.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is still beyond my financial capacity. I'm ready to close the deal, but I need to stick to my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the significant price reductions I've already made. Let's make this happen.",900000.0,Bob,6,
