Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to get a better deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I want to try to get closer to my desired price. $12,000 is still a good deal for Bob, but I think I can get a little more."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is a little low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. That's still a great price for you, considering the product is worth $15,000 to you. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,250 is very close to my desired price, and it's a good deal for him, considering the value of the product to him. Accepting this offer ensures I get a good price and avoid the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
