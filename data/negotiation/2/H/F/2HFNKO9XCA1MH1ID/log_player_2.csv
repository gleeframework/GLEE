"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll find it a valuable addition to your collection. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's offer, but not the best possible outcome.**  You can get the product for $950,000 from Alice, while John wants $1,000,000.
* **You want to save as much money as possible.** By rejecting Alice's offer, you can potentially negotiate a lower price with her or find another seller. 

**Next Steps:**

Since you're aiming for the lowest price, you should try to negotiate with Alice further. You could:

* **Counter with a lower offer.** Try $900,000 or something in between.
* **Ask for more information.**  See if there's any room for negotiation on price based on payment terms, delivery, or other factors."
