**Reasoning:**

While we could continue to push for a higher price, Bob has now hit his previous highest offer and seems unwilling to budge.  There's a risk that if we push further, he might walk away. Accepting $1,150,000 secures a significant profit over our minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely."
