"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting high, at $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, while still being above my minimum acceptable price. It's important to start strong to establish a good bargaining position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for it just yet. I'll see if I can get Bob to go higher by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves some room for a profit.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I think I can still get a better price. I'm not going to rush into a sale, especially since I have the option to sell to John for $12,000 if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $13,000.  I'm hoping this shows flexibility and encourages Bob to meet me in the middle. We're getting close to a deal, and I don't want to risk losing him entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's only $200 above my minimum, we're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds. I don't want to risk losing the sale and having to settle for John's offer. This is the best I can do at this point."
