"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to you, and I believe it's an excellent investment. Would you like to purchase it for $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is a good start, but there's room for negotiation. I'll try a counteroffer in the next round to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was hoping to get it for a bit less.  Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation and shows I'm serious about buying.
* **Anchoring:** By starting low, I'm setting an anchor point for the negotiation. Even if Alice doesn't accept this price, it might make her more receptive to a smaller counteroffer later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. After considering your offer, I've decided to counter with a price of $125. This allows us to meet somewhere in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving towards my price, which is a good sign. However, there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject this offer and propose a price closer to $110 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for understanding, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $117?"",
""product_price"": 117
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm signaling a willingness to compromise by moving closer to Alice's counteroffer. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $117 is a specific number that suggests careful consideration and a genuine desire to reach a deal. It also keeps me firmly in the ""saving a good amount"" territory compared to John's offer.
* **Time Constraint:**  While I have rounds left, I don't want to drag the negotiation out unnecessarily.  This offer shows I'm serious about closing the deal soon."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I propose we settle on $122 for the product. It's a fair compromise given its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  While I could try to negotiate further, Alice's offer is now getting close to my initial target.  The potential savings from further haggling are probably not worth the risk of the negotiation falling apart.
* **Fair Deal:**  $122 is a significant discount from both Alice's starting price and John's offer. It's a good deal overall. 
* **Time Saved:** Accepting now avoids potential frustration and wasted time in further rounds."
