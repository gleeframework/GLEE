Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,200,000, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  I'm also aware that I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000, so I'm not desperate to make a deal with Bob.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not eager to accept it just yet.  I believe there's still potential to get a higher price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,400,000. This is still a good profit for me, and hopefully, it's attractive enough for Bob to accept, avoiding the need to go through more rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm not willing to go that far below my minimum acceptable price.  John is offering a much more reasonable price, and I'm going to accept his offer and sell to him."
