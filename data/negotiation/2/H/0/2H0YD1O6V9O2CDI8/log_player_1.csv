Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's high, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appeal to Value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, giving him an incentive to consider my offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message leaves the door open for Bob to counteroffer, setting the stage for a back-and-forth.
* **Safety Net:**  I can always walk away and sell to John for $800,000, so I'm not taking a huge risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to get closer to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** Bob's counteroffer is closer to my desired price range, but there's still room to negotiate.
* **Testing the Waters:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to see if he's serious about getting this product and is willing to go higher.
* **Avoiding a Loss:**  While $900,000 is better than $800,000, I'm not willing to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your budget, $900,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? That would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  The price is still above my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not giving away too much.
* **Positive Language:** Using phrases like ""fair compromise"" and ""appreciate your willingness to negotiate"" helps maintain a positive tone and encourages Bob to continue the discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to offer $925,000. That's the highest I can go without exceeding my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer is very close to my target price.  
* **Limited Upside:**  I've already negotiated quite a bit. Further negotiation might not yield a significantly higher price, and I risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Avoiding Risk:** Accepting this offer secures a substantial profit and eliminates the risk of Bob walking away or my having to settle for John's lower offer."
