"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about $1,100,000? This would still be a fantastic deal for you, considering the product's value.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $950,000. That's the highest I can go, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's settle this and move forward.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and $1,050,000, so I'll offer $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
