"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $200.",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $200 is a bit steep for me.  How about $125?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $200 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $175. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $175 is still a little too high for me. I'm really hoping to get this product, but I can't go above $140.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this work.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $160 for the product. How about we meet at $155?",155.0,Alice,5,
