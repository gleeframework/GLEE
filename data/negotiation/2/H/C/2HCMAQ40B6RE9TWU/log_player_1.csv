{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are still comfortably above John's offer.  Bob is moving closer to our acceptable range, but we need to hold firm to maximize our profit. It's time to show Bob we're serious about our bottom line."

}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This offer sends a strong signal that we're getting close to our bottom line. It gives Bob a chance to make a deal significantly above John's offer while still leaving us with a good profit. By stating it's our final offer, we increase the pressure for him to accept."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,625,000 for the product. Can you reconsider?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer beyond this point.  Holding out for a slightly better offer from Bob risks losing the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. Accepting John's offer ensures a good profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
