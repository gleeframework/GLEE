# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's not worth buying from Alice at $18,000.  The product is only worth $10,000 to Bob.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy."

While $14,000 is better than $18,000, it's still more than the product is worth to Bob. It's better to keep negotiating and see if Alice will go lower."

While $13,500 is a better price than Alice's previous offers, it's still above what Bob is willing to pay. There's still room for negotiation, and it's worth seeing if Alice will budge further."
