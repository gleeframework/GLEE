``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but significantly less than your minimum acceptable price. This allows for negotiation and provides room for Bob to counter without you immediately feeling like you need to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only able to offer $1200000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?

Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. While I see the value in your product, I am unable to meet you at $1250000. I would like to propose $1225000 as a compromise. This allows us to stay closer to my maximum budget while still providing you with a fair price for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,225,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied.  I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price before considering selling to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see that we're both trying to find a middle ground here.  I'm willing to go down to $1,240,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After careful consideration, I am willing to offer $1235000 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,235,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,235,000

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer of $1,235,000 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price.  It's better than selling to John for $1,500,000, and it saves me the effort of further negotiations."
