Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm glad you're willing to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll go up to $10,500. I think that's a fair price, considering the value you place on the product and the fact that we're getting close to the maximum price you're willing to pay. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is very slowly lowering her price. It's clear she's trying to get as close to your $10,000 maximum as possible.  At this point, it's not worth the risk of continued negotiation. John offers a guaranteed price of $10,000, which is better than Alice's current offer and saves you the uncertainty of further haggling."
