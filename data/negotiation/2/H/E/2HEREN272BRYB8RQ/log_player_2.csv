Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to make a significant move, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $700,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so I'll counter with $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. What are your thoughts?

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $900,000. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for the guaranteed $800,000."
