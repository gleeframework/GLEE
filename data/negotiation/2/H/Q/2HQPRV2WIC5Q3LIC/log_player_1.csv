"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find immensely valuable.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I'm confident this reflects a fair starting point for us to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We begin with a strong offer significantly above our minimum ($1,000,000) but below Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Confident Tone:** Projecting confidence in the product's value can influence Bob's perception and willingness to pay.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""starting point"" clearly indicates flexibility and a willingness to negotiate a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiations at $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is above our absolute minimum, it's still significantly lower than our target price. We have room to negotiate, and it's unlikely Bob would walk away from a deal that still offers him a $400,000 potential gain. We'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you engaging in this negotiation. I understand your perspective on the initial price. Considering the value this product brings, I'm proposing $1,275,000. This offer reflects a willingness to find a middle ground while ensuring a fair return on a unique product."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We've made a significant concession from $1,350,000 to $1,275,000, demonstrating a willingness to move towards a deal.
* **Highlighting Value:** We're reiterating the product's value to justify the price and nudge Bob towards the upper end of his potential range.
* **Middle Ground:** This offer sits almost perfectly between our starting offer and Bob's counter, signaling a desire for a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the adjusted offer.  I'm getting closer, but there's still a gap for me. How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $1,187,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,187,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,187,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're making progress, and Bob is clearly engaged in the negotiation by proposing a midpoint. However, accepting $1,187,500 would leave a significant amount of potential profit on the table. We are still comfortably above our minimum and have room to negotiate further. We'll counter again, aiming to steer closer to $1.2 million."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we're getting closer.  I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. To bridge the remaining gap, I'm proposing $1,225,000. This recognizes the value you see in the product while reflecting its true worth."", ""product_price"": 1225000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:** We're starting by acknowledging Bob's efforts in moving towards a deal, keeping the tone positive.
* **Smaller Concession:** We're making a smaller concession this round (down to $1,225,000 from $1,275,000) to signal we're reaching the higher end of our acceptable range.
* **Reiterating Value:**  We're subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price without being overly aggressive.
* **Targeting the Sweet Spot:** This offer is designed to be tempting for Bob â€“ close enough to his last offer to seem reasonable, but still providing us with a strong profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're a tough negotiator! I respect that.  Let's aim for a win-win. How about $1,200,000? I feel that's a strong offer reflecting the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a strong deal for us. Here's why:

* **Excellent Profit:**  We're securing a $200,000 profit above our minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  While we have rounds remaining, prolonged negotiations can become risky. Bob might become less willing to compromise, or external factors could emerge.
* **Solid Value:** The offer reflects a fair value for the product. While we *could* push for more, the risk of losing the deal at this stage outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price.

Accepting now ensures a win-win situation and a substantial return on our valuable product."
