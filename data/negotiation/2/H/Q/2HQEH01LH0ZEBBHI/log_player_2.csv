Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to meet me at $120, but I'm still not ready to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to compromise again, so how about we try $125? It's a small step up from your offer, but I think it's still a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125

While I could try to negotiate further, $125 is a reasonable price and a good compromise. It avoids the risk of Alice increasing her price or the negotiation failing, leading me to pay $150 to John."
