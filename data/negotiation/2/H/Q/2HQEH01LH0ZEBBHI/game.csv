"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm still a bit far from $110. How about we meet in the middle at $130? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to meet me at $120, but I'm still not ready to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to compromise again, so how about we try $125? It's a small step up from your offer, but I think it's still a fair deal.",125.0,Alice,5,
