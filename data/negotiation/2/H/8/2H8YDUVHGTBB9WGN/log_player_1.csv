"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a positive and friendly tone encourages Bob to engage.
* **Value Proposition:** Briefly highlighting the product's value to Bob might incentivize him to consider the offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message makes it clear that I'm willing to negotiate, leaving room for a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While it's a step up from his perceived value, $8,500 is still significantly below my minimum threshold of $12,000. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I want to see if I can push Bob closer to my desired price point. There are still 8 rounds left, and I believe I can secure a better deal.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees a good profit. However, I'm still hopeful that I can secure a higher price from Bob, especially since he's already shown interest."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your budget concerns, $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,250. This would allow both of us to find some middle ground. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm counter-offering with $9,250, which is still above my minimum but significantly lower than my initial offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Middle Ground:** I emphasize the ""middle ground"" aspect to make the offer seem more appealing and reasonable to Bob.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** I'm staying polite and encouraging, aiming to keep the negotiation amicable. 
* **Room for Future Negotiations:** I'm not going too low, as I still have 7 rounds left to secure a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,250, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but Not Close Enough:**  While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $9,000 is still below my minimum threshold of $12,000.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** With 6 rounds left, I believe there's still room to push for a price closer to my minimum. Bob has shown interest and is willing to negotiate, indicating he might be willing to go higher.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While selling to John for $12,000 is tempting, I'm not willing to give up on a potential higher offer from Bob. I'm confident I can secure a better deal if I keep negotiating."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer of $9,000. It's getting closer to where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,125?  I think this would be a fair compromise for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** By offering $9,125, I'm showing a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a higher price. This small increment might be more appealing to Bob than a larger jump.
* **Emphasize Fairness:**  I use the phrase ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and to suggest a win-win situation.
* **Maintaining Momentum:** I'm still confident I can push for a higher price, but this counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward.
* **Time Factor:** With 5 rounds left, I need to start closing the gap."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above your target price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway on the previous offer. I'll give you $9,000, but I need you to come down to $9,000. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob has repeated his offer of $9,000, it's still below my minimum threshold of $12,000. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 4 rounds remaining, I need to be cautious about making a decision.  
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** I'm hopeful that I can still push for a better price. Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and I believe there's still potential for a higher offer.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Selling to John for $12,000 is a guaranteed profit, but I'm not ready to give up on a potentially better deal with Bob.  The risk of losing out on a higher price from Bob outweighs the security of selling to John at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking with $9,000. I'm willing to come down to $9,100, but that's my final offer.  This is a good price for both of us. If you can't meet me at this price, I might have to explore other options.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm stating this is my final offer to create a sense of urgency and potentially push Bob to accept.
* **Slightly Lower:** I'm dropping my price slightly to show I'm flexible but still holding firm.
* **Alternative Options:** I mention exploring other options (John) to subtly remind Bob that there are alternatives if he doesn't accept. 
* **Time is Running Out:** With 3 rounds remaining, I need to push for a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $9,100. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but I need you to come down to $8,900. That's my final offer. If you can meet me at this price, I'll buy the product from you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Unacceptable:**  Bob's final offer of $8,900 is significantly below my minimum threshold of $12,000.  It's not even close to a reasonable compromise.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only two rounds left, the chances of securing a higher price from Bob are extremely low. He's shown a stubborn unwillingness to budge.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees a significant profit.  The risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob is too high.  The potential loss from continuing the negotiation outweighs the possibility of securing a higher price from Bob. 
* **Time is of the Essence:** I cannot afford to waste any more time on a negotiation that is unlikely to yield a satisfactory result.  It's time to cut my losses and move on to a guaranteed deal."
