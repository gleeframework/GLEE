Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a strategic balance:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($800,000),** increasing your potential profit.
* **It's lower than the product's value to Bob ($1,200,000),** leaving room for negotiation and making the deal attractive to him. 

By offering a price in the middle, you maximize your chances of securing a sale while also getting closer to the maximum value possible."
