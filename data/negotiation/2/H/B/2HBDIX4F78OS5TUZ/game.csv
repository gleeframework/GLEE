"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1,800,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is below my minimum.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,500,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which is a fair compromise. This would allow us both to get a good deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
