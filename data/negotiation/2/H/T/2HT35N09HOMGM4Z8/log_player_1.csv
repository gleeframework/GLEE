"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,150,000. It's a fair price, considering its value to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I have 9 more rounds to negotiate, and Bob clearly wants the product, so I have leverage. I'll try to squeeze out a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not quite there yet. $1,125,000 reflects the value of this product and is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,075,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below the $1,000,000 I'd get from John. I have 6 more rounds to try and get a better price from Bob. It's not worth settling for less than John's offer just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial position, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,075,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

The negotiation seems to be stuck. Bob keeps offering the same price, and I'm hesitant to drop further.  With only 4 rounds left, it's risky to continue.  John's offer is my guaranteed minimum, and I'd rather secure that than risk a further decline in price from Bob."
