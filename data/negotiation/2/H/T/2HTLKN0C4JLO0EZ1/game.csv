"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a one-time offer, and I believe it's a great value considering the product's worth to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice! I appreciate you coming down to $900,000. However, I'm looking to save even more.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering your own value for the product, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to save even more, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's value to you, while also being a fair price for me.",825000.0,Alice,3,
