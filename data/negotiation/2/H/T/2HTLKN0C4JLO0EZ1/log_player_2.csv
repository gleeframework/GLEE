"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a one-time offer, and I believe it's a great value considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is better than $1,000,000, Bob knows the product is worth less to Alice. There's potential to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice! I appreciate you coming down to $900,000. However, I'm looking to save even more.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering your own value for the product, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to save even more, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825,000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's value to you, while also being a fair price for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  $825,000 is significantly less than $1,000,000.
* **There's little room for further negotiation:**  Alice has already come down from $900,000 to $825,000. It's likely that further counteroffers will either be rejected or lead to a price closer to John's offer. 

By accepting Alice's offer, Bob gets a good deal and avoids potentially wasting time in further negotiations."
