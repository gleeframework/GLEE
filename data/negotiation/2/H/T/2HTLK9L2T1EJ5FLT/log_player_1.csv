Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some space for potential negotiation with Bob while still staying above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but not unreasonably high. This might pique his interest, especially if you highlight the product's value proposition effectively in your message. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't have time constraints or other reasons to prioritize a quick sale to John."
