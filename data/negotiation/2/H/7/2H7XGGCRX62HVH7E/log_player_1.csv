Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I should aim higher with Bob to maximize potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $15,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down if he finds the initial price too high. 
* **Confident Presentation:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the price as a starting point for discussion, not an ultimatum.

By offering the product at $15,000, I have the potential to:

* **Secure a Higher Profit:** If Bob accepts, I earn $5,000 more than selling to John.
* **Negotiate a Favorable Price:** Even if Bob counters, the negotiation is likely to settle above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000."
