"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is a fair starting point for our discussion. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin for both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product. While $1,050,000 is a fair offer, I was hoping to settle closer to $1,100,000. This price reflects the true potential and unique benefits this product offers. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This would be a good compromise for both of us. I'm confident that we can reach an agreement if we're both willing to be flexible.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
