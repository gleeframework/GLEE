"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price seems a bit high to me.  Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $900,000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $900,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating willingness to negotiate. We're still significantly above John's offer, so it's worth continuing the negotiation for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This reflects the product's value while recognizing your budget concerns."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer. Let's try $800,000. I think that's a fair offer reflecting the value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has met John's offer. There's no guarantee of securing a higher price from Bob in the remaining rounds, and we risk him lowering his offer. Accepting now guarantees the best possible outcome."
