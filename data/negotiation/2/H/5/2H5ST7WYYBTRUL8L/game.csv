"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I'm confident you won't find anywhere else. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a great starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product is valuable, the price is a little high for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $650,000 is a bit below my minimum target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $750,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $750,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $700,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $725,000. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,5,
