# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I'm confident you won't find anywhere else. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a great starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $650,000 is a bit below my minimum target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $750,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $750,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $700,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 700000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $725,000. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $725,000 is still above your ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise. Consider these factors:

* **Significant Savings:** You're still saving $75,000 compared to John's offer. 
* **Time Investment:**  Continuing negotiations might not yield a much better result, and you risk Alice becoming less willing to compromise.
* **Unknown Variables:** There's always a chance Alice might walk away in future rounds, forcing you to buy from John at the higher price. 

Taking this offer secures you a good deal and avoids the risk of losing out on the product entirely."
