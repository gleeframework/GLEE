Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000. This price reflects a fair compromise and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
