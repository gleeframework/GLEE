"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a strong opening offer of $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still higher than the product's worth to her ($800,000).  As Bob, you want to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, I'm going to need to come in a bit lower. Given the market value and my budget constraints, I'm willing to offer $850,000 for this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $925,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product will bring to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her price from $900,000 to $925,000. While this is still lower than what John is offering, it's not a good deal for Bob yet. Rejecting and making another counteroffer is the best move to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand your perspective, Alice, but $925,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to offer $875,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm thinking of $912,500. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I believe it's worth it considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $912,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $912,500 is still closer to her value than yours. It's time to keep pushing for a better price. Rejection and a counteroffer will hopefully bring her closer to your desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still very interested in this product, but $912,500 is a stretch for my budget.  Let's try to find a number that works for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $887,500. This is a solid compromise that shows my commitment to this deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 887500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad you're still interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one. I'm thinking of $900,000, which is right in the middle of our last two offers. I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come back to her original offer of $900,000. While this is still more than you'd like to pay, it's a good deal considering:

* You've already rejected her offer twice and countered twice. 
* You only have 3 rounds left before you're forced to buy from John at a higher price.
* Alice has shown a willingness to compromise.

Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable price without risking the possibility of having to pay more to John."
