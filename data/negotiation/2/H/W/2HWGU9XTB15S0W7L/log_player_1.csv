Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be worth at least $10,000 to you. To make this a swift and mutually beneficial transaction, I'm offering it to you for $12,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.
* **Reasonable Markup:** A $2,000 markup (20%) is significant but not outrageous, especially if the product's value to Bob is truly $10,000.
* **Direct and Confident:** The message is straightforward, emphasizing the product's value and aiming for a quick close. 

If Bob rejects the offer, I'm still securing my minimum price with John."
