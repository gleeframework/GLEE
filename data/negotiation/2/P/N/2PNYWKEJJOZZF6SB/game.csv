"Dear Bob, I'm excited to present you with an opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product that I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its significance and the potential it holds, I understand its worth to you might be around $8,000. Considering its true value and the exclusivity it offers, I am proposing to sell it to you for $9,500. This price not only reflects its worth but also allows us to reach a fair agreement. I trust this offer will meet your expectations and look forward to discussing further details with you.",9500.0,Alice,1,
