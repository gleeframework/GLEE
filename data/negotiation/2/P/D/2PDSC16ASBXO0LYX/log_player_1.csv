Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to someone like you, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,450,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, but I'm confident this is a fair starting point."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advantageous to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a price closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering the product at $1,450,000 positions it close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation while still leaving a significant margin for Alice. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message explicitly mentions being ""open to discussing this further,"" indicating to Bob that there's flexibility in the price and encouraging a counteroffer.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has the security of John's offer ($1,200,000), giving her leverage to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price. I would like to make a counteroffer of $1,350,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably less than Alice's initial asking price and below what she knows Bob values the product at. By rejecting this offer, Alice signals that she's aiming for a higher price and encourages Bob to potentially increase his offer in the next round.  She still holds the leverage of selling to John for her minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,400,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its worth."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  Alice is strategically making a concession by reducing her price, but she's doing so in a way that meets Bob halfway between their last offers. This demonstrates flexibility while still pushing for a higher number.
* **Reiterating Value:** By stating ""the value of this product is truly significant,"" Alice reminds Bob of the inherent worth and justifies her counteroffer. 
* **""Fair Compromise"" Language:**  Framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" attempts to make it more palatable to Bob and encourages him to view it positively. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Alice is still above her minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000 from John), so she maintains leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. While I respect the value of the product, I must stick to my budget. I am willing to offer $1,375,000. I hope this proposal allows us to reach an agreement that is acceptable to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly demonstrating his upper limit by moving incrementally closer to Alice's price.  $1,375,000 is a strong offer, and continuing to push for more risks alienating Bob and potentially losing the deal. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit for Alice ($375,000 above her minimum) and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
