Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I believe it's worth $150 to you, and while I value it highly, I'm willing to part with it for $120. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Since Bob values the product at $150, starting at $120 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant gain for you.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The offer is framed as a win-win. You acknowledge Bob's perceived value while justifying your price. 
* **Alternative Option:** You have a safety net with John ($80), so you're not desperate. This allows you to confidently negotiate from a position of strength."
