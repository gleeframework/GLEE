"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high with $1,000,000. This is a strong opening offer that reflects the product's value to me. It also gives me room to negotiate downward if Bob rejects my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is a good offer, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll reject this offer and try to counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I want to see if Bob is willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to gauge Bob's interest at a price that's closer to his offer but still leaves some profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has offered my minimum acceptable price. Accepting this offer secures a sale and guarantees I reach my goal. There's no reason to risk further negotiation and potentially get a lower price, especially since I have a guaranteed $800,000 from John."
