"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to be closer to my original offer. How about $1,125,000? This price would still be a great deal for you, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,125,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
