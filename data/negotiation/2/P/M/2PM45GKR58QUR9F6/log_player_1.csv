Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.  This gives me a chance to earn more than my minimum while still potentially reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $70 is better than nothing, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $80. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get Bob to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $75? That seems like a fair compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 75}
``` 
I'm offering a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer, but still higher than my minimum. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate and reach a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to make a compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $72? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $72
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd ideally like to get closer to my minimum of $80, Bob's offer of $72 is a reasonable compromise and better than selling to John for $80. I'm willing to accept this offer and close the deal."
