"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  This reflects the product's worth while still being a fair deal.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000, which is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  Let's make this work - I'm willing to accept $14,000. This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end while acknowledging the product's value.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $12,500 for the product. This is a fair price that I'm willing to pay for the product.",12500.0,Bob,6,
