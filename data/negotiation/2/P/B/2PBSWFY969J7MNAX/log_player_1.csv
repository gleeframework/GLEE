Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's something you're interested in, and I believe it will be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

Here's the reasoning behind this offer:

* **Maximizing Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While $14,000 is our ideal price, starting a bit higher leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, making him feel like he got a better deal. 
* **Strong but Not Greedy:** This offer shows we understand the product's worth while still leaving a significant profit margin."
