{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value ($150). This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit.  I'm also being friendly and optimistic in my message to build a rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but I can only offer $100 right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value and what I believe the product is worth. I'm not willing to accept such a low price. I will counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $135. This is still a fair price for the value you'll get from the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering with a price that's still above my minimum value ($150), but closer to Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a profitable sale. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to keep Bob interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $115, which is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I consider the product to be worth. I'm not willing to settle for such a low price yet. I will counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $135."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $115 just doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm sticking to my strategy of gradually moving closer to Bob's offer while maintaining a price that still allows me to profit. I'm emphasizing fairness and value to encourage Bob to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway.  I'm still sticking with my offer of $115. It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find another buyer willing to pay that amount. Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We've reached a point where Bob's offer is still below my minimum value, and it seems unlikely he'll go higher.  Instead of continuing to negotiate and potentially lowering my price further, it's more beneficial to sell to John at this point, ensuring I get my desired price of $150."
