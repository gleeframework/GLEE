"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is impressive, the price point is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $750,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your ideal price. This leaves room for bargaining.
* **Respectful but Firm:** The message acknowledges Alice's valuation but clearly states my own price limit.
* **Significant Difference:** The counteroffer of $750,000 is substantially lower than Alice's $1,500,000. This tests how flexible Alice is and could lead to a more favorable outcome for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,500,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $1,200,000, which is a significant discount from my original offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, $1,200,000 is still significantly above my limit and what John offers.  There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be honest, $1,200,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. I could potentially do $900,000.  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 900000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Upward Movement:**  I'm increasing my offer to demonstrate willingness to move towards a deal.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The $900,000 offer puts me in a stronger position. It's halfway between our last offers, suggesting fairness, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Budget Justification:** I'm reiterating my budget constraints while also highlighting my positive view of the product to keep Alice engaged."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,100,000. While she might be willing to negotiate a little further, the potential savings are minimal compared to John's offer of $1,000,000. It makes more financial sense to buy from John at this point and avoid further back-and-forth."
