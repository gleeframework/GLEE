"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something that will greatly benefit your business. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $12,000 for the product.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. I'm very interested in this product, but I'd like to offer you $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that I'm ready to close the deal.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you justifies a higher price. Considering your offer of $9,500, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $11,000. This price still leaves room for negotiation, but I believe it's a more realistic reflection of the product's worth.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit too high. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $9,500. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal right now.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not comfortable with $9,500. Considering your previous offers and the value of the product, I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $10,800. This price takes into account your concerns and still reflects the product's worth to you.",10800.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down further, but $10,800 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and try $10,000. I'm very eager to make this purchase, and this feels like a fair and reasonable compromise. ",10000.0,Bob,6,
