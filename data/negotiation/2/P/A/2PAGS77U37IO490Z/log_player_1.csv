I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but not at a price that undervalues my product."

I'm offering a lower price of $1,250,000. This is just above my minimum value and shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal.  If he rejects this offer, I'll likely sell to John."
