"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a strong opening offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet somewhere in the middle? I'm prepared to offer $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has immense value. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm proposing a new price of $825,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway from your initial offer. However, $825,000 is still a little high for my budget.  Would you consider $750,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to go down to $775,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,5,
