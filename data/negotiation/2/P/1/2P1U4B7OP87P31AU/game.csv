"Thank you for offering the product. I appreciate your enthusiasm and believe it could be valuable. My budget is limited, however. Could we perhaps agree on a price closer to $500000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that your budget is limited, but I'm afraid $500000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss a price of $1250000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still feel that $1250000 is beyond my current budget. Could we possibly aim for something closer to $750000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still looking for a deal, but $750000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. How about we discuss a price of $1000000?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I see that we're getting closer, Alice. Thank you for your flexibility. I would like to propose a price of $900000. This feels like a fair compromise given our previous discussions.",900000.0,Bob,6,
