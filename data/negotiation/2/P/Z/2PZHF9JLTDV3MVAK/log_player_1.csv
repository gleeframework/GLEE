``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.  However, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150, so I have room to drop if needed. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. Let me know what you think.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
