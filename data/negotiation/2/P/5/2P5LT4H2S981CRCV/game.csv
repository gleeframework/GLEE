,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $115 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a little too high. I'm really only able to offer $108 at this time.  It's the most I can afford, and I'm hoping we can make this work.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still hoping we can find a compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $109? This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's within your budget.  Let's finalize this deal.",109.0,Alice,5,
