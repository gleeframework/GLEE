Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counter-offer. This allows me to gauge his interest and see if he values the product more than $1,000,000 (what John is offering). If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be ready to negotiate further, keeping in mind John's offer as my safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is a significant improvement from his initial rejection, but it's still below my desired price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price. I'll use this opportunity to send a counter-offer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,300,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing willingness to compromise. I believe it's a fair price considering Bob's offer and my minimum price of $1,000,000.  We'll see if Bob accepts this offer or if we need to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to John's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting this offer guarantees a sale significantly higher than John's. There's a risk in continuing to negotiate and potentially ending up with John's lower offer, so I'll take this deal."
