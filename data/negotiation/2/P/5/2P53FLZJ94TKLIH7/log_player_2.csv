Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $11,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.

You're still closer to your target price of $10,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer gives you another chance to negotiate a better price."

Alice has come down significantly, and you're only $900 over your ideal price.  At this point, it's likely you won't get a lower price from Alice, and it's more worthwhile to accept the offer rather than risk losing the deal and having to pay $10,000 to John."
