"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still too high.  While it's better than John's price, there's room for negotiation to save more money.  Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer to be made, potentially bringing the price down closer to Alice's value of $800,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a better return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value it holds for you and my initial asking price. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still above my target.  It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. If Alice doesn't budge, I can always go to John, but I want to exhaust all options with Alice first."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not ready to accept $875,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $885,000. This is as close as I'm willing to get to your offer, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $885,000 is very close to my last counteroffer of $875,000.  Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of Alice rejecting my offer and me having to buy from John at a much higher price is too high.  At this point, accepting Alice's offer secures the product for me at a price that is significantly better than John's."
