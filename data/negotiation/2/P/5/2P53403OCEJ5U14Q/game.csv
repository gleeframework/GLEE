"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While the product is valuable to me, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. This reflects a fair price for both of us, considering your value and my budget. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a better return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value it holds for you and my initial asking price. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. It's a fair price that allows for both of us to get a good deal. Let's see if we can make this work.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not ready to accept $875,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $885,000. This is as close as I'm willing to get to your offer, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",885000.0,Alice,5,
