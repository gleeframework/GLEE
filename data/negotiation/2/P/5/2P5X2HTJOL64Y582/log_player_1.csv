Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you don't settle for less than your fallback option.
* **Justification for Price:** Highlighting the ""unique value"" and ""significant benefits"" aims to justify the high asking price and appeal to Bob's potential desire for a valuable asset. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone of the message suggests openness to discussion. Phrases like ""I'm proposing"" and ""What do you think?"" invite Bob to counter-offer and engage in a negotiation.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while acknowledging Bob's perspective as a potential buyer."
