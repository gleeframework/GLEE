"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  $900,000 is a bit low for me, considering the value I know this product holds. How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? This allows for a fair profit for both of us and helps move things along.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $920,000. I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. $920,000 is still a bit far from my ideal price. How about we meet in the middle at $935,000? It's a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be well worth the investment.",935000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still think $935,000 is a bit high. How about we try $915,000? I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.",915000.0,Bob,6,
