"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your decision.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this product, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you to get a profitable sale and me to get a good value for my investment. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $875,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal.",875000.0,Alice,3,
