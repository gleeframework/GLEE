Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this product, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you to get a profitable sale and me to get a good value for my investment. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
