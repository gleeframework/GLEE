"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're the only supplier of this product, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000 for the product. This is a one-time offer, and I'm open to negotiations. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in pursuing. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $1,000,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I think the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's unique features and benefits. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in pursuing.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $1,050,000. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still not willing to compromise too much on the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, which is a bit above your offer but still a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in pursuing.

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but she's also holding firm on a price above $1,050,000.  At $1,075,000, you're getting a significant discount from both Alice's original offer and John's price. It's unlikely further haggling will yield a much better result, and you risk Alice withdrawing from the negotiation entirely."
