"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. The product looks promising, but  $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $1,000,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I think the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's unique features and benefits. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in pursuing.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello again Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is still a bit above what I had in mind. How about we settle at $1,050,000? ",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your revised offer of $1,050,000. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still not willing to compromise too much on the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, which is a bit above your offer but still a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in pursuing.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
