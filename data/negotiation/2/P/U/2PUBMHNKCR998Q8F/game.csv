,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. How about $75? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $82. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $82 is still a little too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $80. That way we both get what we want.",80.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to give up too much. I'll meet you at $81, and that's my final offer. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",81.0,Alice,5,
