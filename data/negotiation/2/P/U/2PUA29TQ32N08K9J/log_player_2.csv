We're close to my maximum, but I'm still not willing to accept $4,500. Let's see if we can get a slightly better deal with one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

We're running out of time, and Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum. It's better to secure the product from John for $12,000.  While it's not the best deal, it guarantees I get the product and avoids the risk of Alice rejecting my next counteroffer."
