"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,050,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $1,050,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference from our previous offers and settle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is as low as I can go, and I hope you'll consider it.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
