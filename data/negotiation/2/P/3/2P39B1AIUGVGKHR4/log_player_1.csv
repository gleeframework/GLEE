Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $130. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You know Bob values the product at $150, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum price ($100).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **Avoiding an Automatic Rejection:**  A price too close to $150 might make Bob balk, even though it's a price he'd theoretically accept. 
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $100 from John, so you don't have to settle for less than that.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while ensuring a high probability of a successful sale."
