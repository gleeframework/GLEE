"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save a bit, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,500. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,500 is still a bit more than I'm aiming for. How about we split the difference and settle at $8,250? ",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8,250, Bob. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $8,750? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's worth it for this amazing product.",8750.0,Alice,5,
