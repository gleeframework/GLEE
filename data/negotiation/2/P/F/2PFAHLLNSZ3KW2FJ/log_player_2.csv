"Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

It's almost certain that the product is worth more than $999,999 to Alice, otherwise, she wouldn't be selling it.  It's unlikely Alice will offer it for less in the next round, so accepting this price is the best strategy to maximize savings."
