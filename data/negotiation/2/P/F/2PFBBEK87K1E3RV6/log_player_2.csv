"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I believe you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $13,000 is a better deal than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That's still a good value for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $15,000 and is close to Bob's initial counteroffer of $11,000.  There's not much more room for negotiation, so accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price."
