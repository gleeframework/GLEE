"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than the product's value to Bob, but not outrageously so. I want to see if I can push for a higher price, but I'm also aware that I don't want to risk losing him as a buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $13,000. This is a compromise, but still higher than Bob's last offer. I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous one, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I will reject and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to drop my price to $12,500.  This is a significant concession, but I'm hoping Bob will see it as a sign of good faith and be willing to meet me halfway. If he doesn't, I'm prepared to sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price and the same as John's offer.  I will accept this offer and sell the product to Bob.  While I would have preferred a higher price, it's not worth risking further negotiation and losing the deal entirely."
