"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer, aiming to establish a lower starting point for negotiation. This initial counteroffer reflects Bob's willingness to purchase the product but also signals his desire to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum price of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another opportunity to negotiate and potentially get a better price. There are still rounds left, and Bob can always buy from John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing a willingness to compromise.  He's still below his maximum price, and it's possible Alice might accept this offer, especially as time is running out. This strategy aims to find a middle ground and close the deal before having to resort to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum price of $12,000.  Even though it's getting closer, Bob has already made a counteroffer and might be able to get a better deal with more negotiation.  There are still rounds left, and Bob doesn't want to overpay if he can avoid it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering Alice's minimum price.  This is a significant move, showing Bob's serious intent to purchase the product. It's a high-risk, high-reward strategy. If Alice accepts, Bob gets the product at his maximum price. If Alice rejects, Bob will likely have to buy from John in the next round to avoid losing out.  This is a final attempt to negotiate a favorable price before resorting to the backup option."
