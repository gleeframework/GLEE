"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000, but lower than my minimum of $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive message:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for Bob, making it more appealing.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm ending with an open question to invite Bob to respond and begin the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize profit while ensuring a sale.  I'm starting with a high offer and am prepared to lower it gradually if needed, while keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $7,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. It's also below the value of $8,000 he placed on the product, which suggests he might be willing to pay more.  

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum. I want to see if I can push Bob closer to my desired price point before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $7,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing a counteroffer of $9,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $7,000. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise. 
* **Reasoning:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a positive tone, emphasizing a ""fair deal"" to encourage Bob to consider my offer. 

**Strategy:**

By offering a counter-proposal close to the middle ground, I aim to gauge Bob's willingness to compromise and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price within a few more rounds. I'm still prioritizing a higher price while keeping the option to sell to John if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $8,500. I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum price of $12,000, it's still significantly below what I'd like to get. Bob's offer is also very close to his initial valuation of $8,000, suggesting he might be willing to go a bit higher.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer, aiming to close the gap between our positions.  However, I'm aware of the limited rounds, so I need to be strategic in my counteroffers. If I can't get a price closer to $10,000, I'll seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $8,800. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $8,800, which is a small but significant increase from Bob's last offer of $8,500. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not going to give up much more ground.
* **Reasoning:** I'm emphasizing ""compromise"" and ""value"" to make my offer seem fair and reasonable.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm asking Bob's opinion to encourage further discussion.

**Strategy:**

With only 5 rounds remaining, I need to be decisive. I'm trying to find a sweet spot where I can get a decent price while also ensuring a deal. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to making a decision, but $8,800 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,200, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, so I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,200 is closer to my minimum of $12,000, it's still significantly below what I'd like to get. The remaining rounds are limited, and I'm not willing to compromise much further. I believe Bob might be willing to increase his offer slightly, considering he's expressed interest in the product and has already moved up from his initial valuation.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a final counteroffer, hoping to reach a compromise. If this fails, I'll likely sell to John in the next round, as it's unlikely I can get a much better price from Bob in the remaining rounds."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I truly appreciate your interest in the product. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and I believe it's a great opportunity for you. Let's close this deal now. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $8,500, exactly halfway between my previous offer of $8,800 and Bob's offer of $8,200. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still holding onto a decent profit.
* **Urgency:** I'm creating a sense of urgency by suggesting that this is a ""great opportunity"" and encouraging Bob to close the deal now. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and friendly tone to make the negotiation less adversarial.

**Strategy:**

With only 3 rounds left, I'm making a final push to get a price that's closer to my desired profit. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll almost certainly sell to John in the next round. I'm betting that the ""meet-in-the-middle"" approach will appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit stuck on the price. I'm willing to meet you at $8,300, which is the highest I'm willing to go. If we can agree on that price, I'm ready to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $8,300 is only $200 higher than his previous offer, and it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  With only two rounds left, the likelihood of reaching a significantly better price with Bob is very low.

**Strategy:**

I've reached the point where the potential gains from continuing to negotiate with Bob are outweighed by the risk of getting a lower price or not closing the deal at all. It's more advantageous to sell to John at this point, as it guarantees me my minimum desired price of $12,000."
