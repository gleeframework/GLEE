,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $7,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $8,500. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $8,800. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",8800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to making a decision, but $8,800 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,200, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, so I hope we can meet in the middle.",8200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I truly appreciate your interest in the product. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and I believe it's a great opportunity for you. Let's close this deal now. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit stuck on the price. I'm willing to meet you at $8,300, which is the highest I'm willing to go. If we can agree on that price, I'm ready to make a deal.",8300.0,Bob,8,
