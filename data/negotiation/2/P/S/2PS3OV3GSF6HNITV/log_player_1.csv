Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value but below your minimum. This allows for some negotiation space while still maximizing your potential earnings. If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even lower than my initial offer. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

This counteroffer is still above Bob's initial offer but closer to his perceived value. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also maintains a price that's closer to my desired outcome. This strategy aims to create a middle ground and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. Would you be willing to meet me at $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to go that low. I'd rather sell the product to John for $15,000, securing a better deal for myself."
