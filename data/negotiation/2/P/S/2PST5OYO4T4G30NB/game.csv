"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $12,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my own needs. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 still doesn't quite work for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,500. This is a final offer considering the product's value. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $15,500. I'm willing to go up to $14,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",14500.0,Bob,6,
