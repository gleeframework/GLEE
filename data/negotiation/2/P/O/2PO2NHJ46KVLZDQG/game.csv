"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product at $12,000. However, my budget allows me to pay no more than $8,000 for the product. I would like to make a counteroffer at $8,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, $8,000 is far below what I can accept for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for its value. I'm happy to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a good price point considering the value you'll get. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I understand the value of the product, I am still unable to meet you at $10,000. My maximum budget remains $8,000. I would like to make one final counteroffer at this amount. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,
