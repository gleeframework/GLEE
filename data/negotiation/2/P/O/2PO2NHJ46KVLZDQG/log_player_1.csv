This offer starts with a price that is a good compromise - it's significantly lower than my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also sets the tone for a positive interaction with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product at $12,000. However, my budget allows me to pay no more than $8,000 for the product. I would like to make a counteroffer at $8,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I will not sell the product for less than my minimum value.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, $8,000 is far below what I can accept for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for its value. I'm happy to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a good price point considering the value you'll get. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I understand the value of the product, I am still unable to meet you at $10,000. My maximum budget remains $8,000. I would like to make one final counteroffer at this amount. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:

Bob's final offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I appreciate his persistence, I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum value.  I'll sell to John instead, as he's willing to pay my desired price."
