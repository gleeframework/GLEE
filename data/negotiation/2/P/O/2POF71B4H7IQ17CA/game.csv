"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $12000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the middle ground. How about $11500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11500 is closer, but still a little high for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to offer $11000 for the product. It's a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not quite comfortable with $11000. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $11250? It's a small step closer to my target, but I think it's a fair price for the value the product brings.",11250.0,Alice,5,
