Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $19,000, which reflects its true value."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can aim higher with Bob. Starting at $19,000 allows room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price.
* **Confident Positioning:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the higher price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves space for Bob to negotiate down, potentially reaching a price that's still very profitable for you.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have some time and flexibility. If you need to sell the product quickly, a lower initial offer might be more suitable."
