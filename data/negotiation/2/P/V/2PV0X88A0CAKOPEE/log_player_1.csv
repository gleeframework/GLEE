"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a bold move, but it gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob doesn't accept.  I'm also aware of John's offer of $1,000,000 as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is my safety net with John, I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm dropping the price to $1,250,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing flexibility. I believe this is a fair compromise while still leaving some room for potential future concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price. I don't want to risk losing this deal and having to sell to John for $1,000,000.  Accepting this offer ensures a good profit."
