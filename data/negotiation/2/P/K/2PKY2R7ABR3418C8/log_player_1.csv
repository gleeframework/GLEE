Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value ($10,000). This allows room for negotiation and ensures I'm not selling myself short.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $13,000 is a decent price, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable number."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm countering with $14,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping to show flexibility while still aiming for a price that's closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $13,500 is close enough to my desired price point that it's worth accepting.  Further negotiation might get me a few hundred more, but the risk of him walking away or me having to sell to John for $10,000 isn't worth it."
