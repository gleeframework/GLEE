"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1000000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $800000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $600000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $600000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $700000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to you is $1000000. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $700000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $600000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",600000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $650000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's worth to you is $1000000. What do you think?",650000.0,Alice,5,
