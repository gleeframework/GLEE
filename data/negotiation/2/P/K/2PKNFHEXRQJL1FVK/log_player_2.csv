# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1000000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still above what I'm willing to pay.  I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $800,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 600000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $600000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $700000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to you is $1000000. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still a bit high, but it's closer to what I'm willing to pay. I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price in the next round. I'm confident I can get a better deal if I continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $700,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $600,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 600000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $650000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's worth to you is $1000000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $650,000 is a good price, considering her initial offer was $800,000. It's still a good deal for me, even though it's above my original counteroffer of $600,000.  It's unlikely she'll go any lower, and I don't want to risk losing the product and having to pay John $1,000,000."
