Bob's offer is lower than what I'm willing to accept, but it's still closer to my desired price than the minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I will reject the offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $13,000 to Bob. This is a compromise between his offer and my desired price.  It's a good middle ground that could lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still too low.  I've been negotiating for a while now, and I'm not sure if he's willing to go higher.  To avoid the risk of losing the deal entirely, I'm going to sell to John for a guaranteed $15,000."
