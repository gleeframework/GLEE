Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'd like to propose a deal where I pay $1,900,000 and you include some additional features or support that I've been wanting. This would make the product more valuable to me and make the deal more worthwhile. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:

{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking around the $1,900,000 mark and now wants additional features added for the same price. This indicates potential for a higher sale price without giving in to extras.  We're still in the early stages of negotiation and have room to nudge him higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand the desire for additional features, but those come at a cost that would need to be reflected in the price. If you're willing to meet me at $1,950,000, I'm happy to close the deal today.  This seems like a fair compromise to ensure we both walk away satisfied."", 
""product_price"": 1950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're acknowledging his desire for added features but holding firm on price without completely shutting down the possibility.  A slight increase from his offer to $1,950,000 keeps us in the negotiation while still aiming for a strong profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $1,850,000 for the product, and I'd like to reiterate my interest in the additional features or support. I think this is a fair price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now going backwards on price while still pushing for extras. This signals that he may be getting ready to walk away or settle soon. We need to hold firm to signal that we're serious about the value while still leaving room for a final counter."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be upfront. $1,900,000 is my absolute lowest price for the product as is.  At this point, it's really a take-it-or-leave-it situation.  I believe it's a fair offer considering the value it brings."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation window. This offer makes it clear this is our final price and creates a sense of urgency.
* **No Extras:** We're firmly rejecting the additional features request by sticking to the price without budging on extras.
* **Strong Position:**  We're still above our fallback option of John, leaving room for Bob to potentially counter with a slightly higher offer in the final round if he's truly committed."
