"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer is still quite high. There's room to negotiate a better price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

This counteroffer provides a significant decrease from Alice's initial offer, attempting to move closer to my desired price range while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice moved closer to my price range, it's still a bit higher than John's offer.  There's room for one more counter-offer before accepting John's deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

This counteroffer matches John's price, putting pressure on Alice to either accept this offer or potentially lose the sale."
