"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $7,000 is significantly below my minimum.  How about we split the difference at $8,500? This gives you a good deal and allows me to get closer to my desired price.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I see where you're coming from.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,750?  That's a fair compromise.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $7,750 is still too low. Let's meet in the middle again, at $8,250. It's a fair price for both of us and ensures we can finalize the deal.",8250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I need to be realistic. My budget is firm, and I can't go higher than $7,900.  This is a very competitive offer, considering I have other options.",7900.0,Bob,6,
