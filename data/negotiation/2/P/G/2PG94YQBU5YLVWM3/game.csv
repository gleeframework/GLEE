"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer you the product for $8,500. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product and allows us both to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $8,200 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $8,300. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and provides a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this transaction and make this happen.  What do you say?",8300.0,Alice,5,
