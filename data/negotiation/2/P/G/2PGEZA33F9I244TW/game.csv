"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and come down to $1,150,000. This price still leaves room for a profitable deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am unable to meet the price of $1,150,000. I would like to propose $1,125,000 as a counteroffer. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while also being fair to both parties.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
