Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $15,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer aims to strike a balance:

* **It's above my minimum value:**  $12,000 is significantly more than my minimum of $8,000, ensuring I get a good profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  The offer is lower than Bob's perceived value, opening up space for him to counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while still maintaining a good chance of closing the deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above my minimum of $8,000, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer of $12,000.  I believe I can push for a better price.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to close the gap and reach a more profitable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $11,000. How about we try $10,500? I think this is a reasonable compromise. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:**  $10,500 is still above my minimum of $8,000, ensuring a profit.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Negotiations can be time-consuming, and I've already made concessions.  
* **Risk of Lower Offer:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk that he might lower his offer further, or I might have to sell to John for a lower price. 

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer of $10,500 is the most sensible decision. It's a good compromise that secures a reasonable profit without prolonging the negotiation or risking a lower offer."
