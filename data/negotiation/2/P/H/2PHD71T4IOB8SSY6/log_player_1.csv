Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum and Bob's maximum. Any deal needs to bridge this gap.

**Strategy**

Since Bob's perceived value is lower than your minimum, you need to either:

1. **Convince Bob the product is worth more:**  Highlight features or benefits Bob might not be fully considering. This is difficult given the price difference.
2. **Accept a lower price:** This is the more realistic option. However, you want to maximize your profit.

**The Offer**

Here's a possible offer, leaning towards accepting a lower price while still aiming high:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe its unique features would be highly valuable to your business. I'm willing to make this attractive for you with a price of $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Negotiable:** This offer is significantly above Bob's perceived value, but the message implies you're open to negotiation.
* **Emphasizes Value:**  It subtly reminds Bob of the potential benefits without being overly pushy.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start even lower (closer to $1,300,000). 
* **Time Sensitivity:** If you need to sell quickly, a lower price might be more appealing.

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate and adjust your price based on Bob's response."
