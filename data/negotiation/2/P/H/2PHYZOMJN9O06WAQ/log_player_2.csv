"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our premium product. Given its immense value and rarity, we believe it's worth more than $1,200,000 to you. However, considering the current market conditions and the unique circumstances surrounding this item, I am extending an offer to purchase it for $950,000. This represents a significant discount compared to its true value, providing you with an exceptional return on investment. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's flowery language tries to convince you of the deal's value, the offer of $950,000 is still significantly higher than your maximum budget and John's offer. By rejecting this offer, you can try to negotiate a better price with Alice or proceed to buy from John at a lower cost."
