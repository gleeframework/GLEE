{""product_price"": 950000}
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a point that is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It acknowledges that the product is valuable to Bob, but also demonstrates that you are not afraid to walk away if you don't get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to go with John's offer, there's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between your previous offer and his offer. It shows you are willing to negotiate, while still maintaining a price that is closer to your desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still lower than what you are willing to accept. While you can continue negotiating, the risk of further concessions and the time investment are not worth it, especially considering John is offering a secure price that is close to your minimum acceptable value."
