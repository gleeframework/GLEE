"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $700,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than the product's worth to me. I'm willing to negotiate further to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $820,000. This is still a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than what the product is worth to you. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 820000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that the product holds value, but I need to stay within a certain budget. How about $760,000? That's a significant jump from my previous offer and demonstrates my willingness to reach a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $760,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $760,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $760,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below the value of the product for me. I want to see if I can squeeze out a little more before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate it.  How about we split the difference? $800,000 would be a fair price, allowing both of us to walk away satisfied with the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
