"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since your maximum budget is $1,000,000 and John is offering the product for that price, it's the most logical choice.  There's no need to negotiate with Alice if you can get the product for the same price immediately."
