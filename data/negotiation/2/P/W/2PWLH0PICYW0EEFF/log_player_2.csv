Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you have a budget in mind, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table.

Round 5

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make it worth my while. I'm counteroffering at $13,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has signaled that $13,200 is her absolute lowest price.  While continuing to negotiate *might* yield a slightly better price, it's risky.  Alice could hold firm, and we'd be forced to either accept a higher price or go with John anyway.  Since we have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $10,000, it makes the most sense to secure that price now rather than risk getting stuck with a worse deal."
