"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $18,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $11,000? I think that's a fair starting point.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you have a budget in mind, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. How about we settle at $12,500? That feels like a reasonable compromise to me.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $14,000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is the lowest I can go while still making a decent profit.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $13,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be open to considering $12,800? I'm trying to make this work within my budget.",12800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make it worth my while. I'm counteroffering at $13,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement.",13200.0,Alice,7,
