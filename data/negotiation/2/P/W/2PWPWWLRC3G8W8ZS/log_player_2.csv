"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than the product's value to her ($800,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.  As Bob, I want to save as much money as possible. It's likely Alice will be willing to go lower, and rejecting the offer opens the door to counter-offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  Given the product's value to you, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $900,000, which is closer to my desired price point. While I could try for a lower price, it's likely Alice won't budge much further.  Accepting her offer ensures I get the product for a decent price, saving me $100,000 compared to buying from John."
