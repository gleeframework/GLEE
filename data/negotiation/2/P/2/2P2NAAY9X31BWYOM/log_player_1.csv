"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1100000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to secure a good price while leaving room for negotiation.  This price is still below Bob's perceived value, giving him incentive to negotiate, but it's also significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is higher than what John would pay, it's still significantly below my target price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, showing flexibility.  $1,050,000 is still a good price for me, and it's closer to Bob's offer, making it more likely he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I still believe we can reach a higher price.  I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can find a mutually acceptable solution."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}

I'm increasing my offer slightly from Bob's last offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise. This price is still within my acceptable range and could convince Bob to accept."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, we're nearing the halfway point and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  $925,000 is a good price, considering Bob's value for the product."
