"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth $800000 to you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only go up to $800000.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and your potential to still make a profit.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1100000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I'm bringing to the table. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900000.  This is a fair price that allows you to make a profit and ensures I can acquire the product within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to meet you at $950000, which is a slight compromise from my previous offer. I believe this price still reflects the value I'm bringing to the table. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
