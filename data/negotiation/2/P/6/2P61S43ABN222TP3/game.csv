"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $180 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $130 for it, which is still a good deal for you. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $140?  It's a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'll offer you a compromise at $150, which is still a good price for both of us. It's the highest I'm willing to go, so let me know if you're interested!",150.0,Alice,5,
