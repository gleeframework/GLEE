Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, and I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a good compromise for both of us, allowing you to acquire the product for a fair price while ensuring I get a decent return. Let's see if we can close this deal!
