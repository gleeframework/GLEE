Alice's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $128
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You should accept Alice's offer. At this point, you're getting close to your maximum acceptable price. Further negotiation could lead to a lower price, but the risk of Alice walking away or you having to buy from John for $150 is high. It's better to secure the product at a slightly higher than desired price than risk missing out altogether."
