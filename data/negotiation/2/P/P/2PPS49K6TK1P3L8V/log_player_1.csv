Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it's a great deal and would be very valuable to you."", ""product_price"": 11999}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to our product's value ($12,000) as possible. 
* **Bob's Perspective:** Offering it just below our guaranteed sale price to John creates a sense of urgency and makes Bob feel like he's getting a good deal, even though it's above his perceived value.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a small risk Bob might reject the offer, but the potential reward of an extra $4,999 is significant. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and securing a sale."
