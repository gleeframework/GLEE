Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm confident this product is a valuable asset for you, given its potential to deliver significant returns.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,000,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given its potential, I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This would still allow you a significant profit while leaving me room to achieve my desired return. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price.  While $900,000 is tempting, I believe I can do better.  Let's see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to be flexible. Let's split the difference. I'm offering the product for $950,000. This would still give you a substantial profit margin while allowing me to achieve a more favorable outcome.  I'm confident this price is fair and reflects the value of the product to both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm getting closer to a price that works for me.  $925,000 feels more reasonable given the value I see in this product.  This would allow both of us to walk away satisfied. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, this offer is getting closer to my desired range and is within my acceptable margin. It's better to secure a deal with Bob now rather than risk losing him and having to settle with John."
