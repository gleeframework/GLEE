"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm confident this product is a valuable asset for you, given its potential to deliver significant returns.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,000,000.  This represents a substantial opportunity for you while still ensuring a fair return for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  It's above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation is possible:** You have 10 rounds and Alice is likely to negotiate. 
* **John's price is a benchmark:** You know the absolute maximum you're willing to pay. 

By rejecting, you initiate negotiation and see if Alice is willing to lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given its potential, I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This would still allow you a significant profit while leaving me room to achieve my desired return."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing your serious intent to negotiate.
* **Focus on Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's potential, aligning with Alice's initial pitch and framing your offer as a win-win.
* **Leaves Room for Adjustment:** $900,000 is still within your budget, leaving space for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to be flexible. Let's split the difference. I'm offering the product for $950,000. This would still give you a substantial profit margin while allowing me to achieve a more favorable outcome.  I'm confident this price is fair and reflects the value of the product to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still high:**  It's closer to your budget, but still leaves you with a lower profit margin.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** There are 7 rounds left, and Alice is showing flexibility. 
* **John's price is a benchmark:** You can always fall back to John if you can't get a better deal with Alice.

By rejecting, you keep the pressure on Alice to lower her price further. You can try to meet in the middle again in your next counteroffer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm getting closer to a price that works for me.  $925,000 feels more reasonable given the value I see in this product.  This would allow both of us to walk away satisfied. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer is halfway between your previous counteroffer of $900,000 and Alice's latest offer of $950,000. 
* **Emphasizing Mutual Gain:**  The message focuses on the potential for both parties to achieve a satisfying outcome.
* **Staying within Budget:** This offer is still within your budget and allows for potential wiggle room.

This counteroffer shows a continued willingness to negotiate while demonstrating your firm stance on reaching a price that benefits both parties."
