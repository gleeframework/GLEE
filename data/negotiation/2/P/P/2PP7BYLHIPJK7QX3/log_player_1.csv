Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 allows for a potential counter-offer from Bob while still keeping you above your minimum. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have the security of John as a buyer, ensuring you won't go below $120. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob and securing a guaranteed sale with John."
