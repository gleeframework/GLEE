{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but not so high that it's immediately unreasonable. I'm leaving room for negotiation, but still aiming to get as much as possible.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter-offer and see how the negotiation unfolds. I'll also keep in mind the option of selling to John for $10,000 as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $10,000 for it. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. While $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm confident I can get closer to my initial offer of $11,000.  I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? It's a fair price that still allows me to make a profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am unable to meet you at $10,500. My maximum budget remains at $10,000. I hope we can find a mutually acceptable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

```

Bob has been firm on his $10,000 offer.  It seems like we've hit a stalemate.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial price,  selling to John for $10,000 is a guaranteed deal, and it's my minimum acceptable price.  It's time to move on and secure the sale."
