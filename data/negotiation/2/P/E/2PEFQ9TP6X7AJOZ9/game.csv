"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the product's value to me. However, $900,000 is still a bit high. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is a fair price considering your value and my budget.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll find it's still a great deal.
