"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's truly one-of-a-kind and I believe it will be a valuable asset for you. I'm starting with an asking price of $1,200,000, reflecting its exceptional value. I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product is valuable, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we bring it down to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still gives you a significant benefit, and it's a fair reflection of the product's worth.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  To be honest, $1,000,000 is the very top of my budget for this, so I'd be willing to meet you at $900,000. If that doesn't work, I might have to explore other options.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value your interest, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to make a final compromise.  How about we settle on $950,000? This price reflects the unique value of the product and allows us both to reach a fair agreement. ",950000.0,Alice,5,
