Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product and the value you've expressed it has to you.

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his maximum budget.  It's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $8,000, ensuring he stays within his budget and avoids further negotiation."
