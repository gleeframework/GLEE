"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $12,000. I think it's a great price considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal than $12,000.  The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her value of $8,000, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Strategic Value:**  Offering $9,500 establishes a clear starting point for the negotiation, leaving room for Alice to counter without feeling like she's giving away too much. 
* **Potential for Compromise:**  This counteroffer leaves some space for Alice to offer a price closer to Bob's target without feeling like she's losing out."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you think $12,000 is a bit high, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:**  Alice's offer of $11,000 is still within Bob's budget and a significant savings compared to buying from John for $15,000.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While a counteroffer might potentially bring the price down further, the risk of Alice walking away from the deal is higher.  
* **Compromise:**  Alice has already moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer. Accepting the offer demonstrates a willingness to compromise and reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
