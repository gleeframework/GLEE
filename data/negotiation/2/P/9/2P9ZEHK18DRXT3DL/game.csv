"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $1,600,000? This still gives you a significant advantage, and it allows me to get closer to what the product is worth to me. Let me know your thoughts.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,350,000 for the product, which is a fair compromise considering its value to both of us. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both parties.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your coming down in price, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.
