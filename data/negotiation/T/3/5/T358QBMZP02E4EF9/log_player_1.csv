Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I value the product at $800,000, so I won't go below that.
* **Bob's maximum:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so he won't go above that.
* **Negotiation strategy:**  By offering $950,000, I leave some room for negotiation,  but I'm still aiming for a price significantly higher than my minimum. This gives Bob a sense that the offer is reasonable, while still being beneficial to me. 
* **John as backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer ensures I have a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $700,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $800,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable,  there's still room for negotiation. I can counter with a price closer to my desired range and see if he's willing to compromise.
* **John is a backup:** Having John as an option ensures that if negotiations with Bob break down completely, I can still secure a sale at my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  Bob offered $700,000, and my minimum is $800,000. This counteroffer of $850,000 splits the difference, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Still above minimum:** I am still above my minimum value, but it's a substantial concession to potentially entice Bob back to the negotiation table.
* **Maintaining leverage:** While I'm lowering my price, I'm not going down to his initial offer.  This shows that I am serious about selling to him, but I am also not desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $650,000 is far below my minimum value of $800,000. Accepting would be a significant financial loss.
* **Negotiation is unlikely:** Bob's continued low offers suggest he might be unwilling to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  It's unlikely he'll budge much further.
* **John is a safe alternative:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and avoids further potentially fruitless negotiation with Bob. 

It's better to take the sure thing with John than risk further haggling with Bob and potentially ending up with a worse outcome."
