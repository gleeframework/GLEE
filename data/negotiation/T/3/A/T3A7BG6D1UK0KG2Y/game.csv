"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I am willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. Therefore, I propose an offer of $105 for the product. This is a fair compromise that allows you to acquire the product at a reasonable price while still providing a good margin for me. Please let me know if this works for you.",105.0,Alice,3,
