Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me right now.  I'd be willing to purchase for $800,000.  Let me know what you think.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. It shows you're serious about making a deal. To be frank, $1,100,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you consider $900,000? That would make this a much easier decision for me.
