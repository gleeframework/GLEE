"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations to find a mutually beneficial price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me right now.  I'd be willing to purchase for $800,000.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit lower than my initial asking price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'd like to counteroffer at $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my original price, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. It shows you're serious about making a deal. To be frank, $1,100,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you consider $900,000? That would make this a much easier decision for me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's value, I'd like to counteroffer at $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I believe is reasonable, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close.  I'm ready to agree to a deal, but $1,050,000 is pushing it.  How about we settle this right now for $975,000?  That's a fair compromise, and we both walk away happy.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to reach a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $975,000. Considering the product's value, I'd like to counteroffer at $1,025,000. This is a reasonable compromise that I believe is fair, and I'm willing to make a final concession. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
