This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a good profit, but I'm also aware that I can sell to John for $10,000 if the negotiation doesn't work out. We'll see how Bob responds and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired profit. I'll counter with a price that's closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to meet Bob halfway, offering $14,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but still aiming for a good profit. Let's see if this convinces him."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a bit more, $13,000 is a good profit and significantly better than selling to John. It's time to close this deal."
