{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

We've reached a point where the negotiation is getting tighter.  Offering $120 shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining your budget.  It also signals that you are serious about buying the product from Alice, but are not willing to go much higher.  This could encourage Alice to make a counteroffer closer to your price."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $140 is significantly higher than what you're willing to pay. With only a few rounds remaining, the chances of a successful negotiation are slim. It's more advantageous to buy from John at $100, ensuring you get the product at your desired price."
