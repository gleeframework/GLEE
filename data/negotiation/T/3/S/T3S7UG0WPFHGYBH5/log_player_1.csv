"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to make a reasonable profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob.  $9,000 is too low, and I think I can get closer to my target price of $12,000."

While I'd prefer to get closer to $10,500, $9,500 is still a decent price and is only $1,500 below my target. It's also significantly better than selling to John for $8,000.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
