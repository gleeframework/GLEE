I'm starting with a counteroffer that's a bit lower than what I'm willing to pay, but still within a reasonable range. Hopefully, Alice will see that I'm serious about buying the product and be willing to negotiate."

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price again.  I'm getting close to my limit but I'm willing to risk it to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 148} 
``` 

I'm going to make one last counteroffer to see if we can come to a compromise. This is pretty close to my limit, but I think it's still a fair price."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
``` 

While I would prefer to get the product for a lower price, Alice is clearly not willing to go lower than $152. I'm not willing to risk it and potentially go through more rounds of negotiation. I'll go ahead and buy the product from John for $150."
