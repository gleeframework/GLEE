"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the conversation at a price of $1500000. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1500000 is far too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product, as that's the maximum value I see in it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob, but I believe the product's value goes beyond what you're offering. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. My revised offer is $1350000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1350000 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $1225000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the deal.",1225000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not convinced we're at the right price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. My revised offer is $1300000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
