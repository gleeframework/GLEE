"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but the price is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we settle at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value your interest, $850,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price reflects the product's unique value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's work together to find common ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $950,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something more manageable. Would you consider $900,000? I'm hoping we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
