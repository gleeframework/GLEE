Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

This is my initial offer to Bob. It's a significant amount above my minimum, but I'm hoping to gauge his interest and potentially negotiate a higher price.  I'm also aware of John's offer, so I have a fallback option if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm not satisfied with it. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I'm still hopeful I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that both of us can agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a significant improvement over his previous offer and is getting closer to my desired price. Accepting this offer is a good outcome, as it's well above my minimum and avoids the risk of further negotiation that could potentially result in a lower price. Selling to John would only net me $1,000,000, so accepting Bob's offer is the more profitable choice."
