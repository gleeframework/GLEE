"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $9,000 is lower than John's price of $10,000, it's still above Alice's value of $8,000. There's a chance you could get a better price by rejecting this offer, forcing Alice to potentially reconsider.  If she doesn't budge, you can always buy from John as a backup."
