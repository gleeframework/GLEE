"Thank you for offering the unique product. I appreciate the value and rarity you mentioned. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $900000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $875000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value and rarity, while also being more in line with your budget constraints. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand the value and rarity of the product, I'm still constrained by my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $860000. This amount strikes a balance between respecting the product's worth and staying within my financial limits.",860000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go down to $860000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm proposing $870000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value and rarity. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",870000.0,Alice,5,
