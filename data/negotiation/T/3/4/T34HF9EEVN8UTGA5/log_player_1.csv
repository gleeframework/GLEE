Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a suitable offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Your Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,000,000.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum value creates a win-win situation.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. I know it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it at $1,150,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You acknowledge the product's value to Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $1,150,000 gives Bob a $50,000 discount (from his perceived value), making it an enticing offer.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** By mentioning other interested parties and making it a ""one-time offer,"" you create a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly.

**Outcome**

This strategy gives you a high chance of securing a sale at $1,150,000, a significant profit above your minimum."
