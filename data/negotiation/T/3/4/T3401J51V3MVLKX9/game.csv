"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the price you've suggested, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $950,000 is still below my desired price point. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if this works for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I am still constrained by my budget. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget limitations, but $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. To make this a mutually beneficial deal, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,150,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Please let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
