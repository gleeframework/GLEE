Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is quite high. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,200,000. This is my best price, and it's still a good deal for you considering your asking price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  That's a substantial discount from my original offer, and still a fair price for a product worth more to you than the price I'm asking. Let's try to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,300,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that.  I'm going to come down to $1,550,000.  This is my final offer before I consider other options.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than your budget, and you have some room for negotiation. While she claims this is her final offer, it's likely she's willing to go lower to close the deal.  It's worth trying one more counteroffer before considering buying from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but unfortunately, $1,550,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I truly believe it's a fair price for both of us. It's a win-win situation.  I'm hoping we can finalize this deal in the next round."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
