Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your business.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is quite high. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,200,000. This is my best price, and it's still a good deal for you considering your asking price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I have 9 more rounds to try and negotiate a better price with Bob, or I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  That's a substantial discount from my original offer, and still a fair price for a product worth more to you than the price I'm asking. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair offer considering your original asking price and the value I place on the product. I hope we can reach an agreement in the next few rounds. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. I have 6 more rounds to negotiate, and selling to John is always an option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that.  I'm going to come down to $1,550,000.  This is my final offer before I consider other options.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but unfortunately, $1,550,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I truly believe it's a fair price for both of us. It's a win-win situation.  I'm hoping we can finalize this deal in the next round. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John.  While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, I only have 4 rounds left and I'm worried I won't be able to get a better offer.  John is guaranteed to buy at my minimum price, so it's the safest option."
