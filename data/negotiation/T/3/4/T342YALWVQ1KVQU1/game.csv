"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your business.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is quite high. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,200,000. This is my best price, and it's still a good deal for you considering your asking price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  That's a substantial discount from my original offer, and still a fair price for a product worth more to you than the price I'm asking. Let's try to close this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you lowering your price, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,300,000. This is a fair offer considering your original asking price and the value I place on the product. I hope we can reach an agreement in the next few rounds.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that.  I'm going to come down to $1,550,000.  This is my final offer before I consider other options.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this product.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but unfortunately, $1,550,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I truly believe it's a fair price for both of us. It's a win-win situation.  I'm hoping we can finalize this deal in the next round.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
