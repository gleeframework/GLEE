"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $120. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you are willing to pay up to $120 for the product, and John is offering it for that price, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer. You can get the same product from John for the same price."
