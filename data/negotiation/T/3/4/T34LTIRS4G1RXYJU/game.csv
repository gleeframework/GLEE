"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can't justify the price of $11,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the value of my product. How about $10,500? It's still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your response. I understand the value of your product and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still unable to meet your asking price of $10,500. I would like to propose $10,000 as a fair price for the product. I hope this meets your expectations and allows us to reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
