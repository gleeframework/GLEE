Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm opening with a price significantly higher than my minimum value. This allows for negotiation and potentially a good profit.
* **Understanding Bob:** I don't know Bob's valuation, so a high offer might deter him. However, it also sets a high starting point for the negotiation.
* **John as backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer provides a safety net, allowing me to be more aggressive with Bob. If the negotiation fails, I can still secure $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** Even though it's above my minimum value, it's still far below my initial offer and potentially my target price.
* **Room for negotiation:**  Rejecting allows me to counteroffer and potentially secure a better price.
* **John's offer is a backup:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $1,000,000, ensuring I don't lose out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating willingness to negotiate but still maintaining a good profit margin. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  This offer is still above my minimum value and above John's offer, giving me some negotiating power.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's seriousness and potentially find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is at my minimum:** This means there's no further room for negotiation to increase the price.
* **John's offer is equal:**  John is offering the same amount as Bob.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Selling to John ensures a guaranteed sale at my minimum value. There's no risk of further negotiation failures. 
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could be time-consuming and potentially lead to a lower price or even a failed sale."
