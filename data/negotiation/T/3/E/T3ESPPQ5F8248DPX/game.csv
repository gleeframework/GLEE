"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $120 is a bit too high for me. How about $100? It's still a good price for you, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $110? It's still a great deal for you, and I think we can come to an agreement.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $105? That's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $108. It's still a great deal for you, and I think we're getting close to a mutually beneficial agreement.",108.0,Alice,5,
