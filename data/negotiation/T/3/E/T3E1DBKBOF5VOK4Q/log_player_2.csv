# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* Alice's offer of $900,000 is significantly less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. 
* Accepting this offer allows you to save $300,000 compared to buying from John. 
* Even though the product's worth to Alice is $1,000,000, it's irrelevant to your decision as you're focused on getting the best price for yourself."
