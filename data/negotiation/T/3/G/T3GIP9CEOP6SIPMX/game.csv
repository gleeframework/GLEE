"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000. I'm confident that this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,600,000 is significantly outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is still a very attractive price considering its value. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to be flexible, how about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a fair compromise given my budget and the potential of this product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
