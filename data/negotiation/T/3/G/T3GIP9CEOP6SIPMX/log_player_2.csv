# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000. I'm confident that this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's definitely worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to be flexible, how about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price point. There's room for further negotiation, and it's worth seeing if Alice is willing to go lower."
