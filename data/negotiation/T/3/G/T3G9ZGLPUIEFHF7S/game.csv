"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now willing to sell the product for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I see you're trying to get closer to the price, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I'm not going any lower. I'm willing to throw in a small concession: I'll include a 1-year warranty on the product, which is worth $500. This way, you'll get a great deal and I'll still get a fair price. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
