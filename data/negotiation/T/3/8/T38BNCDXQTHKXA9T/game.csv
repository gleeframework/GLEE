"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $150 to you, so I'm offering it to you for $125. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. Let me know what you think!",125.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to spend closer to $100.  Would you be willing to come down to $110? ",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your offer, $110 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $115. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a great deal for you. Let's close this deal!",115.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $115 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $112.50? That would be a great deal for both of us.",112.5,Bob,4,
