Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think you'll be interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $15,000. It's worth significantly more to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  $15,000 is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation while still being above your minimum acceptable value of $10,000. 
* **Focus on value:** The message emphasizes the product's worth and highlights your willingness to negotiate. This makes the offer more appealing to Bob while establishing a strong starting position.
* **Open to counteroffers:**  The message clearly states that you're willing to negotiate, inviting Bob to counter without seeming desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value to you, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $14000 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is only slightly lower than my initial offer. I'm still confident that I can get closer to my desired price.  

* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can push for a higher price.
* **Avoiding Loss:** Accepting Bob's offer would result in a lower sale price than my initial offer.  
* **Value to Bob:**  Bob's interest suggests the product holds some value to him. I believe I can use this to my advantage in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above that price point. How about $14,500? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be worth it to you in the long run. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable compromise:** $14,500 is a halfway point between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still securing a better price than Bob's offer.
* **Focus on value:** I emphasize the long-term value of the product to encourage Bob to see it as a worthwhile investment. 
* **Maintain a positive tone:** The message is friendly and positive, creating a more cooperative environment for continued negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product, I am willing to pay $14200 for it. This price aligns closely with my budget while still offering a reasonable profit margin for you. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  While $14,200 is still a bit lower than my desired price, it's very close to my acceptable minimum of $10,000. 
* **Potential for Delay:**  Continuing to negotiate risks delaying the sale and potentially losing Bob's interest altogether. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  The longer the negotiation goes on, the more time and effort I'm investing, which could be better spent elsewhere. 
* **Security:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale above my minimum acceptable value and avoids the risk of potentially ending up with John's lower offer."
