"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its true value to me and still leaves you with a profit margin. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal compared to the product's true value, it's still above Bob's ideal price of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's meet halfway and see if we can finalize this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to his $10,000 target. While $11,000 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and gives Bob another chance to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still not quite there yet. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,750?  That feels like a good compromise for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,250, which is a fair compromise considering my own costs. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, the negotiation is becoming a bit too close for comfort for Bob.  While $11,250 is a better price than before, it's still a bit higher than Bob's target of $10,000. Since Bob has a guaranteed alternative with John at $10,000, it's in his best interest to stop the negotiation with Alice and buy the product from John.  This ensures he gets the product at his desired price."
