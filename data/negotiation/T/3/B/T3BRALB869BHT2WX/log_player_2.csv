"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $9,500. I believe it presents significant value at this price, considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is better than $10,000, it's still above Bob's ideal price. Rejecting allows Bob to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is still above your value for the product.  Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is cutting it a bit close for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  It's a fair price that reflects the value it brings to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$9,000 is a good compromise:** It's in the middle of Bob's previous offer ($8,500) and Alice's previous offer ($9,500).
* **It's still a good deal for Bob:** $9,000 is less than what he would pay John ($10,000).
* **Negotiating further might risk losing the deal:** Alice might not budge further, and Bob could end up paying John's price."
