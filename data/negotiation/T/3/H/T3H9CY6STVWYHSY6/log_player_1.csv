Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,500. This is a good starting point because it's slightly above Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation if necessary. It also keeps me significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, allowing me to potentially reach a good compromise while still maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While it's tempting to accept, it's better to keep negotiating and see if we can get closer to my goal. I will reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $14,000. This is still a good price for me, as it's above my minimum acceptable price. However, it also shows some willingness to compromise and potentially reach a deal with Bob. This should keep the negotiation moving forward without giving up too much on my end."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I could continue negotiating, the potential for a better outcome is limited. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and eliminates further negotiation risk."
