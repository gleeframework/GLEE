"Thanks for showing me the product, Alice! $175 seems a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we split the difference again and settle on $100? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. How about we meet at $115? It's still a bit higher than your offer, but it's closer to what I'm looking for.",115.0,Alice,5,
