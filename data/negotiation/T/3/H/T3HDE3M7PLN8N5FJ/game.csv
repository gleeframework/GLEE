"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm confident that it will exceed your expectations and provide a significant return on your investment.  What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can't justify that price.  I'm willing to pay $850,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $850,000 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate.  To move this forward, I propose a price of $1,900,000. This reflects the true value of the product and its potential for significant returns.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,900,000 is still outside my range.  To make progress, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000. This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While your offer is appealing,  I need to see a number closer to my original ask. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000.  This offer reflects the considerable value this product holds. I'm confident it will be a profitable venture for you.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand your perspective, $1,650,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,250,000. This shows my strong commitment to acquiring this product, but I need to stay within my financial limits. I'm hopeful we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
