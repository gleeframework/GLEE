"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. Would you be interested in that?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we split the difference and settle on $112.50?  I'm really interested in the product, and I think this would be a fair price for both of us.",112.5,Bob,4,
