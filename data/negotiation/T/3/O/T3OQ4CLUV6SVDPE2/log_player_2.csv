"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. $150 is more than his maximum budget of $120. It makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significantly lower counteroffer, aiming to get a better deal. He's aiming for a price that's closer to his maximum budget while still leaving some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. Would you be interested in that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $125 is still slightly above Bob's maximum budget of $120.  While it's closer, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we split the difference and settle on $112.50?  I'm really interested in the product, and I think this would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 112.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is proposing a middle ground price, splitting the difference between his previous offer of $100 and Alice's offer of $125. This shows a willingness to compromise and could potentially be accepted by Alice."
