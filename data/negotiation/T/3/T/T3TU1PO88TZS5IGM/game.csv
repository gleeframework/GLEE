"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $125, which would be $117.50. Would you be willing to consider that?",117.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $117.50 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $122.50.  This is a fair compromise, and it's the best I can do at this point.  What do you say?",122.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $122.50 is a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $117.50 and $122.50, which would be $120. I think this is a fair price considering we're close to the original offer. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,6,
