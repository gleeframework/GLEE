"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and allows me a substantial profit. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This allows you a decent profit while still being a great price for me."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still looking to get a higher price for the product. I'm willing to lower my price slightly to $1050000. This still gives you a significant discount on your estimated value and allows me to make a good profit. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above your desired price point. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can get closer to your target of $950,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make another counteroffer."
