Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase [product name].  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects the significant return on investment you'll see. Let me know your thoughts!"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed. 
* **Justification:**  While the price is high, highlighting the ""value and potential"" provides Bob with a reason for the price, making it seem less arbitrary.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains open for discussion, indicating you're willing to hear Bob's perspective.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still acknowledging Bob's interest and leaving the door open for a successful deal."
