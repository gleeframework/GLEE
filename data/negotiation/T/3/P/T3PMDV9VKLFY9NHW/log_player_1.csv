Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can reach a better agreement. Given that the product is worth $15,000 to me, I would like to propose a price of $16,000. I hope this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is $1,000 less than my initial asking price, but it's still a good deal for me.  It's above my minimum value of $15,000, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the remaining rounds.  It's also possible that Bob will walk away completely if I reject his offer."
