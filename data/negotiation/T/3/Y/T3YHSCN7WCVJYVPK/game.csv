"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $120, which is a great deal. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $60? I think that's a fair price.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $60 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $90?  This is still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, $60 is quite a jump. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a pretty good deal for both of us.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  $75 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $85.  This is a fair price for both of us and a good deal for you.  Let's make this happen.",85.0,Alice,5,
