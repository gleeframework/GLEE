"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,250, so I'm thinking of $8,875. Can you consider that?",8875.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. However, $8,875 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value you'll gain from this product, I'm willing to go down to $9,000. I believe this is a fair compromise. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,750. Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $8,900. This is a very fair price, considering the value of the product to you.  I really hope we can reach an agreement on this.",8900.0,Alice,7,
