Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:**  This is the absolute minimum you'll accept for the product ($1,500,000). 
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **John's Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 if Bob declines.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your reservation price, you have leverage.  You can aim for a price higher than Bob's perceived value, knowing you have a fallback option. However, pushing too aggressively could make Bob walk away.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the long-term benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Opening:** We start above Bob's perceived value and your reservation price. This leaves room for negotiation and creates the perception of value.
* **Justification:**  Vaguely mentioning ""unique value"" and ""long-term benefits"" attempts to reframe the price in a broader context beyond Bob's immediate valuation.
* **Confidence:**  Using phrases like ""pleased to offer"" and ""fair deal""  projects confidence in the offer's value.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator or particularly price-sensitive, you might slightly lower the initial offer.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a positive long-term relationship with Bob is crucial, you might consider a less aggressive opening price.

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and be ready to negotiate strategically to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
