,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your interest in the product but $700,000 is significantly below what it's worth.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating.  $775,000 is still too low, but I'm willing to come down to $825,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product and allows us to reach an agreement.  Let's make this happen!",825000.0,Alice,5,
