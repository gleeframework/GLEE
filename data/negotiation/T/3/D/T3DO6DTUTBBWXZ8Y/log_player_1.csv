{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think it would be a perfect fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $120, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** Using a friendly and positive tone sets the stage for a productive negotiation.
* **Focus on value:**  Mentioning the product's potential fit for Bob highlights its value to him, encouraging him to consider a higher price.

**Next steps:** 

I'll observe Bob's reaction and adapt my strategy accordingly. If he rejects, I'll gauge his interest and either make a counteroffer or move on to John to secure a guaranteed $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $90 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While Bob is interested, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price point. 
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing that I can sell to John for $150 provides me with a safety net and leverage in the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired $150, aiming to find a compromise that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $90 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $110?  This price reflects the quality and value of the product, and I believe it's still a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher than his initial proposal, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on value:**  I reiterate the product's quality and value to reinforce its worth and justify the price. 
* **Positive tone:**  Using a friendly and accommodating tone encourages Bob to continue the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I will assess Bob's response and either accept his offer if it's close to $110, make another counteroffer if necessary, or move on to John if the negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not close enough:** $100 is still $50 below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and I'm still confident in the product's value. 
* **Potential for a slightly higher price:**  Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate. Rejecting his offer keeps the door open for a final counteroffer that might be closer to my desired price.
* **John is a strong safety net:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $150 provides me with leverage and reassures me that I won't lose out if negotiations fall apart.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a final counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $110 or $115. If he rejects, I will move on to John and sell the product for a guaranteed $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget.  I'm willing to make one final adjustment. Would you consider $105? This price is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final compromise:** I'm offering a price that's only $5 away from Bob's offer, demonstrating my commitment to finding a solution. This is my final attempt to secure a deal with Bob.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth and implying that $105 is a good deal, encouraging him to accept.
* **Clear next steps:**  I'm explicitly stating that this is my final offer, putting the ball in Bob's court.

**Next Steps:**

I will observe Bob's response. If he accepts, I'll finalize the sale. If he rejects, I will immediately move on to John and sell the product for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $95 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **No further negotiation is likely:**  Bob's statement that $95 is his highest offer suggests there's little room for further negotiation.
* **John provides a guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John for $150 ensures a profitable sale and eliminates the risk of further negotiations with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will immediately contact John and finalize the sale of the product for $150."
