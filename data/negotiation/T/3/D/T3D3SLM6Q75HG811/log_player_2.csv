"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is close to your maximum budget, but there's still room for negotiation. You can try to get a better price by submitting a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $70?"",
 ""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to anchor the price closer to your desired range. It's a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not comfortable with $70. I can do $82.50, which is a compromise between our previous offers. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is moving closer to your desired price range, but you can still try to negotiate a better deal. It's worth submitting another counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about $75? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
 ""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

This counteroffer attempts to find a middle ground between your last offer and Alice's counteroffer.  You're moving closer to your limit, but you're still aiming for a price that saves you a decent amount compared to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $82. I think that's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $82. Accepting this offer gets you the product at a price significantly lower than John's $100, meeting your goal of saving money."
