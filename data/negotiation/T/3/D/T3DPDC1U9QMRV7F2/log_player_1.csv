Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only afford to pay $800,000.  This is a fair price considering my value for the product and the fact that I have alternative options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects what this product offers. How about we meet halfway at $1,500,000?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,500,000 is still above what I can realistically afford.  Let's split the difference and agree on $1,150,000. This reflects a fair compromise for both of us and would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Even though Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we still have room to negotiate and can likely get closer to $1,300,000 before having to accept John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,150,000 is closer to the mark, I need to see a price that reflects the true value of this product. Would you be willing to consider $1,350,000? I believe this is a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1350000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, and I'm committed to reaching an agreement. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $1,200,000? This is a significant step up from my previous offer, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and at this point, accepting his offer of $1,200,000 is a good deal. It surpasses his initial offer significantly and provides a substantial profit over John's offer."
