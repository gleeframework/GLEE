"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900000 is significantly lower than the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's meet in the middle!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it for $1000000. This is a fair price considering both our needs. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
