"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would you be open to discussing a lower price, perhaps around $150?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $150. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $165. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and quality. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",165.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $160 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more adjustment and offer the product to you for $162. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",162.0,Alice,5,
