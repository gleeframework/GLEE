Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he can potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away or Bob needing to buy from John for a higher price outweighs the potential savings of a few hundred dollars.  At $10,900, Bob is still getting a good deal, and it's likely the best he can do."
