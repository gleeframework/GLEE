,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm trying to stay within a budget, and I'm not sure if $120 is within my means.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $105? That still gives me some room to make a profit, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $100. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
