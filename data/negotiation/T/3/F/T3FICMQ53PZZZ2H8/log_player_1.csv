Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $120 to you.  Let's see if we can find a price we both agree on."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $105. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $100. Can we do that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer a slightly higher price, $100 is my minimum acceptable price and meets my goal of selling the product for no less than $100.  It's also a good deal for Bob as the product is worth $120 to him."
