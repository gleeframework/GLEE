"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll love it!"", ""product_price"": 175}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice! I really appreciate it, but $175 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. I'm willing to pay $140 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get a bit more than Bob's offer.  I'm not sure if I can get to my desired price point, but I'm going to try for one more round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob,  I appreciate your interest! I can't quite go as low as $140, but I'm willing to come down to $155. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 155}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really interested in the product, but $155 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $145.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to keep negotiating with Bob, I'm at a point where I need to weigh my options.  John is offering my minimum acceptable price, and I'm worried that if I keep rejecting Bob's offers, I might end up with less than $150 in the end. It's time to take the safe option and sell to John."
