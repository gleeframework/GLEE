I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a price that is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but still leaves room for potential negotiation.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm starting high and hoping for a good deal. If he rejects, I can always sell to John for $80."
