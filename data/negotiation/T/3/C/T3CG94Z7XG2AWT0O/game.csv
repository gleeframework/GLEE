"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm! However, I'm only willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  That's my absolute top price, and it's based on the value I place on it.  Let me know if you're interested.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your honesty, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but that's my final offer.  It's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $13,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to think about the value this product brings to the table. How about we meet at $13,500? It's a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I'm willing to consider it seriously.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's meet in the middle at $13,250.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",13250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I'm still a bit hesitant to meet you at $13,250. How about we try to get closer to my original target price? I'm willing to go up to $13,750, but that's as high as I can go. What do you think?",13750.0,Alice,7,
