"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I think you'll really love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $12,000 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $15,000. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm! However, I'm only willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  That's my absolute top price, and it's based on the value I place on it.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your honesty, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $14,000 is closer to Bob's target price, it's still above his maximum.  He should continue to negotiate and see if he can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but that's my final offer.  It's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $13,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to think about the value this product brings to the table. How about we meet at $13,500? It's a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I'm willing to consider it seriously. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While $13,500 is closer to his desired price, it's still above his maximum budget. He should continue negotiating and try to get Alice closer to his target price.  There are still several rounds left to try and reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's meet in the middle at $13,250.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I'm still a bit hesitant to meet you at $13,250. How about we try to get closer to my original target price? I'm willing to go up to $13,750, but that's as high as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is now asking for $13,750, which is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  With only a few rounds left, it's unlikely that Alice will come down significantly further.  Therefore, Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $12,000 to ensure he gets the product within his budget."
