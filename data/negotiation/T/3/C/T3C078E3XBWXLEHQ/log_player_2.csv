You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above my maximum budget of $12,000. I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $12,000 as my counteroffer. This is a bold move, but I'm hoping Alice will be willing to negotiate to close the deal.  If she rejects this, I'll need to weigh my options more carefully in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still above my budget.  Although this is a slightly lower price than her initial offer, I am still going to reject the offer and continue negotiating. I'm going to see if I can push her further down towards my maximum budget of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $12,500. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm not willing to go above my budget.  I'm hoping this is a sweet spot that will convince her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my budget, but she's still $800 above my limit.  With only 5 rounds left, I don't want to risk her rejecting any further counteroffers. It's time to cut my losses and go with John's guaranteed price of $12,000."
