Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""its value,"" Alice subtly implies the product is worth the higher price. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** While Alice mentions John, she doesn't explicitly say she'll sell it to him for $12,000. This maintains some leverage.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If Alice knows Bob is very price-sensitive, she might slightly lower her initial offer.
* **Negotiation Skills:**  Alice should be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters her offer. This might involve a slight price reduction or highlighting the product's unique benefits."
