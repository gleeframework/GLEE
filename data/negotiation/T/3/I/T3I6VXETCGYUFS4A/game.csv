"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,500. I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really serious about buying this product, and I'm willing to pay $12,500.  It's a fair price that's within our budgets and allows us to make a deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $12,500 just yet. I'm willing to come down to $14,000, which is still a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",14000.0,Alice,5,
