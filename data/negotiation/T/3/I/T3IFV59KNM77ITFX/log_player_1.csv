{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This offer starts with a friendly message and sets a price point above your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested. It's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is below my minimum value, but I'm not ready to sell to John yet. I'll see if I can get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about we split the difference at $85?  I'm confident you'll still get a great deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $85 is closer, but I'm trying to stick to a tight budget.  Could you do $75?  That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value. While I'd prefer to get more, I don't want to risk a lengthy negotiation and ultimately get less. John's offer is guaranteed and meets my minimum, so I'll take it."
