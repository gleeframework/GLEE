"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price of $175. This is a fair starting point, considering the product is worth $150 to Bob. I'm hoping to get a good deal, but I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $150 if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I'll counter with a slightly lower price and see if we can come to a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 165}
```

I'm lowering my price to $165. This is a significant compromise, but I'm still hoping to get a better price than my minimum. I believe this is a fair offer, considering Bob's willingness to pay $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $155 is a good deal. It's higher than my minimum and closer to my desired price than my last counteroffer.  I'm willing to accept it and move on."
