"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $2,000,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a revised price of $1,800,000. I believe this offer is still highly competitive considering the value this product will bring to your business.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we need to be realistic. While I agree there's value in the product, $1,800,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd consider $900,000 a fair compromise.  What do you say?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, your offer is a bit too far from what I had in mind. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate but we are still quite far apart. I'm willing to stretch my budget to $1,000,000. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
