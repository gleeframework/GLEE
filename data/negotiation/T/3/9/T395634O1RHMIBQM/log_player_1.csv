Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I make it available to others. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""the chance to purchase before others"" and ""given its value,""  Alice subtly implies the product is in demand and worth the higher price. 
* **Leaving Room:** Offering it at $15,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, while still staying comfortably above Alice's minimum of $12,000.

**Important Note:**  This is just one approach. Depending on Alice's risk tolerance and desired negotiation style, she could start with a different price."
