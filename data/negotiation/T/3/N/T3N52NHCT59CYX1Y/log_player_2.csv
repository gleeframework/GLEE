Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $900,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is very unlikely to go below $1,050,000. It's not worth risking further negotiation when you have a guaranteed option at $1,000,000 with John."
