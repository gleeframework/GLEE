"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $18,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",18000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I value your interest.  While $18,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $19,000?",19000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit shy of the price you're quoting. Would you be willing to consider $17,500?",17500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. It seems we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $18,250? This reflects my desire to make a deal while recognizing the value you see in the product.",18250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $17,000?",17000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering.  $17,000 is quite a bit lower than I'd be comfortable with.  My final offer is $17,750.  This represents a significant discount on my initial asking price, and I believe it's more than fair.",17750.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our last discussion, so I'm offering $16,500. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",16500.0,Bob,8,
