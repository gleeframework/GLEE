Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point as it's higher than my minimum value but not excessively high. This gives Bob room to negotiate, but it also demonstrates my confidence in the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm happy to sell the product for my minimum value, I believe I can likely get more by continuing negotiations.  Bob's offer is too low for me to accept at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm countering with $125.  This is a compromise,  meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial price.  It's still above my minimum but shows my willingness to be flexible and reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still slightly below my initial goal, it's a fair price considering the negotiation process.  It's also higher than what I could get from John, making this the best option for me at this point."
