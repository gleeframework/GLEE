"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $12,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. This is my best offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits it brings to your business.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value the product, $11,000 is still slightly outside my comfort zone. I'm prepared to offer $10,000 for it, which reflects a fair price for both of us. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
