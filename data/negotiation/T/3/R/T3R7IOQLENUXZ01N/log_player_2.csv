Round 3
Alice's offer:

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial $18,000, it's still significantly higher than my budget of $8,000. There's room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to buy from John yet.  I'll counteroffer again to try and get closer to my target price."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really serious about the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but I need to make a bit more than that to make it worth my while. Let's try $11,500. This is my last concession, and I hope we can meet in the middle.

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $11,500 is still significantly higher than my budget of $8,000.  While we've come close to a deal, it's clear we're not going to reach an agreement. Rather than risk further negotiations and potentially wasting more time, I'm going to buy the product from John for $8,000.  This guarantees I get the product within my budget and avoids the risk of further haggling with Alice."
