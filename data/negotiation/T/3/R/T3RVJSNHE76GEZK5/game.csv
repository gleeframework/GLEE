"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. That's the highest price I'm willing to pay.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference and go with $950,000?  It's still a great price for you, and it gives me a bit more room to make this work.",950000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here.  $920,000 just isn't enough for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $935,000?  It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm not sure I can go any lower.",935000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $915,000? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",915000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting a bit frustrated with this back and forth.  $915,000 is just too low for me.  How about we settle on $925,000. This is my final offer, and if it's not acceptable, I'm going to have to go with another buyer.",925000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand you're getting frustrated, but I'm still willing to work with you. How about we meet at $910,000? That's as low as I'm willing to go.",910000.0,Bob,8,
