"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a significant portion of the value Bob sees in the product.  This gives us room to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway on his last offer.  This is a significant step down from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price and leaves room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better deal.  I'm going to counteroffer again and try to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm going to make a final counteroffer to Bob.  This price is a compromise between our last offers, and I'm hoping it will be enough to secure a deal.  If he rejects this offer, I'm ready to accept John's offer to ensure I don't lose out on a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my initial goal, Bob's offer is above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  We're running out of time, and accepting this offer ensures I make a profit."
