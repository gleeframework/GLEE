"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not sure I'm willing to pay $950000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $800000. Can we meet in the middle at $875000?",875000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $875000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your offer. I'm thinking of a price of $912500. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value and rarity.",912500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet us halfway, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to go up to $900000, but I think that's the maximum I'm comfortable with. Can we meet at $900000?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you a price of $920000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value and rarity.",920000.0,Alice,5,
