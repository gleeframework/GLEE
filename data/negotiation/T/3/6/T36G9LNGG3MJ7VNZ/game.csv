"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested in the product, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to offer $10,500 for it.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $10,800. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I think it's a great compromise.",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks again for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate you coming down in price, $10,800 is still slightly higher than what I can comfortably pay right now.  I'm willing to offer $10,200 for the product.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value I'm placing on the product.",10200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,200. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I can offer the product to you for $10,600. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",10600.0,Alice,5,
