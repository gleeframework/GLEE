"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're aiming to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's offer of $11,000 is above your maximum budget of $10,000.
* It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further to see if you can get a lower price.  You can always buy from John as a fallback option."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested in the product, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $10,800. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I think it's a great compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800.

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $10,800 is still above your maximum budget of $10,000.
* You can still try to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your desired price. You can always buy from John as a fallback option if you don't reach an agreement."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,200. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I can offer the product to you for $10,600. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,600

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's final offer of $10,600 is still above your maximum budget of $10,000.
* You have a reliable alternative in John who's willing to sell the product for exactly your budget.
* It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice at this point, as the risk of a further price reduction is low, and you could potentially end up paying more than John's price."
