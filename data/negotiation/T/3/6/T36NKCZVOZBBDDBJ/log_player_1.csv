"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly lower than my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point that hopefully will encourage Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $80. Would you consider reducing the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $150.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell at such a low price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $80 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm dropping the price slightly from my initial offer to show flexibility but still staying above my minimum value. I'm also reiterating the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate the offer, but I'm still hoping to keep it under $80. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, his offer of $90 is still too low. I'm going to counteroffer again, but I'm starting to feel the pressure. If Bob doesn't come up, I might have to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but $90 is still below my minimum. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $100 for the product.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
I'm trying to find a compromise with Bob by splitting the difference between our previous offers. I'm hoping that this will be enough to convince him to buy the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see, Alice. Thank you for your flexibility. I really appreciate it. I would like to propose $95 as my final offer. I hope this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price point. I'm going to counteroffer again. I'm running out of rounds, so I need to make a decision soon about whether to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $95 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $98 as my final offer. This is a great deal for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. If you're not interested, I'm going to have to start considering other options."", ""product_price"": 98}
```

I'm making a slight concession to Bob to show good faith, but I'm also trying to make it clear that I'm running out of time and patience. I'm hoping this final offer will convince him to close the deal."
