Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $15,000 to him, I'll try to get as close to that value as possible while still making a profit. I'll offer it to him for $12,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer of $11,000 is lower than my initial offer of $12,000, but it's still a decent price. I'll think carefully about it...

Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, I'm willing to compromise a bit more. I'll reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer to try to get closer to the true value.

I'll offer Bob the product for $12,500.
