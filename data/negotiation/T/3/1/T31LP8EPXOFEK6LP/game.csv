"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. I'm interested, but I'm going to need to come in a bit lower.  How about $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not sure I can go as low as $1,000,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still not quite there yet. How about $1,025,000? It's a fair price for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I think $1,025,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $1,025,000, which would be $1,037,500. What do you think?",1037500.0,Alice,5,
