"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I've already made significant concessions and I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer. I'm afraid I'll have to reject your offer of $890000. I'm still open to negotiations, but I need a price that's closer to my minimum of $950000. Let's try to find a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to meet you at $918000. This is my last offer.",918000.0,Alice,7,,

"Hi Bob, I'm disappointed that we couldn't meet an agreement. I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer, and I'm starting to think that selling the product to you might not be the best option for me.

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to get frustrated that we're not meeting in the middle. I've already made several concessions and I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer.
