"Hi Alice,  $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $10,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $13,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,250. It's a fair price, and I'm sure we can both be happy with it. What do you think?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, but $11,250 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $12,800. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",12800.0,Alice,5,
