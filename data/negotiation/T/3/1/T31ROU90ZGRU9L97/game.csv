"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my original offer. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This price still gives you a great value, and it's more fair for me. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so how about we try $11,750? I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",11750.0,Bob,4,
