"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe is worth a lot to the right person.  I'm starting with an offer of $15000, but I'm open to negotiating a fair price. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the value I'm placing on this product, I'm willing to pay $12000.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $12000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to come down to $13500 to meet you halfway. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's still significantly more than John is offering. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really only able to spend $12000.  This is my final offer, as I'm prepared to purchase from John at that price if we can't reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
