"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe is worth a lot to the right person.  I'm starting with an offer of $15000, but I'm open to negotiating a fair price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $15,000 is more than his maximum budget, and he can get the product for less from John.  By rejecting, he opens the negotiation and can try to get a lower price from Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to come down to $13500 to meet you halfway. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's still significantly more than John is offering. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still more than Bob's budget.  He can get the product from John for $12,000, making Alice's offer less attractive. He should continue negotiating to try and get a lower price."
