"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While $130 is less than your maximum budget, there's a good chance you can get a better price. Alice is clearly motivated to sell and her initial offer leaves room for negotiation."
