Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation ($150) maximizes your potential profit. A price of $130 gives Bob a good deal while still earning you significantly more than your minimum. 

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob tries to negotiate for a lower price.  You'll need to decide if you're willing to go lower or risk losing the sale to John."
