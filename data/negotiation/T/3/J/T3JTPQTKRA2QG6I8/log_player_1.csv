Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $120 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $119 maximizes your potential profit while still making the deal attractive to Bob. He gets a small discount, and you get almost the maximum possible price. 

This strategy aims to secure the best possible outcome for you while still making the offer appealing to Bob."
