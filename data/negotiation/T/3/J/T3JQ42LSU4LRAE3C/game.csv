"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. While I see the value in this product, $1200000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $950000 for it. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950000 is significantly below what this product is truly worth.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial price point. I'm offering $1050000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for some room for negotiation.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1050000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'm offering $1000000.  This shows my commitment to buying this product and allows us to reach a fair agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
