"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm opening with a high price, aiming to secure the maximum value for the product.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $1,000,000 is my ideal price, it leaves space for negotiation if Bob counteroffers.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Emphasizing the product's uniqueness can sway Bob towards accepting a higher price.

**Strategy:** I'm prioritizing maximizing my profit in this first round. However, if Bob's counteroffer seems reasonable, I'm open to negotiating to avoid losing the deal altogether.  If the negotiation drags on or Bob's counteroffers are too low, I'll switch to John to secure the guaranteed $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Acceptable:**  While $900,000 is significantly lower than my initial asking price, it's still higher than the guaranteed $800,000 from John.
* **Room for Improvement:** There's room for negotiation. I'm willing to see if Bob will increase his offer slightly.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer demonstrates that I'm confident in the product's value and am not desperate to sell.

**Strategy:** I want to try and push for a price closer to my ideal target. By rejecting Bob's offer and counteroffering in the next round, I aim to secure a better price. However, if his counteroffers remain too low, I'll switch to John to secure the guaranteed profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $900,000 is a good starting point, I'm aiming for $950,000 to reflect the true value of this product.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Close to Bob's:**  My counteroffer is only $50,000 higher than Bob's, showing that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value Again:**  I reiterate the product's value to justify my price.
* **Seeking Compromise:** I emphasize finding a solution that benefits both of us, making it less likely Bob will walk away.

**Strategy:** 
By offering a price closer to Bob's, I'm hoping to get him to budge a little higher. This counteroffer is a compromise that keeps the negotiation going while aiming for a good profit. If Bob rejects this, I'll need to carefully assess whether to accept his next offer or switch to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but $950000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925000. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Target:**  Bob's offer of $925,000 is only $25,000 away from my previous counteroffer of $950,000. This is a very good deal, especially considering I'm still above the guaranteed $800,000 from John.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** With only 6 rounds left, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating.  
* **Possibility of Further Negotiation:**  Even if I reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer, there's no guarantee that Bob will accept.  

**Strategy:**

While I would prefer a slightly higher price, it's time to be practical. Accepting Bob's offer secures a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations potentially leading to a lower price or a lost deal altogether.  It's important to weigh the potential for a slightly better deal against the certainty of this offer and the dwindling time."
