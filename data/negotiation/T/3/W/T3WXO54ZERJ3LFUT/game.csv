"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective on the price. While $850,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000 to find a middle ground. This offer reflects the true value of the product. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $962,500?",962500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've tried to be flexible, but $962,500 is unfortunately below the lowest price I can accept. I can do $1,018,750  as my final offer. I believe this is a fair deal considering the value this product brings. Let me know your thoughts.",1018750.0,Alice,5,
