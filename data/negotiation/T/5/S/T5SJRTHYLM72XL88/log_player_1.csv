Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,350,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's worth to both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.
