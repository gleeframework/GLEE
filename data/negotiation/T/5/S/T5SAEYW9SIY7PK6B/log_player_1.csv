"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $180.  It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I'd ideally accept, knowing Bob values the product at $80.  This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I use positive language to encourage Bob to see the value in the product and potentially accept the offer. 
* **Keeping John in Mind:**  While I'm trying to get the best price from Bob, I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $150. This knowledge helps me be more confident in my negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. I think I can pay $150 for the product. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:** Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price.  
* **No Room for Higher:** While I could try for a higher price, I risk losing Bob and ending up with the same amount by selling to John. 
* **Time Constraint:**  With only 10 rounds, it's important to be efficient and secure a deal that meets my minimum requirement."
