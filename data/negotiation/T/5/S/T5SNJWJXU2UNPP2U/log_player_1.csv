Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $13,500.  I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this."",
""product_price"": 13500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Alice knows her product's worth to her ($12,000) and Bob's potential valuation ($10,000).  Starting with a price of $13,500 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value without revealing Alice's minimum price. This encourages Bob to engage in a discussion.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  By stating ""I'm open to hearing your thoughts,"" Alice shows flexibility and invites Bob to counter-offer, making a deal more likely.

**Important Note:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000. This strong fallback position allows her to negotiate from a point of strength."
