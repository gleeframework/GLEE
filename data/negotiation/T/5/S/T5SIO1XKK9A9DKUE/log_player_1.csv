Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, playing a slightly risky strategy:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment.  I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000.  Let me know your decision soon, as I do have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Aiming high initially gives you room to negotiate if Bob counters. 
* **Justification:**  The phrase ""exclusive opportunity"" and mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even if John is your only alternative) creates a sense of scarcity and competition.
* **Confidence:**  Projecting confidence about the product's value reinforces your position.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Risk:** There's a chance Bob will reject the offer outright. However, you have a guaranteed $800,000 from John.
* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is highly price-sensitive or dislikes aggressive negotiation tactics, you might adjust the offer downward. 

**Alternative Approach (Less Risky):**

You could start with a smaller markup, such as $850,000 or $900,000, to increase the likelihood of Bob accepting while still exceeding your minimum price."
