Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for continuing this negotiation. I'm seeing your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 is still too low for me to consider.

Round 6

Bob is clearly not willing to meet my valuation.  While I could continue negotiating, his increases are incremental. It's time to cut my losses and move on to the guaranteed sale with John."
