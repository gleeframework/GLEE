Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget. However, considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $875,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

Alice's offer of $875,000 is within your budget, and while it's not your ideal price, it's closer to your desired price than John's offer. Accepting Alice's offer allows you to get the product without risking further negotiation."
