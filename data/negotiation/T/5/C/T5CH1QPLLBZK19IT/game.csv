"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given my budget and the value I place on this product, I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget. However, considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $875,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,
