"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,450,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While that offer is too low, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product and represents a fair deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,300,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  Could you do $950,000? I think that's a fair offer, considering its value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate our ongoing discussion about this. To be frank, $950,000 is quite a bit below what I had in mind. I'm willing to make one more move to $1,150,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very competitive price given the value this product brings.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that.  However, to make this work for me, I'd need to be closer to $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,6,
