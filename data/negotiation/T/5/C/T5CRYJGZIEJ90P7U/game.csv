"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is way too high. I'm only willing to pay $10,000 for this product, as that's what it's worth to me.  Let me know if you're interested in that price.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you think my initial offer was a bit high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and my minimum price of $15,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $14,000 is still too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $12,000 for the product. That's a fair compromise considering our positions, and it's still significantly less than what I'd pay John.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000, but I'm willing to meet you at $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and my minimum price of $15,000. I'm not getting any younger, and I'd rather not wait for a better offer from John, so I'm willing to make a serious compromise here.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're willing to compromise, but $13,500 is still too much for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value we both place on the product, and it's a significant compromise on my end. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",12500.0,Bob,6,
