"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $80 is quite low. How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,

I appreciate you working with me Alice.  $130 is still a little too high for my budget.  Could you do $90?,90.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $90.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $110? This is my final offer.",110.0,Alice,5,
