Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **One-Shot Deal:** Bob gets one chance to accept. This gives you some leverage.

**Offer Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a deal. Offering the product for its full value to Bob ($1,200,000) is unlikely to work, as he has no incentive to accept.  

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product.  Given its potential value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Why This Might Work**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting at $1,150,000 sets a strong anchor point for the negotiation.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message focuses on the product's value to Bob, not just the price.
* **Urgency (Slight):**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a subtle sense of urgency without being overly aggressive.
* **Profit for You:** This price ensures you make a significant profit over your guaranteed offer from John.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might try to negotiate a lower price. You'll need to decide if you're willing to go lower or if you'd rather sell to John for your guaranteed $1,000,000."
