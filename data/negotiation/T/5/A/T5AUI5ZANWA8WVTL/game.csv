"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm keen on the product, but  $1,200,000 is a little steep for me.  Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm still interested in selling the product to you. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, I'm still finding it a bit high. How about we settle at $925,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still looking for a compromise, Bob. However, I've already met you halfway and offered the product for $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to prioritize my own interests. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
