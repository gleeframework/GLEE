"Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for no more than $120.  Alice's offer of $170 is far too high.  Bob should reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is willing to pay a maximum of $120 for the product.  He should start by offering Alice his maximum price, as this establishes his position and sets the stage for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $160 is still too high for Bob, as he is willing to pay a maximum of $120. He should reject the offer and continue negotiating to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is willing to pay up to $120.  However, he's rejected Alice's offer of $160, indicating he's willing to pay *something* more than his ideal price. Offering $130 is a compromise, showing he's serious about buying the product but still holding firm to his goal of paying less than Alice's initial asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $140 is still more than Bob's ideal price of $120, but it's getting closer.  At this point, Bob has a couple of considerations:

* **Risk of further negotiation:** If Bob rejects and makes another counteroffer, there's a risk Alice will get stubborn and refuse to lower the price further.  
* **Opportunity cost:** While Bob could potentially get the product for $120 from John, there's no guarantee that John will still be willing to sell at that price if Bob delays. 

Considering these factors, it's likely in Bob's best interest to accept Alice's offer of $140.  While not ideal, it's a reasonable compromise and a good chance to secure the product without risking further negotiation or losing out to John."
