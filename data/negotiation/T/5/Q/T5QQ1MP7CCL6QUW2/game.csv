"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $100. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $100 is closer, I'm still a bit over my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85.  It's the most I can afford at the moment.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $85 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $92. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if you're interested.",92.0,Alice,5,
