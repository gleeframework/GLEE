Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $1,800,000 is still below my minimum, and I have several rounds left to negotiate."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, the negotiations with Bob haven't yielded a price I'm comfortable with. I'm worried that if I continue to reject his offers, he might walk away entirely.  It's best to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John rather than risk getting nothing."
