"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $130. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",130.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $120? That's a fair deal for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a fair deal, Bob! However, I've already gone down to $130 and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $125. It's the lowest I can go and still make a profit.",125.0,Alice,5,
