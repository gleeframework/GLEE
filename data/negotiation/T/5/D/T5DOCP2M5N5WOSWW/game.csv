"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1,800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1,600,000 for it. What do you think?",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,700,000. Let's try $1,650,000.  It's a fair price, considering the value of the product, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1650000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're still a bit hesitant, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,650,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I'll counteroffer at $1,680,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1680000.0,Alice,5,
