# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $20,000 is more than Bob is willing to pay.  It's worth trying to negotiate a better price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $18000. Is that something you'd be comfortable with? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $18,000 is closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower, especially since he has the option of buying from John for $15,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $17500. It's a fair price, considering the value this product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  While $17,500 is a good price, it's still higher than what John is offering. Since John is willing to sell the product for $15,000, which is within Bob's budget, there's no need to continue negotiating with Alice."
