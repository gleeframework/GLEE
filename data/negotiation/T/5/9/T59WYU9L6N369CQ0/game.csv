"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While I understand your perspective on the value, the price you're proposing doesn't quite reflect the true worth of this product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can find an agreement that works for both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
