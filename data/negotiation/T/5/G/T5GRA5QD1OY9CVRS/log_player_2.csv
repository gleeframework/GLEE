Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $700,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. However, I need to make a profit on this deal, so I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700,000 and $900,000. I'm offering you the product for $825,000. This is my final counteroffer for now.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750,000 is still a bit above your target, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is the best possible outcome. Alice has reached her lowest acceptable price, and it's within your budget. There's no guarantee you can negotiate further down, and you risk losing the deal entirely."
