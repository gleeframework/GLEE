Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

This offer is a good balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring a sale. 

Here's the logic:

* **My minimum:** I'm willing to sell for $800,000 as that's John's offer.
* **Bob's maximum:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation:** Offering $950,000 gives Bob a $50,000 saving, which is a significant incentive. This also allows me to earn $150,000 more than John's offer.

By offering a price closer to Bob's perceived value, I increase the likelihood of a sale while still securing a profitable deal for myself."
