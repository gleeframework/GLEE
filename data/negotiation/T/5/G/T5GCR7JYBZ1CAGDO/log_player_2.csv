"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can still do better.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you force her to lower her price or risk losing the sale to John. There's a good chance Alice will counter-offer with a price closer to her $800,000 valuation to secure the sale."
