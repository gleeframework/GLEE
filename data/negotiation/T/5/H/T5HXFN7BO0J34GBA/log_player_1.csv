Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product has tremendous potential for your company, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny. I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is a significant amount, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Focus on Value:** My message highlights the product's value to Bob, making him more likely to consider a higher price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message ends with a clear invitation to discuss, showing that I'm open to reaching an agreement.

This approach aims to maximize my profit while keeping the negotiation open and potentially leading to a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your confidence in its potential. However, based on our current budget constraints, we would like to propose a lower price of $1300000. We hope this aligns better with our financial planning. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below the value I'm aiming for. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** I believe there's room to increase the price further.  
* **Not risking a loss:** Selling to John would result in a lower profit than what I can potentially get from Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is closer to our target, it's still a bit below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by moving closer to Bob's price, but not sacrificing too much of my desired profit. 
* **Emphasize value:** I reiterate the product's value to emphasize the fairness of my counteroffer.
* **Openness to agreement:** I highlight the possibility of a mutually beneficial deal, encouraging Bob to accept my offer. 

This approach aims to find a middle ground that both parties can accept, while maintaining a profitable price for myself."
