"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I'm confident this price reflects the product's worth, and I'm open to discussing it further."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. This strategy is common in high-value deals.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's unique qualities and emphasizing its worth to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Openness to Discussion:**  I'm letting Bob know I'm open to negotiating, which can make him feel more comfortable and potentially open to a higher price. 
* **Room for Counteroffer:** My offer leaves room for Bob to make a counteroffer within a reasonable range.

**Next Steps:** 

* If Bob rejects my offer, I will carefully consider his counteroffer and weigh it against my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and the value of potentially selling to John for that price.
*  I'll continue to adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses and the number of rounds remaining."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) but still falls short.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe I can still negotiate a better price. There are still eight rounds remaining, and I can leverage John's offer of $1,000,000 as a negotiating tool.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my leverage and show him that I'm not desperate to close the deal quickly.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will counteroffer with a price between $900,000 and $1,000,000, trying to find a compromise that is acceptable to both of us.
* **Monitoring John's Offer:**  I'll continue to keep John's offer in mind as a backup option, but I'll prioritize getting the best possible price from Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000 to reflect the true value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle at $950,000. This price allows for a fair deal for both of us and avoids further negotiation."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within Range:** I'm offering a price that's higher than Bob's last offer but still lower than my initial offer, signaling my willingness to compromise while maintaining a strong position.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to justify my price. 
* **Proposal for Compromise:** I'm framing my offer as a ""middle ground"" to encourage Bob to accept, suggesting that further negotiation might be unproductive. 
* **Time Pressure:** I'm subtly emphasizing the need for a decision as the number of rounds remaining decreases.

**Next Steps:**

* **Assess Bob's Response:**  I'll closely watch Bob's response to gauge his willingness to negotiate further.
* **Adjust Strategy:** If Bob rejects my offer again, I'll consider lowering my price slightly in the next round. However, I will still aim for a price closer to $1,000,000.
* **Monitor John's Offer:**  I'll continue to keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option in case the negotiations with Bob reach an impasse."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. I'm willing to consider $925,000, but I think that's the maximum I can go. I'm really interested in this product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.

* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** With 6 rounds remaining, I still have time to negotiate but need to maintain a balance between getting a good price and avoiding a stalemate. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, aiming for something between $935,000 and $945,000. 
* **Communicating Flexibility:**  I'll emphasize my willingness to compromise and make it clear that I'm not far from agreeing to a deal.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** I'll continue to subtly suggest that I have a backup offer from John, while acknowledging Bob's budget constraints."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm happy to bridge the gap and propose $940,000.

* **Time Pressure:**  Subtly mentioning that there are only five rounds left increases the pressure on Bob to make a decision.

**Next Steps:**

* **Monitor Bob's Response:** I will carefully analyze Bob's response to gauge his willingness to accept or counteroffer.
* **Adjust Strategy:** Depending on Bob's reaction, I may slightly adjust my counteroffer in the next round, but I'll aim to keep the price above $935,000.
* **Keep John's Offer in Mind:**  I'll continue to use John's offer as a negotiating tool if needed, but I prefer to finalize a deal with Bob if possible."

* **Leveraging John's Offer:** I am still holding John's offer as a safety net, which allows me to stand firm on my price and not settle for a significantly lower amount.
