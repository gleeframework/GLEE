"I appreciate your offer, but I think it's a bit high. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $1050000 for the product. Let's find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you have a limit, but $990000 is still too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and go down to $1007500.  This is a reasonable price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident we can close this deal.",1007500.0,Alice,7,
