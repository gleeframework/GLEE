Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing within a very profitable range for you.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have John as a backup at $1,200,000 provides a safety net. You won't be pressured into accepting an offer below your minimum. 

**The Message:**

The message strikes a balance between confidence and flexibility. It highlights the product's value to Bob specifically, justifying the high price while still leaving room for discussion."
