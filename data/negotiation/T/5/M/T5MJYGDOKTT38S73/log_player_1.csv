{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value. This allows room for negotiation while still giving me a good profit.  I'm also framing the offer positively, highlighting the value of the product to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider $95 as the price for your product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $80, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $100. I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget.  I'm willing to come down a little bit to $105.  This still gives me a fair profit, and it's closer to your offer.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose $100 as the price for your product. This still allows for a reasonable profit for you while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum acceptable value. It's a fair price for both of us. Accepting this offer ensures I get my desired profit without risking losing the sale to John or engaging in further negotiation."
