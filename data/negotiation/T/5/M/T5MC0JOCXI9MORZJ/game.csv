"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget and the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1100000. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for in terms of a mutually beneficial transaction.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our potential partnership, $1100000 doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to come down to $1150000.  This still allows for a fair return on my investment while giving you a valuable product within your budget. Let's find a common ground for a successful deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and the investment you've made. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1150000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1125000. I hope this proposal allows us to reach an agreement that is acceptable to both parties.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
