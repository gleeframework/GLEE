"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product at a good price. However, my budget is limited to $8000 for this purchase. Would it be possible for us to negotiate closer to that amount?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your interest, $8000 is quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and try $10000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this product will bring you great value.",10000.0,Alice,3,
