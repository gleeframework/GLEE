This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's higher than your minimum but leaves room for negotiation. It acknowledges that Bob values the product more, but also shows you're willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 
While $13,200 is lower than my initial target, it's still a good deal for me.  It's higher than John's offer, and it's closer to my minimum price point. Continuing to negotiate could result in a lower price or a lengthy negotiation process that might ultimately lead to a lower price or a rejection from Bob.  Accepting the offer ensures a sale at a decent price without the risk of getting less."
