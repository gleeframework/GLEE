Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is way more than his maximum budget of $8,000. He should try to negotiate with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. Would you be interested in that?

You have three options:

While $12,000 is better than Alice's original offer, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. He should continue negotiating with Alice."

Bob has reached his limit. While $11,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than Bob's budget of $8,000.  He has already made multiple counteroffers and Alice hasn't shown a willingness to budge much further.  At this point, it's in Bob's best interest to buy from John for the guaranteed price of $8,000."
