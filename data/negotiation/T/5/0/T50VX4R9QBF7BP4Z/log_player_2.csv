"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000.  I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He wants to save as much money as possible, and $20,000 is more than his limit. He can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $14,000 at this time.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your position, but $14,000 is quite a bit below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his limit, he can still try to get a better price. He should counteroffer again, aiming to get closer to his target of $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $17,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $15,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 15500}
