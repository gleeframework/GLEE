"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and $15,000 is above his budget.
* There are still 9 rounds left, giving Bob room to negotiate. 
* Buying from John for $10,000 is always an option, but it's best to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is trying to get the lowest price possible, so starting with a significant counteroffer is a good strategy.
* $9,000 is still within Bob's budget, and leaves room for further negotiation.
*  A lower price will encourage Alice to consider a deal and potentially counter with a price closer to Bob's target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $12,000 is still above Bob's budget, but it's closer than her initial price.
* Bob still has 7 rounds left, giving him time to continue negotiating for a lower price.
*  He shouldn't buy from John yet because there is still potential for a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has shown willingness to negotiate by lowering her price, suggesting she might be open to a deal within Bob's budget.
* This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise, being halfway between Bob's last offer and Alice's current offer.
* It gives Alice a chance to meet Bob's budget without feeling pressured to accept a price significantly below her own."
