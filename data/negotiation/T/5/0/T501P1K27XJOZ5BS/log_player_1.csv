Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John offers a safety net at $800,000, Bob values the product much higher at $1,500,000. Our goal is to get as close to that $1,500,000 as possible.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,300,000 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can still likely settle on a price significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Justification:** The message subtly highlights the product's ""potential value"" and ""return on investment"" to remind Bob of its worth to him, justifying the high price."
