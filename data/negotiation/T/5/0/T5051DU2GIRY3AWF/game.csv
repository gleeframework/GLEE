"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $140 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend right now. Would you be willing to come down to $135? It's a fair price for both of us.",135.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $135. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $137.50. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",137.5,Alice,3,
