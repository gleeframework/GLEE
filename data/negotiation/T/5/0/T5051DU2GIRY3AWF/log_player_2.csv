You are willing to pay up to $150, and Alice's offer is $140. It's worth trying to get a better deal. You can counteroffer and see if you can get it for closer to your $150 limit."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $140 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend right now. Would you be willing to come down to $135? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $135. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $137.50. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has come down from her initial $140 offer to $137.50, which is within your budget.  While you could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice won't go lower and you risk losing the product entirely.  Accepting her offer is the best option to ensure you get the product at a price that's still within your limit."
