"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is my opening offer to Bob. I'm aiming high, knowing the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me. I want to gauge his initial interest and see if he's willing to play ball at a potentially high price.  If he rejects, I'll adjust accordingly in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I need to be mindful of the number of rounds, I'm not desperate to sell right now.  I believe I can get a better price, especially since I know the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to lower my price a bit from the initial offer, but I'm still aiming for a substantial profit.  $1,200,000 is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth.  If Bob is serious about buying, this should be an acceptable figure."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is tempting, I'm still not convinced that's the best I can get.  I've already lowered my price significantly, but I believe I can still squeeze out a little more. I'll counteroffer again in the next round, but I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway.  I've lowered my price again, but it's still a profitable deal for me.  This should be a reasonable offer for Bob as well, and I'm hopeful we can finally close the deal in this round. If not, I'll seriously consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $950,000 is getting closer to my target, I'm still not convinced that it's the best I can do. I've got four rounds left, and I want to see if I can push for a slightly higher price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to make one final push for a higher price.  $1,050,000 is a good compromise, and I'm confident that Bob will see the value in accepting this offer. We're getting close to the end of the negotiation, and I'm still holding out hope that we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. If he rejects this offer, I'll likely accept John's offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're down to the wire, and Bob is still refusing to meet me halfway.  I've already lowered my price considerably, and I'm not confident that I can get a better offer from him in the remaining rounds.  I'm going to take John's offer and close the deal. It's a good price, and it guarantees a sale."
