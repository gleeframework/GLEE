"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $8,500? ",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still quite attached to my initial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,750. What do you think?",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8,750 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's aim for $8,600. It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that.",8600.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much money on the table. I'm willing to go down to $8,700. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",8700.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again, and I'll offer $8,650.  I'm confident this is a fair price that we can both agree on.",8650.0,Bob,6,

"I'm getting a bit concerned that we're getting too close to the lowest price I'm willing to accept, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll go down to $8,675. That's the absolute lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",8675.0,Alice,7,
