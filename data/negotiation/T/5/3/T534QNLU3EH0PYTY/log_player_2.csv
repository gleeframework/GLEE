"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $100 to Alice, and she's offering it for $120.  It's worth $150 to you, so you can aim to get a lower price.  Rejecting her offer gives you the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm.  However, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $110 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on 115? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $115 is a good compromise.  You're still getting the product for less than what it's worth to you ($150), and it's likely that further negotiation won't get you a significantly lower price."
