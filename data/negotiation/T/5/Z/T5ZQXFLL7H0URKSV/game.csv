"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $650,000. I believe that's a fair offer considering its value to me.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $650,000 is quite a bit below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. However, $875,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $725,000? I'm eager to work towards a deal.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close. While $725,000 is appealing, I can't quite justify letting it go for less than $800,000. This is my firm bottom line; I believe it reflects the product's genuine worth.",800000.0,Alice,5,
