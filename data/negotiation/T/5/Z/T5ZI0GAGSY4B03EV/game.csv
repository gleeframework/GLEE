,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $100 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $125 is still a bit high for me. How about $110? That's a fair compromise and we can both walk away happy.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $110 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $115. This is my final offer before I move on to other potential buyers.",115.0,Alice,5,
