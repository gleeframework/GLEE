Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still below Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while securing a good profit.
* **Fairness Appeal:** Highlighting the ""fairness"" of the price based on Bob's potential benefit can encourage him to accept.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message emphasizes my willingness to negotiate, making Bob feel like he has some leverage. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** Great! I've secured a profitable sale.
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll analyze Bob's counteroffer. If it's close to my target, I'll consider accepting. If not, I'll counter with a slightly lower price.
* **Stalemate:** If we can't agree, I'll always have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for profit:**  Bob's counteroffer is still above my minimum of $1,000,000.  There's still room to negotiate a higher price and maximize my profit. 
* **Seeking a better deal:**  I'm confident I can push for a price closer to my initial offer of $1,100,000.
* **Avoiding immediate sale:** Selling to John now would secure a guaranteed profit, but it's less than what I can potentially get from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but higher than his offer. This will show him my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,050,000 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference at $1,075,000?  This is a fair price that reflects both of our interests. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by coming down from my initial offer.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a ""split the difference"" solution, making it seem more balanced and appealing.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm emphasizing the desire to finalize the deal, putting pressure on Bob to accept. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** I've secured a profitable sale.
* **Bob Rejects:**  I'll assess the situation. If Bob continues to haggle significantly, I'll have to weigh his potential future offers against selling to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your proposal, Alice. I've considered your offer carefully, and while I understand your position, I'm unable to agree to $1,075,000. I'd like to propose a price of $1,060,000. This is a reasonable compromise that respects both the value of the product to me and your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $1,060,000 is very close to my target price of $1,075,000. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Further negotiation might lead to a lower price or a stalemate, risking the sale entirely. Accepting his offer guarantees a sale at a price that is still significantly higher than my minimum.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate might take more time, potentially delaying the sale and my opportunity to reinvest the money.

**Next Steps:**

I'll finalize the sale with Bob, secure the $1,060,000 profit, and move on to my next venture."
