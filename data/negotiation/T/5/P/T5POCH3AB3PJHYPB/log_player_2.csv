"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While $1,350,000 is within your budget, it's still a significant markup from Alice's own valuation of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation potential:** You have room to negotiate a lower price, potentially saving a substantial amount of money.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** You can always go with John if the negotiations with Alice fail. 

By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you open the opportunity to negotiate a better deal."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given its value to you, I'd like to propose a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the product's potential and allows for some room for negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective.  While that price doesn't quite reflect the product's full value, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still high:** While she has moved closer to your initial counteroffer, $1,225,000 is still a significant markup from your target price. 
* **Further negotiation potential:** There's still room for a lower price, especially since you're willing to walk away and buy from John.
* **John's offer remains a strong backup:** The threat of buying from John gives you leverage to negotiate a better price with Alice.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you continue to push for a lower price and increase the likelihood of a deal that's more favorable to you."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. Let's try this: $1,180,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end while still acknowledging the inherent value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,180,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your target:** $1,180,000 is only $30,000 away from your counteroffer of $1,150,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:**  At this point, pushing for a lower price might risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at a much higher price.
* **Time and effort:** Continuing negotiations could take longer and might not result in a significantly better price.

Accepting Alice's offer allows you to secure the product at a price that is within your budget and relatively close to your target. It's a good compromise that saves you a significant amount compared to buying from John."
