"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given its value to you, I'd like to propose a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the product's potential and allows for some room for negotiation.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While that price doesn't quite reflect the product's full value, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,225,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a bit hesitant.  To make this work for me, I need to be closer to $1,150,000.  This price acknowledges the value of the product while also being within my budget.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. Let's try this: $1,180,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end while still acknowledging the inherent value of the product. What do you think?",1180000.0,Alice,5,
