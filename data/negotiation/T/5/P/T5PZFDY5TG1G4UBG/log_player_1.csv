{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $140."", 
""product_price"": 140

* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:** John acts as a safety net, guaranteeing you $100.

By offering the product at $140, you're:

* **Staying Above Your Minimum:** You're well above your $100 minimum.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, Bob might counter-offer, giving you a chance to potentially secure an even better deal."
