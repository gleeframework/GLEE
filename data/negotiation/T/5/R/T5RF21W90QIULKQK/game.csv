"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me.  How about we start the negotiations at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $850,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, it's a starting point. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects the value I place on the product, and I believe it's a fair price considering its potential for you. ",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $950,000 is closer, but still a bit beyond my budget.  Would you consider $890,000?  I think that's a fair compromise.",890000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $890,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to achieve my target.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's settle at $920,000. It's a fair price, and we can finalize this deal. ",920000.0,Alice,5,
