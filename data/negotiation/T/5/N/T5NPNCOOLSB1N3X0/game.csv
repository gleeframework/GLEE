"Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $1,800,000 is way too high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for this product. It's a fair price considering its potential value to my business.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to find a fair deal for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $1,400,000 is still beyond what I'm comfortable paying. Let's try to meet in the middle â€“ I can offer $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,4,
