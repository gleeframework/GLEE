Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This gives me a good margin above my minimum value and leaves room for negotiation. I believe Bob might be willing to pay a higher price for the product, but I want to gauge his interest first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's higher than my minimum value, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price of $10,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $9,500. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves room for a good profit. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and come closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still not my desired price, it's a good compromise. It's a bit lower than my last counteroffer but it's still higher than John's offer, and it's closer to my minimum value than I thought I could achieve. I'm confident I can get a better deal next time."
