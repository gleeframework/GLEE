"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a substantial discount.  A $100,000 reduction is a good starting point to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still likely get a better deal. There's a reasonable chance Alice will accept a counteroffer closer to Bob's previous offer, and it's worth trying to save an additional $50,000.  The risk of losing the deal to John is still low at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now splitting the difference between his last offer and Alice's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a good deal. This offer should be attractive to Alice, as it's a smaller jump from her previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $940,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's last offer, and at $940,000, the price is very close to what Bob wants. It's unlikely that further negotiation will result in a significantly lower price.  There's a good chance Alice will hold firm at this price.  

Since Bob has 5 rounds remaining, the risk of losing the deal to John is not too high.  However, the potential gains from further negotiation are limited. Accepting this offer secures a good deal with less risk of missing out."
