"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get the product for a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $1,200,000?  I'm confident this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1200000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Considering the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $1300000.  This price is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to achieve a more reasonable profit.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still better than John's.**  Buying from Alice for $1,300,000 saves Bob $200,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **There's a risk of further negotiation.** While Bob might be able to get a slightly lower price, there's no guarantee.  Alice may reject further counteroffers and Bob might end up paying more or having to buy from John.
* **$1,300,000 is a good compromise.**  It's a fair price for both parties, allowing Bob to save money while still securing the product."
