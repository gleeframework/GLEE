,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $200 is a bit out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $120 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand that $200 is a bit steep. How about we meet in the middle at $170? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value you're getting.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $170 is still a bit higher than what I can afford right now.  How about we split the difference at $145?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",145.0,Bob,4,
