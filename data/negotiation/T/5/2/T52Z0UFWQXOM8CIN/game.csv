"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,625,000?  This price still gives you a significant advantage, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1625000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1,625,000 is still above my preferred price point, I believe we can find common ground. How about $1,575,000? This would allow us to move forward while keeping the transaction within my budget.",1575000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,575,000 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down slightly more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair return on this unique product.  How about $1,600,000? This is a significant compromise on my end, and it gives you a very good deal. Let's try to reach an agreement this round.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
