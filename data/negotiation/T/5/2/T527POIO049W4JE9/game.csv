"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $8,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere, say around $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $12,000 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget.  Would you consider $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're getting closer! I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $9,500 is still a tough sell.  Could you do $11,000?  That's a significant discount from my initial asking price.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $11,000 is tempting, but I'm really trying to stay closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,6,
