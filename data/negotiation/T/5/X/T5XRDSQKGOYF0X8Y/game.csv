"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring you significant value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you have a budget in mind, Bob, but I'm afraid $10000 is a bit low considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm willing to pay $11500. I think this is a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $11500 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of $14000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're not willing to go any lower, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000, which is the highest I can go. I hope you can understand my position.",12000.0,Bob,6,
