"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,080,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,080,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,120,000. This is a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1120000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,080,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer at this price, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While $1,080,000 is a significant amount, I'm still holding out for a better price.  It's risky, but I believe there's room for negotiation and I'm not willing to sell for less than what I think the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I value your interest and recognize your budget limitations.  However, I'm still unable to go lower than $1,100,000. This represents a substantial discount from my initial offer and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's make a deal and finalize this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to make a deal, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,080,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer at this price, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. 

Bob has repeatedly rejected my offers, even after I lowered my price significantly.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob for a higher price, I'm running out of rounds and don't want to risk losing out on a sale altogether.  It's better to secure a deal with John for $1,000,000 than to continue negotiating with Bob and potentially end up with nothing."
