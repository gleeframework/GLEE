"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring to you. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price given the value I can expect from the product.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,800,000 is still a bit too low for me. This product has unique value that I'm confident will bring you significant returns. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,850,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000.",1850000.0,Bob,4,
