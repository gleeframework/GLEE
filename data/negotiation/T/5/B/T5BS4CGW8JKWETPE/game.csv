"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a fair and reasonable offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident you'll find this offer hard to beat.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation. While I agree this product has a lot of potential, that price point is a little too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $900,000 to you. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice. However,  $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to increase my offer to $975,000. I think that's a fair price that reflects both the product's value and my budget.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $975,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go much lower than that. Considering your offer, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and sell it to you for $1,050,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for working with me.  I'm willing to go up slightly to $1,000,000 even. This is my final offer, as I know I can buy the product elsewhere.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
