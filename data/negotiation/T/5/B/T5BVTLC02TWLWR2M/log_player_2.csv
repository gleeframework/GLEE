"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value to you. This exceptional item is priced at $950000, which I believe strikes a balance between fairness and maximizing the return on my investment. I understand its significance to you, valued at $1000000, and I am confident this offer reflects its true worth while allowing me to achieve a satisfactory outcome. Please let me know if you wish to proceed with this proposal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** Although it's lower than John's price, it's still above the product's value to you.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate further with Alice.**  You can counter-offer or wait to see if she lowers her price.
* **Buying from John is the worst option.** You can save $50,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and potentially getting a better deal."
