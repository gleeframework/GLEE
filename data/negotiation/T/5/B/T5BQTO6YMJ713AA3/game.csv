"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $13000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm now offering the product to you for $16000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $14000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $15500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $15500 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $15000.  This is a fair price considering the value we've both placed on the product. I hope we can reach an agreement.",15000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm getting close to accepting your offer, but I still need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $15000 and my original offer. I'm now offering the product to you for $15250. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",15250.0,Alice,7,
