Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your $1,200,000 floor.
* **It's below Bob's value:** This leaves room for negotiation and potential compromise.
* **It's clear and concise:**  The message is straightforward and avoids unnecessary details."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth the full $1,400,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, you can still potentially earn more.  By rejecting his offer, you can try to get closer to your desired price point.  Here's why it makes sense to keep negotiating:

* **Potential for higher profit:**  Bob acknowledges the value of the product and is willing to pay more than your fallback price. This indicates room for negotiation. 
* **Avoiding a hasty decision:** Selling at the minimum might seem safe, but it's not necessarily the best strategy.  You can use this opportunity to test the limits of Bob's willingness to pay. 

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to craft a counteroffer to Bob that's both attractive and maintains your bargaining position.  A counteroffer of $1,300,000 could be a good starting point, demonstrating your willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,200,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,300,000? That's still a great value for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. "", ""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to meet Bob halfway, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Still above your minimum:**  $1,300,000 is still above your minimum price, so you're not losing out.
* **Focus on value:**  The message emphasizes the value Bob will get at this price, making it more appealing to him. 

This counteroffer balances the need to be firm about your price with the desire to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is just $50,000 above your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for a quick deal:**  Accepting this offer avoids further negotiation and potentially a stalemate. 
* **Risk of a lower offer:** If you reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob might lower his offer again or even walk away from the deal, leaving you with John's offer of $1,200,000.

**Conclusion:**

While you might prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer is a reasonable strategy. It secures a sale that's close to your minimum, minimizes the risk of further negotiation, and ensures a quick transaction."
