"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm not sure it's worth the full $1,400,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,200,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,300,000? That's still a great value for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. ",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
