Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $760,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $795,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While we could try to push Alice further down, $795,000 is a reasonable price and saves us $205,000 off Alice's initial offer.  It's only $5,000 more than John's offer, and further haggling might make Alice less willing to negotiate.  It's better to secure a good deal now."
