"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in this product, but $1100000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for it.  I believe this price is fair considering the value I see in this product and my budget constraints. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However,  $1075000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone. I'm happy to meet you in the middle and offer $1025000.  I believe this represents a fair value for both of us and gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob! I understand that you're trying to find a balance between value and budget. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering the product to you for $1060000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1060000.0,Alice,5,
