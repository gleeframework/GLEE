Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $8,000 to you, and I'm sure you'll get great use out of it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $12,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price.  John is always an option, but I want to explore all possibilities with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm happy to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $9,500?  It's still a good value for you, and it gives me some breathing room."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $9,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I'm confident that I can push Bob a little further and get closer to my target price.  John is a safe option, but I want to see if I can secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  $9,000 is a good offer, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This represents a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch to. Can you meet me at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is the highest he's offered so far, and it's a decent compromise considering we're both willing to meet in the middle.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial price, we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John.  $9,000 is a good deal, and I'm happy to accept it."
