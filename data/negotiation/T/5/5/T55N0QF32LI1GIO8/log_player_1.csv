Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **High Starting Point:** Starting at $19,000 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Exclusive Opportunity:**  Framing it as an ""exclusive opportunity"" adds perceived value and might make Bob more inclined to accept.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your knowledge of Bob's negotiating style and how much you want to prioritize a quick sale, you could adjust the price and message."
