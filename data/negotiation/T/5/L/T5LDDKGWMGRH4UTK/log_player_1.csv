"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high price, hoping to get as much as possible. This is a good starting point as it allows for negotiation and leaves room for compromise. I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,200,000 to me, so I'm starting with a margin for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'll reject this and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm reducing my offer to $1,250,000, which is still a bit higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This is a compromise, but I'm still aiming for a deal that's closer to my initial asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not willing to go lower than $1,200,000, so I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further.  I'm still confident that I can get a better price, and I'm not desperate to sell yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

I'm willing to lower my price again to $1,150,000. This shows flexibility, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to what I believe the product is worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower, but I'm still not ready to accept it. I believe we can still reach a compromise and I'm not yet ready to sell to John for $1,200,000. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again to $1,050,000. This is a significant concession, but I'm hoping to entice Bob to make a better counteroffer. The deal is getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still holding out for a better outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting very low, and with only two rounds remaining, it's unlikely we'll reach an agreement.  I'm not comfortable accepting such a low price, and I'm running out of time.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000 to guarantee a sale and avoid risking losing the deal completely."
