"I'm interested in the product, but $950000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850000. Can you consider this price?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I have to consider the value I've attached to it, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $900000, but I'm not going any lower than that. Is this a price you're comfortable with?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $900000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer $875000. Can you consider this price?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can offer you the product for $880000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",880000.0,Alice,5,

"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already made some significant concessions, and I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'm willing to meet you at $870000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If we can't meet at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.",870000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer of $860000. If that's not acceptable, I'll need to reconsider my options. Can you consider this price?",860000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob, but I've already made a significant concession by offering it to you for $870000.
