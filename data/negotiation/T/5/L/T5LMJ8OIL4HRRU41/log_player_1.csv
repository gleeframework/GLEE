Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,500,000) without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting a bit higher allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** While we have a guaranteed sale with John, Bob offers a significantly higher potential profit, making him the priority.

**The message is crafted to be:**

* **Direct:** Clearly stating the purpose of the communication.
* **Appealing:**  Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and emphasizing the product's value specifically to Bob. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  Inviting Bob's feedback and potential negotiation with ""What are your thoughts?"""
