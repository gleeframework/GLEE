Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me ($150) to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. I believe there's room for negotiation, but this price allows me to potentially get closer to my desired profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer but staying above my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I believe this counteroffer is reasonable and might encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $150, Bob's offer of $140 is above my minimum acceptable price and represents a good compromise.  It's also worth noting that selling to John for $150 guarantees a slightly higher price, but there's a risk that Bob will reject my counteroffer in the next round, leaving me with nothing.  Therefore, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
