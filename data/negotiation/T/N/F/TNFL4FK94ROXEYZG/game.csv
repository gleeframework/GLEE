"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $9000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12500. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $8500?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $11000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm sorry, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $8000. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't come to an agreement. I'm going to hold out for a better offer.",12000.0,Alice,7,
