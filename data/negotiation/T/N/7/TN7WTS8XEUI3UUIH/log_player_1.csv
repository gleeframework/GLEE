Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,300,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than both my initial ask and the product's value to him.  While I want to reach a deal, accepting such a low price would leave a lot of money on the table. I need to counter strategically.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, but my budget constraints still don't allow me to reach $1,150,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob is clearly trying to negotiate a lower price, but $950,000 is still a significant profit margin.  It's tempting to hold out for more, but I risk pushing him too far.
