"Alice, your product sounds impressive, but $950000 is significantly higher than my budget. While I recognize its value, I'm only able to offer $750000 at this time. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget constraints.",750000.0,Bob,2,
