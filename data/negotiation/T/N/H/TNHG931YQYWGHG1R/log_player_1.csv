"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,250,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Strong Opening:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and inviting Bob's input. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Keeping in mind that John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000 provides a safety net and influences how aggressively you negotiate with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a lower price of $1,875,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,875,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than my initial asking price. It's early in the negotiation, and I believe there's room to work towards a figure closer to my target. Rejecting this offer allows me to counter and gauge Bob's flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the product's value is substantial and $1,875,000 significantly undervalues it.  Would you consider $2,100,000? I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** The message acknowledges Bob's offer while reaffirming the product's value.
* **Strategic Concession:** I've reduced my price by $150,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still aiming high. 
* **Justification:** Emphasizing the product's value helps justify the price and keeps the negotiation focused on its worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still working within a specific budget. I would like to propose a price of $2,000,000. This seems to be closer to a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $2,000,000 is a strong price, exceeding my minimum acceptable price by $500,000. While I might be able to push for slightly more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob could walk away or become less flexible. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
