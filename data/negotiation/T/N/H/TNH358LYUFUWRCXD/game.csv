,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12,000. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $12,000 is still too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product but I can't go beyond $9,000.  Let's try to reach a deal closer to this price.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $10,500, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, $10,500 is still a bit more than I can afford. I'm prepared to pay $9,500 for the product. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering your own value for the item.  Let's try to find a middle ground here.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, which is a compromise on my end. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you and my own costs.",10000.0,Alice,7,
