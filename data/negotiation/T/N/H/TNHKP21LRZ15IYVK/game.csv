"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $13250? I think that's as low as I can go.",13250.0,Alice,7,

"I'm getting a bit frustrated, Bob. I've made several concessions, and I'm starting to think we're not going to meet on price. However, I'm still willing to try to close the deal. I'll meet you at $13250, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to sell to someone else.",13250.0,Alice,9,

"Alice, I understand you're getting frustrated, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you at $13000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to sell it to me at that price, I'll have to consider buying it from someone else.",13000.0,Bob,10,
