Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $10000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down to $17000 to show my commitment to this deal.  This reflects a considerable discount from my initial offer. Let's see if we can find common ground.
