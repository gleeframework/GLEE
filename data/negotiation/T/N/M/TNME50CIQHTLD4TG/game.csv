"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $20000. This is a fair price considering its unique qualities and potential. Let me know what you think!",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be happy to offer you $10000 for it.  This seems like a fair price considering my budget and the fact that I'm your first potential buyer. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $10000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down to $17000 to show my commitment to this deal.  This reflects a considerable discount from my initial offer. Let's see if we can find common ground.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $17000 is still a little too high for my budget. How about we split the difference and settle on $13500? I'm confident this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $13500 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $15500 as a final offer. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product and allows us to reach an agreement. If you're not able to meet this price, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers.",15500.0,Alice,5,
