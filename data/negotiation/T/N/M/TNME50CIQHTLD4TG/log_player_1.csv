Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be happy to offer you $10000 for it.  This seems like a fair price considering my budget and the fact that I'm your first potential buyer. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
