"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, and I'm open to discussing the details further.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in the product, $1,500,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to consider a price closer to $1,100,000, reflecting the value I see in it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,100,000 falls short of what I had in mind.  To move this forward, I'd be willing to consider $1,350,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise, reflecting the product's true potential.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,350,000 is still too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's try $1,200,000.  This price represents a significant investment for me, and I'm hopeful we can reach a deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
