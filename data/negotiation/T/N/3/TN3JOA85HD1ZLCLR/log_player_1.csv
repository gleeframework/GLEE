Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a better deal.  I'll be closely watching Bob's response and adjusting my strategy based on his counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'm open to negotiation, $800,000 is too far off. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm countering with $1,200,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise. However, it's still above my minimum threshold, leaving space for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob has come up slightly with his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I don't want to risk going back and forth with Bob any further and potentially ending up with a lower price than John is offering. Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,000,000, which is my minimum goal."
