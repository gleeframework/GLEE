"Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we split the difference and go with $12,500? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value you've placed on the product. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $12,250. I think this is a fair price considering the value I've placed on the product.",12250.0,Bob,4,
