Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to try to get as close to the value of the product as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

The product is worth $12,000 to me, and I can get that from John. Bob's offer is lower than that, so I will reject it and see if I can get a better price."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $11,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we split the difference and go with $12,500? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value you've placed on the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
