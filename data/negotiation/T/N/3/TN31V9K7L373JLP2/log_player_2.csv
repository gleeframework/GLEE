"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $22,000 is far beyond your budget of $8,000. It's not even close to your maximum.  You should reject the offer and counter with a price closer to your maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $22,000 is way above my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $8,000.  Let me know if that's something you're willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This would represent a substantial discount from my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $18,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still well above your budget. You should reject this offer and continue to negotiate. Even though you can buy from John for $8,000, it's worth exploring if you can get closer to that price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $18,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  This is a fair compromise given the value we both see in this product.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the gap between our valuations is still quite significant. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is my absolute bottom line. I believe this is a very fair offer considering the true worth of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is still above your budget. While it's closer to your maximum than her previous offers, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation.  You can get the product for $8,000 from John, which is a much better deal.  It's time to move on and secure the purchase with John."
