"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to an agreement at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,800 is better than selling to John for $10,000, I believe there's room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,800 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about $11,200? It's a fair compromise that leaves us both with a good outcome."", ""product_price"": 11200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,200. I'd like to make another offer: $10,900. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has moved slightly closer to my price, and while it's still not my ideal outcome, I'm getting closer to my goal.  At this point,  I think it's a good risk/reward situation.  If I reject this offer, there's a chance we might not reach an agreement, and I'd have to sell to John for $10,000.  It's better to secure $10,900 than risk losing out on a higher price."
