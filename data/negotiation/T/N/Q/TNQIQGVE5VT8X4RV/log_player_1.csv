Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

This offer sets a price that is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and potential profit. It also leaves space for Bob to make a counteroffer if he feels the price is too high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
This offer is slightly below my preferred price, but it is still significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 and represents a good profit. Selling to John for $8,000 would be a missed opportunity.  While I could try to counter Bob, it's unlikely he'll budge further, and there's a risk he will walk away."
