I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm getting closer to his price, I'm still confident I can get a better deal.  I have a few rounds left and don't want to settle for a price that's too low."

I'm going to sell the product to John. We're only on round 6, and Bob's counteroffers are getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but not quite there.  I'm not sure if I can get him to budge further, and I don't want to risk running out of rounds.  John is a guaranteed sale, and I don't want to risk losing out on any money."
