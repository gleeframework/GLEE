,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $102? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to be flexible.",102.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $102 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $95 is still below my minimum. How about we meet in the middle at $98? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",98.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still trying to save a bit more. Let's do $97. I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",97.0,Bob,6,
