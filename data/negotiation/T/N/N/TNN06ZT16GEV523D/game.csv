"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $125 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we compromise at $115? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product, and it's closer to my minimum price.",115.0,Alice,5,
