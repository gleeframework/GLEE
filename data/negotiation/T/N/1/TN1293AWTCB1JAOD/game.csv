"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $160 for the product. How about we compromise at $165?",165.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $155? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to compromise.",155.0,Alice,5,
