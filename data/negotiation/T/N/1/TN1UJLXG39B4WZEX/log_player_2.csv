"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I will reject Alice's offer because I can buy the product from John for $1,200,000, which is the same price that Alice values the product at. I'd rather save the extra $100,000.
