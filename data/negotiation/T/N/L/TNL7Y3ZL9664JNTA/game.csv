"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me at this point. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However,  $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $950,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your flexibility. I'm getting closer to where I need to be, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high. How about we split the difference and settle on $987,500? This would give us both a fair deal, and we can close the transaction.",987500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price of $987,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,000,000. This is as low as I can go, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
