"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to me is at least $1200000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $1200000 is a significant amount, but I'm still a bit hesitant to sell it at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1350000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1250000. Can you meet me at this price?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make another compromise. However, I'm not willing to go below $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $1325000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal. What do you think?",1325000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I can only go up to $1250000. Is there any room for negotiation?",1250000.0,Bob,6,
