"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm not willing to sell the product for Bob's offer. I will counter with a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:

I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low.  This product is truly unique and offers exceptional value. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it for $1,350,000. It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is unique, Alice, but I've done my research and I'm not convinced it's worth $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is the price I initially mentioned. If you're not willing to go any lower, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is insistent on his price and I've already made several counteroffers.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $1,200,000.  It's not my ideal price, but it's better than risking further negotiation with Bob and potentially getting a worse deal."
