"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,200,000  is considerably below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this price point better reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good price for the product, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $2,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,500,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
