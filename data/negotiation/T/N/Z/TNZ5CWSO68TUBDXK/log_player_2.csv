Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing a gap between our valuations. I'm willing to make a final offer at $950,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a more than fair deal.

While Alice is coming down, it's unlikely she'll go below $800,000.  Cutting your losses and buying from John guarantees you get the product at your target price."
