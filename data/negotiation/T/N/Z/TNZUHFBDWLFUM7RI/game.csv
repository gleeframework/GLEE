"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to offer the product for $900,000. This reflects its inherent worth while acknowledging your interest.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $650,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but we're still quite far apart on price. I'm willing to move down slightly to $850,000.  This offer reflects my strong desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement while ensuring the product's value is recognized.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $680,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",680000.0,Bob,6,
