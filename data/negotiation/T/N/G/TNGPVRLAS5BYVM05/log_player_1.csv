Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your starting price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is too low for me to consider.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $750,000.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's clear he's trying to lowball me. I have a guaranteed offer for $800,000 from John, and it's not worth my time to continue haggling with Bob when I can get my minimum acceptable price elsewhere."
