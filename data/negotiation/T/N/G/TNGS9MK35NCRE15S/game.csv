"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me right now.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $650,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While I think the product is great, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could you consider $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $725,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $950,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you.",950000.0,Alice,5,
