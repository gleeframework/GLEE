"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,300,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but the product is worth significantly more than your offer. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,900,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my offer of $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're close to a deal. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,750,000. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
