"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $50
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth no more than $100 to Bob. Alice's offer of $50 is a good price, but there's always a chance to get it for even less. By rejecting and counteroffering, Bob can try to negotiate a lower price and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 40} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to maximize his savings. He starts by offering $40, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial price of $50. This aggressive counteroffer aims to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially secure a deal quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $45. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $45
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $45 is a good compromise. While Bob initially aimed for a lower price, it's becoming clear that Alice is willing to negotiate but not go much lower.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product for a price he's comfortable with and avoid the risk of further negotiation leading to a higher price or a deal falling through."
