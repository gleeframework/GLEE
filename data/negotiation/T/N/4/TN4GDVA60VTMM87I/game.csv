"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,275,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1,275,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,225,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1225000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm keen on finding an agreement that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $1,250,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the product's inherent value.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
