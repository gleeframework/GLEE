"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a great deal for you, as the product is worth $1,000,000 to you. Let me know what you think.",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,200,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This would still give you a great value for the product. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $1,250,000? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my financial constraints.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a significant distance from what I need to make this deal work. How about we split the difference and agree on $1,350,000? This would be a great deal for both of us, giving you a strong value for the product and me a price closer to my target.  Let's see if we can close this deal now.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from the last offer, so how about $1,300,000? I think this is a fair price for the product and would allow us to close the deal.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  I'm going to come down just a bit more, to $1,325,000. This is a compromise on my end, but I need to get a price closer to my minimum.  If you're serious about this deal, I think this is our best chance to close.",1325000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but I think I can do a bit better than that. How about $1,275,000? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",1275000.0,Bob,8,
