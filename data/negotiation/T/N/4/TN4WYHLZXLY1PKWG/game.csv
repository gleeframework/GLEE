"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,500? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,200? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us.",9200.0,Bob,6,
