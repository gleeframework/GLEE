"I'm not sure we're getting any closer, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $138 and my last offer, so I'll do $140, but that's it.",140.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Considering our previous discussions, I believe $137 would be a reasonable price for both parties involved. I hope you can accept this offer.",137.0,Bob,10,
