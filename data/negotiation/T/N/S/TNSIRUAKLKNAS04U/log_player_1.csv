"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay more than my minimum of $80. I'm also making it clear that I believe the product is valuable and that he'd benefit from it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to try and counteroffer with a price closer to my original offer of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. How about we split the difference and go with $95? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering $95, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility while still trying to get closer to my desired price. I'm also emphasizing the fairness of the offer and highlighting the potential benefits of the product for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $85 is very close to my minimum, but I'm still hoping to get a slightly better price. I'm going to try to counter with something in between $85 and my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $85 is still a bit below what I can accept at this point. I'm willing to come down to $87, which is a fair compromise. Let's finalize this deal, I'm confident you'll love the product."", ""product_price"": 87}
```

I'm offering $87, which is halfway between my minimum and Bob's last offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise but still trying to get as much as possible.  I'm also trying to close the deal by emphasizing that it's a fair compromise and that Bob will be happy with the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $82? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $80. While Bob's offer of $82 is closer to my minimum than John's, I'm running out of time and negotiating rounds. It's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob, potentially leading to a rejected counteroffer and a missed opportunity to sell to John.  I'm comfortable selling to John for $80, as it meets my minimum requirement."
