Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the conversation.  While I see the value in this product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
