"Hey Alice, $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference at $9,250? This would still be a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my desired price. Let me know what you think.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $9,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
