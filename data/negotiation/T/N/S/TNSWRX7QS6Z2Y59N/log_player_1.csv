Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $10,000 is higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:** $10,000 is lower than your minimum price, giving you some buffer to potentially negotiate down.
* **It's a strong opening:**  It shows you're confident in the product's value while leaving room for Bob to counter. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit while keeping the negotiation open!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than your minimum price. It's worth trying to negotiate further.  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation going and gives you a chance to make a counteroffer that might be more appealing to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference at $9,250? This would still be a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my desired price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $9,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Here's why accepting Bob's offer is the best decision:

* **Close to your minimum:** $9,000 is just a bit below your minimum of $12,000. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While you might be able to squeeze out another $100 or $200, it's unlikely you'll get significantly closer to your $12,000 goal. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If you reject and make another counteroffer, there's a chance Bob will walk away, and you'll be stuck selling to John for $12,000. 

It's a good deal for both of you, and securing the sale now is the most sensible option."
