"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm confident you'll get great value out of it.  I'm asking for $20,000, which reflects the true value of this item. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. While I appreciate its value, $20,000 is a bit too steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, however, $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to part with. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This would be a fair price considering the value this product offers.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. However, $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $12,000?  I feel that's a reasonable compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for your persistence. I'm motivated to sell this, but I need a price that makes it worthwhile for me. Could you consider $14,500? That's a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to make a deal happen.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we both want to make a deal.  I could stretch my budget to $13,000.  That's a big jump for me, but I believe this product is worth it.  What do you say?",13000.0,Bob,6,
