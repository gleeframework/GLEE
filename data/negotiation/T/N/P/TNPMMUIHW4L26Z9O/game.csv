"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its features and benefits, I'm offering it at $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you bringing this product to my attention. While it seems like a great product, $9,500 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Would you be open to that?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers you significant value, and I'm confident you'll see a great return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I value the product, $9,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to invest and you to make a good sale. What do you think?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your perspective and your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go as low as $8,750. Would you be willing to meet at $8,900?  I think that's a fair offer considering the value this product brings.",8900.0,Alice,5,
