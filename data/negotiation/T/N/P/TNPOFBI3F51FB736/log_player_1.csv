"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation.  I'll see how Bob responds before making any further adjustments."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $100 is too low for me, as it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm counteroffering at $130. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob while still giving me a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not happy with it. I'll counteroffer again in the next round, hoping to close the deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm offering $125 in this round. It's a compromise, a step closer to Bob's last offer, but still gives me a profit. With only five rounds left, I'm hoping this will be agreeable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only four rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate with Bob. While $115 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not sure if we can reach a higher price in the remaining rounds. I'm going to sell the product to John for $120 to ensure I get my minimum profit."
