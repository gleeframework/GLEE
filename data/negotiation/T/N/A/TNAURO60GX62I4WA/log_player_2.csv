{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

There's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer at this point.  Since you're aiming to save money, rejecting and making a counteroffer is the logical first step. It allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant counteroffer of $1,000,000 sets the tone for negotiation.  It's a bold move that shows you're serious about getting a good deal, and leaves room for negotiation.  While it's unlikely Alice will accept this immediately, it's a strong starting point."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still not a great deal for you.  You're still paying more than you would like.  It's best to continue negotiating and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate. A counteroffer of $1,100,000 shows you're serious about getting a good price but are also willing to be reasonable. This keeps the pressure on Alice without being too aggressive."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your target price, but there's still room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer allows you to try and squeeze out a little more savings. It's important to keep pushing for the best possible deal within your budget."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1110000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close to a potential agreement. This counteroffer of $1,110,000 is a small increase from your previous offer, showing you are serious about reaching a deal but are still pushing for a better price.  It's a subtle move that might just be enough to convince Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,130,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,130,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your desired price, but you only have a few rounds left. While you could keep trying for a lower price, accepting this offer is a good compromise. It secures the product for you at a decent price, saving you $90,000 compared to John's offer, and leaves you with some room to potentially negotiate on future purchases or terms.  The risk of continuing to negotiate is that you could reach the end of the rounds and be forced to buy from John at a higher price."
