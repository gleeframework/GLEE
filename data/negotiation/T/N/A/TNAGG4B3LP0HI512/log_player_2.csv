"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for as low as possible, ideally below $8,000. Alice's initial offer of $10,000 is too high. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still higher than Bob's target of $8,000.  Since Bob has 7 rounds remaining, it's worth continuing to negotiate.  There's a chance Alice will lower the price further.  Also, if Bob rejects the offer, he can make a counteroffer, which could potentially lead to a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that considers both our needs."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer you the product for $9,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to get the product for as low as possible. While $9,250 is closer to his target of $8,000, he can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. There are 5 rounds remaining, which is enough time to explore further price reductions.  Additionally, if Bob rejects this offer, he can make a counteroffer, which may lead to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This is a fair compromise, considering I can get the same product for $8,000 elsewhere.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $9,100. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has stated that $9,100 is her lowest acceptable price. While Bob could continue to negotiate, there are only 3 rounds left.  It's unlikely Alice will come down to $8,000. Since Bob can buy the same product from John for $8,000, it makes more sense to accept John's offer and end the negotiations with Alice.  This guarantees Bob gets the product at his target price and saves valuable time."
