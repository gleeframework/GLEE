Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential surplus of $500,000 to be split.
* **One Shot:** You only have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you go with John.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to capture as much of that $500,000 surplus as possible while still ensuring Bob finds the deal acceptable.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,350,000 is a strong starting point. It leaves you with a significant profit margin above your minimum while still offering Bob a substantial discount compared to his valuation. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" subtly reminds Bob of what's at stake if he declines. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** While this is your initial offer, the wording leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he wishes.

**Important Notes:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style. If you knew he was very aggressive, you might start lower to avoid scaring him off.
* **Alternative Offers:** There are many other valid offers within the range. You could experiment with slightly higher or lower prices depending on your risk tolerance."
