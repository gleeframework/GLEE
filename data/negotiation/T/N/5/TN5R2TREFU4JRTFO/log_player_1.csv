"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still above my minimum acceptable price. This should encourage him to negotiate, but hopefully not so much that he walks away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price, but it's not unreasonable. I'm going to reject his offer for now and try to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I have 9 more rounds to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still looking for something a bit closer to $135.  This is a fantastic product, and I'm confident you'll get great value for your money. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm adjusting my price slightly to meet Bob halfway, hoping to find a middle ground that we can both agree on. I'm still above my minimum acceptable price, but showing flexibility to encourage a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $130 is a more reasonable price for me. Can you meet me at that number? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, and it's only round 4. Accepting his offer will secure a good deal, and I'm not willing to risk losing the deal altogether by continuing to negotiate."
