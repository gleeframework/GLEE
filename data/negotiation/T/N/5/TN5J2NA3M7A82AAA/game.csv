"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Could we settle around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. Considering your offer of $700,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to make another concession and propose a new counteroffer of $825,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we are getting closer.  My final offer is $780,000.  Let me know if this works for you.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm surprised you're willing to go as high as $780,000. I'm going to make one more counteroffer, and then I'll have to consider other options. I propose a final counteroffer of $815,000. This is the absolute highest I'm willing to go.",815000.0,Alice,7,
