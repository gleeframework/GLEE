Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not quite there. Considering the product's value to you and the concessions I've made so far, I'm willing to meet you at $795,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good point to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Price:** $795,000 is a significant savings compared to her initial offer and only $5,000 less than John's price.
* **Time:** You've already used 7 rounds of negotiation. Continuing might not yield a much better result from Alice, and it risks her withdrawing the offer altogether.
* **Finality:** Alice has presented this as her final offer.  Trying to haggle further might damage the relationship and make her less likely to negotiate in good faith."
