Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer from another interested party."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, it's always best to try and get the highest possible price. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product to Bob at $1,450,000 creates a sense of urgency and value. It's significantly less than John's offer, making it attractive to Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, Bob might try to negotiate further, and starting at $1,450,000 gives us some wiggle room without dropping below our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
