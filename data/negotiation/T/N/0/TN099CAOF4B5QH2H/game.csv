"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you a lot of value. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000 for the product.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it and allows for some room for negotiation.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $11,000 for the product. It's still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $8,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident that this product will be a valuable asset for me.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're firm on $8,500, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $10,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value I've already added to it, and I believe it's a price you can live with.",10000.0,Alice,5,
