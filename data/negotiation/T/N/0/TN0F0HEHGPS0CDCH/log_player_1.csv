"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. It's a great deal, considering it's worth $120 to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him to make the offer seem more attractive.
* **Open to negotiation:** My message implies that I'm open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer if he's not happy with the initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $90 for the product, considering it's worth $80 to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe I can still get a better price, especially since Bob acknowledged the product is worth $80 to me, indicating he's willing to pay more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit more. How about $95? It's still a good deal for you, and we can close this quickly."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offering:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but making a counteroffer to keep the negotiation going.
* **Reasonable increase:** My counteroffer is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, showing I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a higher price.
* **Urgency:**  I'm emphasizing the potential for a quick deal to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $92 for the product, but I'm still a bit far from your original offer. Can we meet in the middle at $92.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $92.50 is very close to my desired price and represents a good compromise.  It's a significant increase from his previous offer, and it's only a few dollars less than my last counteroffer. 

At this point, I'm willing to accept the offer to avoid further negotiation and the risk of losing a potential buyer."
