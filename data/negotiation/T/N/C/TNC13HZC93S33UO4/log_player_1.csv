I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's value, hoping to leave room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially earn more while still considering John's offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

Bob's offer is below my minimum value.  While I want to make a sale, I'm not willing to go below $120.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $115? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still below. I want to see if I can push for a bit more, and I'm comfortable with potentially selling to John as a backup.  I'll counteroffer again."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, $115 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125, which is a fair compromise. This price still allows me to make a decent profit, and I believe it's a great value for you as well. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 125}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $125, which would be $122.50. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122.5

Bob's offer is just above my minimum value.  It's not ideal, but it's a good deal considering I could sell to John for $120.  I'll accept and move on."
