"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $15000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for the product, as I mentioned earlier. If you're willing to sell it to me for that price, I'd be happy to make a deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
