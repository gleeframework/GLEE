Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. It's a fantastic deal on a product I know you're interested in."",
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay even more. 
* **High but Believable:**  $11,999 is a high price, but it's just under your guaranteed sale price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer but ensures you don't lose money if he rejects it.
* **Positive Language:** The message uses positive language to highlight the ""opportunity"" and ""fantastic deal,"" subtly encouraging Bob to accept."
