"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob can get a better deal than $1,200,000. He knows the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can start a counteroffer process and potentially get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Given the value of the product to you, I'd be willing to pay $950,000. This is a fair price that allows you to make a profit and me to secure the product for a reasonable price."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1050000 is my final offer. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while offering you a significant discount from my initial offer. I'm confident this is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

While $1,050,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still do better. He knows the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can counteroffer again and hopefully get closer to his desired price."
