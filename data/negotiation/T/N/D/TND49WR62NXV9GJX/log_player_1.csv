"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob.  This is a common tactic in negotiations to see if there's room for a compromise. If he rejects this offer, we can then see how much he's willing to pay and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $140 is better than what I would get if I sold to John, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if I can push Bob a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate to sell. This might push Bob closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's still not my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150.  There's no guarantee that I'll be able to get a higher price in the next round, and I'm concerned that continuing to negotiate might lead to a deadlock, forcing me to sell to John for less.  $145 is a good compromise that allows me to move on from this negotiation."
