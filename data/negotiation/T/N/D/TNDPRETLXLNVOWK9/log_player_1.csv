"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $160 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your desired selling point. This gives you room to negotiate and appear flexible.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $160, you're setting a high anchor. Even though Bob's value is $80, this high starting point might make a counteroffer closer to your desired range seem more reasonable. 
* **Leaving Room:**  The large gap between the initial offer and your minimum allows for multiple rounds of counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $160 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Bob's Value:** Bob's offer of $100 is higher than his perceived value of the product ($80), indicating he's willing to stretch a bit.
* **Below Your Minimum:** Accepting $100 would mean selling below your minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still room to negotiate between Bob's offer and your minimum. You can try to meet closer to the middle or employ other negotiation tactics."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $130?"", ""product_price"": 130}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This approach aims to appear fair and willing to compromise while still staying above your minimum price.
* **Incremental Concessions:**  You've come down from your initial offer, signaling flexibility.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This offer will help gauge Bob's true willingness to pay. If he accepts, you've secured a good deal. If he rejects it, you'll have more information to decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $130 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Your Minimum:** Bob's offer of $110 is above your absolute minimum of $120. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield a few more dollars. It's often better to secure a good deal than to risk losing it altogether. 
* **Time Value:**  Each round of negotiation takes time. Accepting now allows you to move on to other opportunities."
