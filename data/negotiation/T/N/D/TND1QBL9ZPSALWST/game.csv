"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a rare and valuable item. I'm thinking of a price of $25000 for it. Is this something you'd like to consider?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $25000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this item, but my budget is limited to $8000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss a price of $18000? This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the item and the market demand.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18000 is still above my budget. I'm firm on my offer of $8000. This is a fair price considering the value I'm willing to place on this item.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not on the same page, Bob. I've already met you halfway, and you're still not budging. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $12000? This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my costs.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $12000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to stick with my original offer of $8000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll unfortunately have to go with John's offer.",8000.0,Bob,6,
