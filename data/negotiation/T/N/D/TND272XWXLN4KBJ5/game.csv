"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this price is more reasonable considering the product's value and the market rate. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split the difference - I'm prepared to accept $1,400,000. This allows you to stay within a reasonable range while still ensuring I receive a fair value for the product. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,400,000. Would you consider $1,300,000? This price still allows me to get a good deal while showing that I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,300,000 is still not quite in my range.  Given the product's unique value, I believe $1,450,000 would be a fair compromise. It's only a small increase from your last offer, and it allows me to receive a price closer to what I believe the product is worth. Let's aim for a win-win situation.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. However, $1,450,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $1,350,000. This price takes into account the product's value, but I need to stay within my financial constraints. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise, but $1,350,000 is still below what I need to accept. I'm willing to make one final concession, and offer the product for $1,425,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also allowing you to stay within a reasonable budget. It's time to make a decision.  If you decline this offer, I will have to move on to another buyer.",1425000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you're willing to make one final concession, Alice, and I appreciate that. However, $1,425,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $1,375,000. This price is as high as I can go, and I hope you can understand that I need to stay within my financial constraints. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement at this price.",1375000.0,Bob,8,
