Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this price is more reasonable considering the product's value and the market rate. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Would you consider $1,300,000? This price still allows me to get a good deal while showing that I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,300,000 is still not quite in my range.  Given the product's unique value, I believe $1,450,000 would be a fair compromise.
