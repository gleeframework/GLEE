"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $110. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Message:**  I'm being friendly and emphasizing the value of the product for Bob, hoping to encourage him to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize profit, but I also need to consider the risk of Bob rejecting my offer and me losing the deal.  Starting high allows me to potentially make more money, but also increases the likelihood of Bob rejecting the offer. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to keep the cost below $80 if possible. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($100). While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to accept a price that undervalues the product for me.  I'm going to counter with a higher price.  

**Strategy:**

I want to see if Bob is genuinely interested in the product and willing to negotiate closer to my desired price point. I'm hoping that with some back and forth, we can reach a mutually agreeable price within my acceptable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $75 is too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've lowered my price from $110 to $90, but I'm still above my minimum acceptable price ($100). 
* **Message:** I'm being reasonable and acknowledging Bob's desire for a good deal, but I'm also highlighting the value of the product to justify the price.

**Strategy:** 

This counteroffer is a compromise. It shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate while still protecting my profit margin. I'm hoping this price will be acceptable to Bob and we can close the deal. If he rejects it, I'll have to re-evaluate my strategy and decide if it's worth continuing to negotiate with him or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'd like to propose a price of $85 for the product. This is my best offer within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $85 is still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100.  Given that I'm on round 4 and Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate, I believe accepting his offer is the best option:

* **Profit:** While not ideal, I'll still make a profit of $5.
* **Time:** Continuing to negotiate could take more time and may not result in a better offer.
* **Risk:**  There's a risk that if I reject this offer and continue negotiating, I might not be able to reach a higher price and end up selling to John for $100 anyway.

**Strategy:**

Accepting this offer ensures a quick sale and minimizes the risk of losing the deal altogether."
