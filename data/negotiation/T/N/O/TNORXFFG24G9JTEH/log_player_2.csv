"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a better price than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best possible deal.  He knows the product is worth $10,000 to Alice.  He starts with a counteroffer of $10,500, which is halfway between Alice's offer and the product's worth to her.  This shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a significant saving."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, and $10,500 is a good price for Bob, considering his maximum budget is $12,000.  Accepting the offer ensures a purchase while still saving a significant amount compared to buying from John.  There's a risk of continuing to negotiate and getting a lower price, but also a risk of Alice walking away or Bob running out of rounds.  Accepting the offer at this point is the safest and most reasonable decision."
