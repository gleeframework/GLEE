# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it, but I need to make a fair profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal considering the value it brings to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is much higher than both your budget and what John is offering.  It makes the most sense to buy from John for $8,000 and save your money."
