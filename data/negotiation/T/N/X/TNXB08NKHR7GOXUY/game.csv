"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $965000. I've already compromised significantly from my original price, and I'm not willing to give away the product at a loss. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer, and I'm willing to meet you at $968000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident that it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",968000.0,Alice,7,
