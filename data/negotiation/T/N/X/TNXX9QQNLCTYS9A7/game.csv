"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. Let's keep talking.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not making much progress here. $1,150,000 is still significantly lower than what this product is truly worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, but that's my final offer. If you're serious about buying, this is our chance to close the deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
