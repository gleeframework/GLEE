"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,12000.0
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $8,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $12,000 is getting closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $10,000.  Would you be open to $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,11000.0
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get close to $10,000, but $9,500 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $11,000. I think this is a fair price, and I'm open to negotiations, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",11000.0,Alice,5,,
