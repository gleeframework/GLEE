"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $9,000 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  $8,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $7,500.  Would that be possible?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $8,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,200. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great value for the product.",8200.0,Alice,5,
