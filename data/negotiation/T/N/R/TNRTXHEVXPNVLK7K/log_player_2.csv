"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,500 is a better price than John's $15,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  There are still 9 rounds left, providing ample opportunity to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. He knows Alice values the product at $12,000 and is likely willing to make a deal close to that price. Offering $12,500 represents a good starting point for negotiation, leaving room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price and only slightly better than John's offer. There are still 7 rounds remaining. Bob should continue to negotiate to see if he can get a better deal from Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's previous offer of $12,500 was rejected, but Alice is now offering $14,000. This indicates she is willing to compromise. By offering $13,000, Bob is demonstrating a willingness to meet halfway. This counteroffer is still significantly lower than John's offer and could be accepted by Alice, given the need to close a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,800 is getting closer to Bob's desired price, but it's still too high. There are still 5 rounds left in the negotiation, giving Bob time to push for a lower price. By rejecting this offer, Bob can continue to negotiate and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $13,800, showing she's getting closer to Bob's desired price. Bob can now raise his offer slightly to $13,500. This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's latest offer and Bob's previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise. With only 4 rounds left, it's important to move closer to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,900 is only slightly higher than Bob's last counteroffer of $13,500. With only 3 rounds remaining, it's important to consider the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice. While John is a backup option, his price is significantly higher. Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product for a price that is still better than John's, while minimizing the risk of the negotiation collapsing."
