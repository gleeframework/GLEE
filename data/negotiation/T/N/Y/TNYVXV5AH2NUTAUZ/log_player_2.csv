Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get a better price, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $850,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000 and we can get it for $800,000 from John. There's no point in continuing the negotiation.  It's time to cut our losses and secure the product from John."
