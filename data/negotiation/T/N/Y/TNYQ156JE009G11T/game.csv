"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident it will be equally valuable for you. My initial offer is $18,000.  Let me know your thoughts!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is $15,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $15,000 is simply too low for me.  How about $16,500? That would be a fair compromise, and I'd still be able to make a good return on this product. Let me know what you think.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $16,500 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $16,000.  Let's see if we can reach a deal at that price.",16000.0,Bob,4,
