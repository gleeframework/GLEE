Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident it will be equally valuable for you. My initial offer is $18,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 18000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is $15,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $15,000 is simply too low for me.  How about $16,500? That would be a fair compromise, and I'd still be able to make a good return on this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 16500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $16,500 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to go up to $16,000.  Let's see if we can reach a deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $16,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer and allows me to make a decent profit."
