"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is good, but you can likely do better. You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, so there's room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it brings to your business.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price given the value of the product to both of us.  Let's try to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I'm still not willing to go below $875000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I think this is a fair compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $875000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is getting close to your target price of $850,000.  While you could continue negotiating, it's likely that Alice is firm on this price.  Accepting the offer saves you $325,000 compared to buying from John, and you still get the product for a good price.  There's a risk that Alice might reject your counteroffer, and you'd have fewer rounds to negotiate.  It's best to secure the deal now and save the money."
