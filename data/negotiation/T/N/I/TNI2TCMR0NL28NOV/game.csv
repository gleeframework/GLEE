"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I believe the product is worth more than $950,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I can justify right now.  I'm willing to go to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while keeping me within my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
