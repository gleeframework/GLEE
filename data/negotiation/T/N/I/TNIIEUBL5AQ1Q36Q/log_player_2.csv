# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

It's not worth it to accept Alice's offer.  Since you're willing to pay up to $10,000, you have room to negotiate with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $9,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is closer to your target, it's still above your maximum price. You have room to negotiate further and try to get closer to your desired price."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for being flexible.  I'm still hesitant to go above $9,000.  I understand you think it's worth more, but my budget is tight.  Let's split the difference and settle at $9,500.  This is a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $10,200 is still slightly above your maximum price of $10,000. Since you can get the product from John for $10,000, it makes more sense to buy it from him and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
