"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $95. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a decent price, Bob can likely do better.  It's worth exploring counteroffers to potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $85.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $85 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to his $80 valuation. While $90 is better than $95, there's still room for negotiation.  It's worth seeing if Alice will budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $90.  How about we settle on $87.50? That feels like a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
