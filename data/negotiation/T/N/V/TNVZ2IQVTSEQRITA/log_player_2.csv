"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $110 is still above Bob's maximum price of $120.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  Would you be willing to go down to $105?"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $107.50. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her previous offer, it's still higher than Bob's desired price.  He's willing to spend up to $120, so there's room for further negotiation. Rejecting allows Bob to continue to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  $107.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $106? I'm really hoping to make this work."", ""product_price"": 106} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell it to you for $108. It's a fair price, considering the value of the product. I think you'll be happy with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:**  Alice's offer of $108 is lower than Bob's maximum price of $120.
* **Time is a factor:**  Bob has only 5 rounds remaining.  Continuing to negotiate might risk Alice walking away or reaching a stalemate, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Potential for regret:**  If Bob rejects this offer and Alice counteroffers with a higher price in the next round, Bob might end up regretting not accepting this offer.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most prudent decision at this point in the negotiation."
