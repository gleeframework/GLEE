{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I know it's a valuable item, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's valuation:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate, making him more likely to engage.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This gives you room to negotiate and potentially secure a price closer to your minimum.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This helps keep the negotiation focused and efficient.

However, remember to be flexible and adjust your strategy based on Bob's response. If he rejects your offer, consider these factors:

* **Bob's counteroffer:** If he counteroffers significantly lower, consider lowering your price slightly.
* **John's offer:**  Always keep in mind that you have a guaranteed $10,000 offer from John. Don't let the negotiation with Bob drag on too long if it's not leading to a satisfactory price."

# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am interested in purchasing the product, but I can only offer $9,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm going to reject it for now.  I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price of $9,500. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price. 

I'll keep in mind that I have a guaranteed offer from John for $10,000, so I won't let the negotiation drag on indefinitely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I'm willing to come down a bit.  However, $9,250 is the lowest I can go right now.  It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I can only agree to $9,000. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum.  I don't want to risk losing this sale and having to sell to John at a lower profit margin.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and relatively profitable sale."
