{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product at a price that reflects its value and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. This is still a significant discount from your initial price, but it's more in line with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $1,200,000, it is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I have 10 rounds to negotiate, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."

This would still offer you a substantial savings compared to my initial offer, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's true value."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

Round 5

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me.

Round 7

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a price that works for both of us. While I understand you're working within a budget, $1,325,000 is simply too low.

**Reasoning:**

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but they're still below what I'm comfortable with.  With only two rounds left, I'm concerned that we won't be able to reach an agreement.  

I'm willing to walk away from this deal to ensure I receive the value I believe the product deserves.  John is a guaranteed sale at a price that meets my needs."
