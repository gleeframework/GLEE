"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'd be interested in purchasing the product for $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  $12000 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from my ideal price.  I'm willing to come down to $13500.  This would still be a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $13500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $12750?  Let's get this done!",12750.0,Bob,4,
