,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $800,000.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product, but $800,000 is significantly below what it's worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll receive. Let me know if you're open to this.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget in mind. I can do $1,100,000. That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about buying.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,100,000 is still too far off. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway.  Let's try $1,300,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, and shows I'm committed to working with you. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, let's keep moving forward. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a very fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. I think this is a good compromise and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close! I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further. How about $1,175,000?  That's a strong offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1175000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're pushing your budget, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time. Let's go with $1,225,000. This is a fair compromise that respects both our needs. If you're serious about buying this product, I think this is a good final offer. Let me know what you think.",1225000.0,Alice,9,
