Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $20,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 20000
} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Knowing Bob's Value:** While we know Bob values the product at $15,000, he might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives the product as valuable and scarce.
* **Backup Plan (John):** We have a safety net with John, who guarantees us $15,000. This allows us to be bolder in our initial offer to Bob. 

**Important:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters.  Listen to his concerns and be willing to adjust within reason, keeping your $15,000 minimum in mind."
