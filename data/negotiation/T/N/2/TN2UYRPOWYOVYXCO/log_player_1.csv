Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I've done some research and I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product. Can we meet in the middle at $1200000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
