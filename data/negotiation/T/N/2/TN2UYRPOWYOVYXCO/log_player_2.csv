Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the value. While $1200000 is a significant amount, it's unfortunately below the minimum I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to compromise, however, and offer the product for $1700000. This price reflects the product's true potential while still showing flexibility on my end. Let's see if we can find common ground here.
