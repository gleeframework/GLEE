Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This leaves room for negotiation, as Bob values the product at $15,000, but also gives me a good profit margin above my minimum of $8,000. I'm confident that Bob will be willing to negotiate and we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired profit margin. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}

I'm offering $10,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves a profit for me, and is closer to Bob's offer.  I believe this is a fair price that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is close to my desired profit margin and significantly higher than what I would get from John. Accepting this offer is the best option for me at this point."
