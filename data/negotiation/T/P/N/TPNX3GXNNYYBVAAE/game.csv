"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob. However, $650,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we discuss $850,000?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're still in negotiations, Bob. However, $750,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $925,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",925000.0,Alice,5,
