"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to work with you first. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you're willing to pay $15,000 for the product from John, and Alice is offering it for the same price, there's no immediate advantage to accepting her offer. By rejecting, you can see if Alice will lower her price to try and secure the deal. If she doesn't, you can still buy from John."
