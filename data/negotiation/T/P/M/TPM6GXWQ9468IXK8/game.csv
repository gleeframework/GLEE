"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  That would give you a good price, and still allow me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $10,500. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm still looking to save some money.",10250.0,Bob,4,
