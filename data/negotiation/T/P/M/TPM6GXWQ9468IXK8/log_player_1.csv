{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is significantly higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation if needed.  I believe this price is attractive to Bob, given he values it at $15,000, while still securing a good profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired profit margin. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  That would give you a good price, and still allow me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $10,500. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm still looking to save some money. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price point. While I would prefer to sell for more, accepting $10,250 ensures I make a good profit and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
