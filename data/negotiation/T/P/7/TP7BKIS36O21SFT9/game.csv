I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product for a great price! I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18000. What do you think?,18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $18000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $15000?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. I can offer you a compromise at $16500. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $16500 is still a bit above my budget.  Let's try $14000.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I can meet you halfway from $16500 to $14000, so I'll offer you $15500. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",15500.0,Alice,5,
