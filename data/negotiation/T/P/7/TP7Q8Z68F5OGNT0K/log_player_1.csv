This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum, giving you some profit, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

While Bob's offer is above John's offer, I'm going to reject it. There's still room for negotiation and I can likely get closer to my desired price of $115."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to $110, which is still above Bob's offer but shows I'm willing to compromise. This should encourage him to come closer to my desired price."
