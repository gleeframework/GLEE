"Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $115 is a better price than $120, there's still room for negotiation. You can try to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

**Explanation:**

I'm offering Alice $105, which is a fair price considering the product is worth $100 to her. This offer is still within my budget of $120 and leaves room for a potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is a good price for me. It's better than buying from John for $120, and it seems unlikely that I can negotiate much further with Alice. Accepting her offer is the best option at this point."
