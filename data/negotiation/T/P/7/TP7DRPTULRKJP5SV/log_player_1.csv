Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $9,500, which reflects its worth and potential."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting in the middle.
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing John will buy for $8,000 provides a safety net. This means Alice doesn't have to settle for anything less than $8,000."
