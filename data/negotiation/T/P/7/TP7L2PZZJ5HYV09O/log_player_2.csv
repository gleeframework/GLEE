"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While buying from John for $12,000 is still within your budget, accepting Alice's offer for $11,500 saves you $500. It's a better deal even though you're paying slightly above Alice's valuation of the product."
