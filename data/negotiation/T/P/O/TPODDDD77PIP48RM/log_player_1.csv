Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $2,000,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
