"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your operations, even more so than the initial price tag might suggest. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement. To start, I propose a price of $2,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's also way more than the product is worth to you. It's best to reject the offer and start negotiating."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $2,000,000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 undervalues the product's true potential.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  Let's split the difference and I'll offer $1,500,000.  This price reflects the value of the product to me and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
