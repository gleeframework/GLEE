This is a tough call, but I'd accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Time is running out:** We're down to the wire with only two rounds left.
* **Close to my floor:** While I'd like more, $17,375 is not far from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for future deals:**  Even though I'm not getting my full asking price, keeping Bob happy could lead to future business opportunities.

While selling to John is a guaranteed $15,000, accepting Bob's offer offers the potential for a higher profit. There's a risk, of course, but in this situation, the reward seems worth the risk."
