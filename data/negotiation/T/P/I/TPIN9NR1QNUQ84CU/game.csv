"Bob, I have a product that I think would be a great fit for you.  It's valued at $800,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price.  While I have another buyer lined up at $1,200,000, I'm open to negotiation. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
