"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for a price of $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows me to secure a significant return on my investment.  Let me know if you're interested in finalizing the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. You're better off rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John. Even though you'll pay more, you'll still stay within your budget."
