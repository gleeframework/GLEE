"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's start with a price of $1,400,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000, which is a significant step closer to your desired price point. I believe this offer is fair and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a price that's closer to my minimum value. Let's try $1,350,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and my minimum requirements.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $1,350,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000. This offer demonstrates my commitment to a deal, and I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with a price that's too far below my minimum value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,325,000 and $1,350,000, which is $1,337,500. I think this is a fair price that balances our interests. Let's see if we can make a deal.",1337500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,337,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,312,500.  This is a significant compromise for me, and I believe it shows my commitment to reaching a deal.  Let's find a way to make this work for both of us.",1312500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,312,500 is sufficient. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum value. Let's try $1,325,000 again, but this time I'm willing to throw in some additional perks, such as a 2-year warranty and dedicated support. I believe this package is worth considering, and I'm confident we can make a deal.",1325000.0,Alice,7,
