"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, and $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can do $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
