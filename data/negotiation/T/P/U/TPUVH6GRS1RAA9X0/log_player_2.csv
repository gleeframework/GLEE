Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is significantly higher than both her valuation and my maximum budget. I should make a counteroffer significantly lower to try and reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $9,000 is still too high. We're getting closer to a reasonable price, so I'll continue negotiating with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $9,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $7,500 is still too low. How about we split the difference and settle on $8,500? This is a fair price for both of us and we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is getting closer to an acceptable price, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. I'll continue with a counteroffer slightly below Alice's."
