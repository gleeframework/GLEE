"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000? It's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I see where you're coming from, Alice. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product, which is still below its true value but within my budget.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
