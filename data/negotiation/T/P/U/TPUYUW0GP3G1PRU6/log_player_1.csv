"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product for $2,000,000. It's a steal considering its value, and I'm confident it'll be a game-changer for your business.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high offer ($2,000,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Highlight Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to pique his interest. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  I'm inviting Bob to share his thoughts, signaling that I'm open to negotiation.

**Important Note:** This is just a starting point.  My strategy will evolve based on Bob's responses and the progress of the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. I am willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial assessment, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I need to continue negotiating to see if I can secure a better deal. Selling to John right now would guarantee me my minimum, but I believe I can potentially get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000? It's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but framing my counteroffer as a compromise to keep the negotiation amicable. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm suggesting a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Highlighting Benefits:**  I'm reiterating the benefits of the product to reinforce its value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see where you're coming from, Alice. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product, which is still below its true value but within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 meets my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that I'll get a higher offer from Bob.  Accepting his offer ensures a quick and successful deal, securing my minimum desired profit."
