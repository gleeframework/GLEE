We're still significantly above John's offer, and I'm willing to play hardball a bit longer to see if Bob will come up further."

While I could push for a bit more, Bob is clearly willing to pay a premium for the product and we're getting close to the halfway point of the negotiation rounds. Accepting this offer guarantees a significant profit over John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away."
