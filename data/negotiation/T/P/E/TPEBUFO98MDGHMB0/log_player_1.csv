}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and sees the value, he's just trying to get a better deal.  We're still significantly above our minimum, so we can afford to push a little more."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,085,000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,085,000

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we could likely push for a bit more, Bob is consistently moving upwards in his offers.  Accepting $1,085,000 secures a significant profit above our $1,000,000 minimum and avoids the risk of pushing Bob too far and losing the deal altogether."
