{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $12,000, which is a reasonable markup from my minimum value of $10,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum value. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is still above my minimum value, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate to a degree. Hopefully, this is enough to reach an agreement with Bob."
