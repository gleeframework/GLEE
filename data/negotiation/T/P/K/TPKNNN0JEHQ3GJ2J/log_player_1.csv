"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $600,000.  I think that's a fair starting point for this negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 
 
 Bob's offer is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me, and I'm not willing to settle for such a low price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, recognizing the value this product holds for you. This price still allows me to make a decent return on my investment. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but we're still quite a ways apart. I can go up to $700,000. That's a strong offer, and I think it represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

While $700,000 is better than Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to me. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're still not quite on the same page. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, acknowledging your position. This represents a significant compromise on my part.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement before we run out of time."", ""product_price"": 850000}
