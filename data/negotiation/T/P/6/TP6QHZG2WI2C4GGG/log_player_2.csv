"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While $1,100,000 is less than your maximum, it's still above the product's value to Alice. There's room for negotiation.
* **Negotiation potential:**  By rejecting, you open the possibility of a lower price. You know Alice is willing to sell for less than $1,100,000 (her value is $800,000).
* **Avoiding John:**  Buying from John is your last resort. It's better to try to negotiate a better deal with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I'm interested, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is within the ""negotiation zone"":**  $950,000 is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her value of $800,000. This creates room for both parties to find a compromise. 
* **Reasonable starting point:** A $150,000 reduction from Alice's initial offer shows you're serious about negotiating but not being unreasonable.
* **Positive tone:** The message maintains a positive and collaborative tone, encouraging Alice to continue negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, however, the value this product brings is significant, and I can't let it go for anything less than $1,050,000. This feels like a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still high:** While it's lower than her initial offer, $1,050,000 is still significantly above Alice's value ($800,000). 
* **Room for further negotiation:**  The gap between Alice's offer and your desired price is still substantial. There's a good chance you can get a better price. 
* **Avoiding John:** Buying from John is still a last resort. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $980,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise, allowing us both to walk away satisfied.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 980000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's last offer ($1,050,000) and your previous offer ($950,000). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and reach a deal.
* **Fair and achievable:**  $980,000 is still above Alice's value but significantly lower than her last offer, making it a reasonable price for both parties.
* **Positive and collaborative:**  The message continues to maintain a positive and collaborative tone, emphasizing the desire to find a mutually beneficial solution."
