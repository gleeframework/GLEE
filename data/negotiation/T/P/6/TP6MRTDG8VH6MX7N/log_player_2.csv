"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe will be valuable for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000, which is a great deal considering its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high.  We have plenty of room to negotiate downwards and should aim to get closer to our $8,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $5,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."",
 ""product_price"": 5000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

We start with a low counteroffer to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. This offer is significantly lower than her asking price, but still leaves room for us to increase our bid in later rounds. By anchoring a low price early, we aim to influence the direction of the negotiation in our favor."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is significantly lower than what I'm able to accept.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down significantly in price, but we're still slightly above our ideal price from John. By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're serious about a lower price without completely stalling the negotiation. There's a chance Alice will be willing to go even lower, closer to our $8,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. Would $6,750 work for you?"",
 ""product_price"": 6750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Willingness to Negotiate:** By proposing a price exactly halfway, we demonstrate a willingness to compromise and find a mutually agreeable solution. 
* **Maintain Upward Trajectory:** This counteroffer is significantly higher than our initial lowball offer, showing Alice that we're willing to move closer to her price.
* **Still Below Budget:**  Importantly, this price keeps us well below our $8,000 maximum and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $6,750 is closer, but it's still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to come down to $7,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it allows us both to get a decent deal.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $7,500 is getting closer to John's price, we still have some room to negotiate. There are a few rounds left, and it's worth seeing if Alice is willing to go even lower, closer to our target price. We're in a strong position since we have the backup option of John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we settle at $7,000? That seems like a fair compromise to me."",
 ""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We are offering a smaller concession this round ($500) compared to our previous concession ($750), signaling to Alice that we are approaching our limit. 
* **Near Target Price:** $7,000 is a strong offer, putting us just $1,000 away from John's price and potentially saving us a significant amount.
* **Maintain Positive Tone:** We want to keep the negotiation amicable and cooperative, encouraging Alice to continue working towards a deal."
