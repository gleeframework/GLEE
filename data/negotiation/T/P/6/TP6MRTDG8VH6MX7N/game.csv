"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe will be valuable for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000, which is a great deal considering its worth. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $5,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is significantly lower than what I'm able to accept.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. Would $6,750 work for you?",6750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $6,750 is closer, but it's still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to come down to $7,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it allows us both to get a decent deal.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",7500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we settle at $7,000? That seems like a fair compromise to me.",7000.0,Bob,6,
