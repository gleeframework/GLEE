"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe will be valuable for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000, which is a great deal considering its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This is a starting point that's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.  It's also significantly less than my minimum value, allowing for potential profit. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the product's value for Bob. It also positions the offer as a ""great deal"" to encourage acceptance. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a quick win by offering a price that's attractive to Bob, while still ensuring I'm not selling below my minimum. If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer.  I'll keep John's $15,000 offer in mind as a fallback option if negotiations with Bob don't reach a suitable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $5,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $5,000 is far too low for me.  It's well below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. While I want to make a deal with Bob, I'm not willing to settle for such a huge loss. 

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I will make a counteroffer that's more in line with my value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'll continue to keep John's offer in mind as a potential way to secure my minimum value if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is significantly lower than what I'm able to accept.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$8,500:**  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Message:** The message is still friendly and focuses on finding common ground. I'm acknowledging his offer, but also emphasizing the product's value to him.  The ""split the difference"" approach can be persuasive.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to find a compromise that's more appealing to Bob while still protecting my interests. If he rejects this offer, I'll continue to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffers, always keeping John's $15,000 offer in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. Would $6,750 work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $6,750 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. I'm not willing to accept such a huge loss, even though we're making progress in the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. I believe there's still room for compromise, and I'll make a counteroffer that's more in line with my value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'll continue to keep John's offer in mind as a potential way to secure my minimum value if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $6,750 is closer, but it's still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to come down to $7,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it allows us both to get a decent deal.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$7,500:** This offer is a smaller compromise from my previous offer, demonstrating that I'm still willing to negotiate but also maintaining my position. It's still above Bob's offer, but closer to a potential agreement.
* **Message:** The message is positive and focuses on collaboration and finding a solution that benefits both parties. It acknowledges Bob's efforts, while reiterating the value of the product for him.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to inch closer to a mutually acceptable price while staying above my minimum acceptable value.  I'm also emphasizing the collaborative nature of the negotiation to encourage Bob to continue.  However, I'm aware that time is running out, and I'll need to assess whether further negotiation is worthwhile or if I should consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we settle at $7,000? That seems like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $7,000 is still below my ideal price, it's a significant improvement from his previous offers. With only 4 rounds remaining, it's getting increasingly risky to keep rejecting and hoping for a better deal.  Considering John's offer of $15,000, accepting $7,000 would still be a considerable profit for me, and a much better outcome than risking a breakdown in negotiations.

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to prioritize a guaranteed profit over potentially getting a slightly higher price. Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a sale and avoid the risk of running out of time and having to accept John's offer (which would require me to forgo my initial goal of selling to Bob).  I'm balancing my desire for the best possible price with the need to make a practical decision in a time-sensitive situation."
