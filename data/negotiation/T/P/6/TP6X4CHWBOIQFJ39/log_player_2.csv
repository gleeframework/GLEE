Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $11,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $11,500 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's make this happen!

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $13,000 is still above my budget of $12,000. I can still try to negotiate a lower price, as there are still rounds available."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $12,500.  I hope we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a slight increase from my previous offer, showing Alice I'm willing to be flexible. It also positions me closer to my maximum budget, leaving room for a potential final compromise."
