Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $800,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
