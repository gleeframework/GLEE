"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering purchasing our product. We're excited to work with you. After careful consideration, we're willing to offer you the product for $900,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still above my maximum budget.  I'll try to negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $800,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After re-evaluating the product's value, we're willing to meet you halfway. We're willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is our best offer, and we believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to your business. Let us know if this is something you'd like to move forward with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is within my budget and represents a significant discount from her initial offer. While I'd like to get it even lower, I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product within my budget and allows me to avoid further negotiation."
