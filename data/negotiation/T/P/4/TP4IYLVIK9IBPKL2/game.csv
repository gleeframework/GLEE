,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to make this deal work. This still gives you a significant savings over its true value to you. Let's find a middle ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $8,500. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",8500.0,Bob,4,
