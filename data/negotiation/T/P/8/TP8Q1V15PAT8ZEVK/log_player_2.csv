"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $1,200,000 is still above your maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm very interested in your product, and I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is my best offer, let me know if it works for you."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** We're starting with a significant discount from Alice's offer, but still above our ideal price. 
* **Justification:** We provide a reason for the counteroffer (budget constraint) and express continued interest.
* **Open to Negotiation:** We leave the door open for further discussion by saying this is our ""best offer"" rather than a strict ultimatum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my expectations, but I'm willing to compromise. After reevaluating the product's value, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is my best counteroffer so far, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While $1,100,000 is a lower price than Alice's initial offer, it's still significantly higher than your budget. It's worth seeing if you can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still above my maximum budget.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price considering my budget limitations and the value of the product to me. Would you be willing to consider it?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're raising our offer incrementally, showing a willingness to negotiate without going too far over budget.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is getting closer to my target, but I'm still not willing to let it go for that price. After reevaluating the product's value, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is my best counteroffer yet, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is closer to my target, I'm still a bit stretched. I'm willing to offer you $975,000 for the product. This is a significant move for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this deal. Let's try to find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  We're raising our offer again, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. The increase is smaller this time, suggesting we're getting closer to our limit.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my target. However, I'm still not willing to let the product go for $975,000. After reevaluating the product's value, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Limit:**  Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is very close to your maximum budget.
* **Limited Room for Negotiation:**  Alice has declared this her ""final counteroffer"", indicating limited room for further negotiation.
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Continuing to negotiate might result in a stalemate, wasting valuable time. 
* **Safe Alternative:**  Buying from John for $800,000 guarantees you the product within your budget and avoids further negotiation risks.

While a slightly lower price from Alice might be ideal, it's not worth risking the deal or potentially going over budget. Buying from John is the safest and most efficient option at this point."
