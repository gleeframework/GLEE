"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm very interested in your product, and I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is my best offer, let me know if it works for you.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is closer to my target, I'm still a bit stretched. I'm willing to offer you $975,000 for the product. This is a significant move for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this deal. Let's try to find a way to make this work.",975000.0,Bob,6,
