Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping to get closer to the value I have in mind. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,075,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and it's a compromise from my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is still higher than what you're willing to pay. At this point, it's better to buy from John for $1,000,000 and avoid further negotiation."
