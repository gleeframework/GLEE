"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $9,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this sale worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair compromise, and it gives you a good deal while still allowing me to cover my costs. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $11,000, so I'm thinking $9,500. Can we meet in the middle?",9500.0,Bob,4,
