Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  He's willing to pay $8,000, so $12,000 gives him room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than my minimum:** It's still above my minimum of $15,000, giving me space to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **It shows good faith:** It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great!
* If he rejects, we'll analyze his counteroffer and proceed based on his offer.
* If the negotiation drags on, or if his offers are too low, I can always walk away and sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While it's tempting to take the deal for some profit, it's not worth sacrificing a large portion of my potential earnings.  

I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. This will give me the opportunity to push for a higher price and see if we can find a more mutually agreeable solution."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $9,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this sale worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair compromise, and it gives you a good deal while still allowing me to cover my costs. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This offer is a compromise, as it's halfway between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. 
* **Staying above my minimum:** $11,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on fairness:**  The message highlights the fairness of the offer, emphasizing that it's a good deal for both of us. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great!
* If he rejects, I'll have to carefully consider his next counteroffer.
* If we can't reach an agreement, I can always sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $11,000, so I'm thinking $9,500. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is coming closer to my desired price, his offer of $9,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Continuing to negotiate with him risks losing time and potentially settling for a price that is too low.

Considering that I have a guaranteed sale to John for $15,000, it's more beneficial to stop the negotiation with Bob and sell to John. This ensures I get the best possible price and avoid further potential losses."
