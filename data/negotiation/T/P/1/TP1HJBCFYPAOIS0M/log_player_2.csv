Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. While we understand your budget constraints, we're unable to match the proposed price of $700,000. However, I'd like to extend an alternative offer of $800,000. This still represents a significant discount from the original price, while allowing us to maintain a reasonable margin. I hope this proposal is more in line with what you're looking for.

# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I'm glad we're able to find common ground. In light of your proposal, I'd like to extend an offer of $775,000. This price reflects a fair compromise between our initial positions, allowing you to secure the product within your budget while still providing us with a reasonable profit. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations.

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate but is unlikely to go much lower than $775,000. Accepting this offer secures a significant discount from both her original price and John's offer."
