{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $115 is higher than Bob's valuation of $100, giving him a bit of room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $115 is below your minimum of $120, leaving you some room to go lower if necessary. 

By starting with this offer, I can gauge Bob's interest and potentially find a price that works for both of us. If Bob rejects the offer, I can adjust it based on his counteroffer or choose to sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $105 is closer to my minimum than Bob's initial valuation, I believe I can still secure a better price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can demonstrate that I'm not desperate for a sale. It also allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $105. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $108 is still less than my desired price, it's getting closer to my minimum and it's clear Bob isn't willing to go higher.  Accepting his offer will result in a quicker sale and a decent profit.  It's better than potentially going back and forth for more rounds and ultimately having to sell to John for $120."
