"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your product, but $95 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85, which is still a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider a middle ground. For this reason, I propose we set the product price at $90. This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit while being fair to you.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $90 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $87.50?  This would be a good deal for both of us.",87.5,Bob,4,
