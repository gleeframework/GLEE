"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount considering its value to me, and I believe it's a fair price given its potential worth to you. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you place on it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still leaves some room for profit for me, and it's significantly less than what I could get from another buyer.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering your potential profit and the value of the product to me.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000, but this is my final offer.  I need to ensure I receive a fair price for this valuable product. Let's close this deal, as I don't want to risk losing it to another buyer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
