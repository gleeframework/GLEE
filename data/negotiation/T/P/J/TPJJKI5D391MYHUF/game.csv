"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $120. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $120? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $120 is just too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about $130? This price still gives you a great deal on a valuable product, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand that $130 might not be ideal for you, but I'm also looking to stay within my budget. Could we possibly agree on $125? This would be the highest I could go while still ensuring I stay within my financial limits. Thank you for considering my request.",125.0,Bob,4,
