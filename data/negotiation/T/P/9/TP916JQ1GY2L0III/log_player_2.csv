"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not quite ready to accept $60. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. How about we try $90? It's still a good compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving closer to my price range,  $90 is still more than John's offer of $80. I'm better off taking the guaranteed deal from John at this point."
