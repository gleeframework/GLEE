"Alice, your initial offer is quite high. While I see the value in this product, my budget is considerably lower. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This is a serious offer and represents the maximum I can afford at this time. ",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This is my final offer for today, as I have other interested buyers.  Let me know your decision.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This is a serious offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at this price. ",1200000.0,Bob,4,
