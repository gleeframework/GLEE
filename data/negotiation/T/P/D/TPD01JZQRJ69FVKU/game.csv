"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident you'll find this a worthwhile investment.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle at $14,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $17,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $13,500. Can we meet in the middle at that price?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $13,500 is still quite a ways off from what I need.  I could be persuaded to part with it for $16,000.  This is my final offer.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $16,000 is still a bit too rich for my blood. I'm willing to meet you at $14,500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that?",14500.0,Bob,6,
