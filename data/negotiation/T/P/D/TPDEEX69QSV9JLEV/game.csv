"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $5,000 for it.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your position, $5,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $18,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. Would you consider $6,500? That's a fair offer, reflecting my strong interest while acknowledging the need for a realistic price point.",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I can go down to $15,000, considering it's a steal for the value you're getting.",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value is $15,000 to you, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Could we agree on $7,000? That's a significant amount and shows I'm serious about buying.",7000.0,Bob,6,
