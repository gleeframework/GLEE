Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. I'm confident you'll find this to be a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $5,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your position, $5,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $18,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. Would you consider $6,500? That's a fair offer, reflecting my strong interest while acknowledging the need for a realistic price point.

You have three options:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I can go down to $15,000, considering it's a steal for the value you're getting."", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value is $15,000 to you, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Could we agree on $7,000? That's a significant amount and shows I'm serious about buying. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

Bob is not showing a willingness to reach a price that reflects the product's value to me. He's consistently lowballing, and it's unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer in the remaining rounds.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
