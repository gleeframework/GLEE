Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,150,000** is a price that is higher than what I could get from John, ensuring a better profit for me. 
* It's also a price that is lower than what the product is worth to Bob, giving him a potential gain if he accepts. 
* This strategy attempts to balance maximizing my profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider."
