Round 6
Bob's offer:

At this point, Bob has demonstrated that he is highly unlikely to meet my minimum acceptable price.  It's clear that further negotiation with him is not going to bridge the gap. Selling to John guarantees I receive the full value of the product and avoids the risk of further concessions with Bob."
