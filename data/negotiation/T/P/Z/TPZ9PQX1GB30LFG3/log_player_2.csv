"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is the maximum I'm willing to pay, there's no reason to accept the first offer. There's a chance I can get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 12.5% discount. This should give Alice some room to negotiate while still leaving me with a decent margin."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than my maximum budget. I will reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There's still a chance she might come down, and I don't want to rush into buying from John at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $7,500. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a compromise between my initial offer and her last one."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now higher than my maximum budget of $8,000.  It's clear that we're not going to agree on a price, and further negotiation is unlikely to get her lower.  Therefore, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John for my maximum budget of $8,000."
