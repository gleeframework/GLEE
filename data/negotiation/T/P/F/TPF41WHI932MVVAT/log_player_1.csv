"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($120) but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives Bob room to negotiate and creates a sense of urgency.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly and positive tone encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Room for Compromise:** The initial offer leaves room for compromise in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Improvement:** Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price ($150), but I still have room to increase the price.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better deal.
* **Value to John:** While John is willing to pay $150, I want to see if I can get closer to that price through negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product, reminding Bob of the potential benefit of acquiring it.
* **Urgency:** The ""Let's make this happen!"" statement subtly adds a sense of urgency.  
* **Strategic Price:** $135 is a good middle ground that allows for potential further negotiation while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $130 again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** Bob's offer is the same as his previous offer.  This suggests he might be willing to go slightly higher if I hold firm. 
* **Time is on my side:** I have several rounds remaining, and selling to John is always an option. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm not desperate and am willing to continue the negotiation, potentially leading to a better price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I value your interest in the product. I'm willing to go down to $133. It's a great price, and I'm confident you won't regret it.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 133}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:** I'm making a small concession, showing flexibility while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin. 
* **Urgency:** The ""Let's close this deal!"" statement adds a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to accept the offer.
* **Value Reiteration:** I remind Bob that the product is worth it and the price is fair. 
* **Strategic Price:** $133 is a good middle ground that could potentially be the final price, given Bob's budget constraints. It's still above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still a bit short. Would you be willing to meet me at $129? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $129. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $129
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150. However, I still have several rounds left and John is a guaranteed sale at a higher price.
* **Negotiation Advantage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can potentially push him closer to my desired price in the remaining rounds.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While accepting Bob's offer would be quick, the potential for a higher price with John outweighs the risk of continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to make one final concession and offer the product for $131.  This is a very fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this deal. Let's finalize this."", ""product_price"": 131}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:** This is my final attempt to reach an agreement with Bob. I'm lowering the price slightly from my previous offer, showing my commitment to finding a solution. 
* **Urgency:** The ""final concession"" and ""finalize this"" phrasing create a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to accept. 
* **Reasonable Price:** $131 is a reasonable price that still gives me a decent profit, while likely being within Bob's budget range.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive tone throughout the negotiation keeps the conversation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short. Would you be willing to meet me at $128? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:** Bob's offer is getting dangerously close to my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time Pressure:**  We are down to the final few rounds, and there's no guarantee Bob will accept a higher price.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees a profit of $150, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer.  The risk of continuing the negotiation is not worth the potential loss of a guaranteed higher price.
* **Future Opportunities:** I can always try to sell the product to Bob again at a later date, if the opportunity arises."
