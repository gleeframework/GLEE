Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  Alice is selling the product for $1,100,000, while John is selling it for $1,200,000. 
* **You can save money by accepting Alice's offer.** Even though Alice's offer is slightly above your perceived value of $1,000,000, it's still a better deal than buying from John."
