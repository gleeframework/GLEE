Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $850,000?"", ""product_price"": 850000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $850,000 is tempting, it doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,000,000. This still provides you with a substantial value and allows me to achieve my goals. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we settle on $950,000? This price acknowledges the value of the product for you and allows me to make a good profit. Let's finalize this deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

At $950,000, Alice's offer is a good compromise. You're saving a significant amount compared to John's price and Alice is likely close to her lowest acceptable price. Pushing further might make her less willing to negotiate."
