"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $850,000 is tempting, it doesn't quite meet my needs. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,000,000. This still provides you with a substantial value and allows me to achieve my goals. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. $1,000,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you be open to $925,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we settle on $950,000? This price acknowledges the value of the product for you and allows me to make a good profit. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",950000.0,Alice,5,
