"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $900,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth $800,000 to me, and Bob's offer of $750,000 is less than that. While I could sell to John for $800,000, there's still room for negotiation with Bob, and I want to maximize my profit. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This gives you a good deal, and it's still within my acceptable range.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $850,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay.  I'm willing to go to $800,000, which is my absolute limit.  If you're open to that, we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and it aligns with John's offer. I'd rather sell to Bob since he is the original buyer, and there's no further room for negotiation."
