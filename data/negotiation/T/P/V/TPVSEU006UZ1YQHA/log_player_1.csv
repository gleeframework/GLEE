This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum of $800,000, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to haggle. It also highlights the value the product holds for him, increasing the chances of him accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think it's a bit high at $1,000,000, but I'm interested in making a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter his offer and see if we can meet in the middle."
