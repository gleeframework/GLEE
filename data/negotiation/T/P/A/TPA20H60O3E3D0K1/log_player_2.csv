"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at $1,250,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is a fair price, and it allows us both to walk away with a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now within Bob's budget:** $1,150,000 is less than Bob's maximum of $1,500,000.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield much:** Alice has already lowered her price significantly. 
* **Buying from John is more expensive:** John's price is $1,500,000, making Alice's offer the better deal."
