"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I have another buyer who's prepared to pay $1,000,000 for this product right now. I value our conversation and believe we can still make a deal, but it needs to be closer to that figure. I'm willing to accept $1,025,000. This is my final offer.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand the position you're in, and I respect that. However, $1,025,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I can offer a final price of $975,000. This is a fair offer, considering the market value and my own budget. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",975000.0,Bob,6,
