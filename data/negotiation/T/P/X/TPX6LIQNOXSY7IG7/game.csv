"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the market value is around $1,500,000 to you. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a great starting point. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the market value and the value it will bring to your business. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $825,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I think a price of $725,000 would be a fair compromise. It reflects the value I see in the product while acknowledging your need for a reasonable return. What do you say?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire for a compromise, but $725,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a good return on my investment. I'm offering the product to you for $775,000. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,5,
