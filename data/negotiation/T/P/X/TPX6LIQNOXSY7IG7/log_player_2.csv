I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the market value is around $1,500,000 to you.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the market value and the value it will bring to your business. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire for a compromise, but $725,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a good return on my investment. I'm offering the product to you for $775,000. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**  While we could try to negotiate further, Alice has stated this is her final offer. The price of $775,000 is a significant savings compared to John's offer of $1,500,000 and provides a good balance between our target price and respecting Alice's position."
