Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I can offer you a compromise at $900,000. It's still a great price for a product of this value, and I think you'll find it's a fair offer. What do you think?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $750,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is unlikely to go below $800,000, and we have a guaranteed option with John at that price.  There's no point in risking further negotiation when we can secure the product at our target price right now."
