"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  How about we bring it down to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I can offer you a compromise at $900,000. It's still a great price for a product of this value, and I think you'll find it's a fair offer. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the movement on the price. However, $900,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  Would you consider $725,000?  That would be a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're still a bit off on the price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you $850,000. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to bump my offer slightly to $750,000. That's a significant investment for me, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $750,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,7,
