"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you.  Given its value, I'm offering it at $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  The product looks great, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $110?"",
 ""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to leave room for negotiation. This also helps us gauge how flexible Alice might be on price. 
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  The message is polite and acknowledges the product's value while expressing our budgetary limitations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, but $110 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While $125 is closer to a reasonable price, we're aiming to get as close to $110 as possible. We have rounds to spare and can try to nudge Alice down further. 
* **Alternative Exists:** We always have the option of buying from John for $150 if negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you moving towards a compromise, Alice.  How about we settle at $115?  That's a fair price for both of us."",
 ""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** We're suggesting a price almost directly in the middle of the previous two offers ($110 and $125). This shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a lower price.
* **Direct and Clear:**  We're clearly stating the price and suggesting it as a fair compromise."
