"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. That's a fair price considering your value for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer and still allows me to get closer to my desired value.  Let's see if we can reach a deal at this price.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your perspective, but $875,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $890,000, which is a compromise from my last offer.  This price is fair considering the value of the product to you and allows me to meet my minimum requirements. Let's close this deal at this price.",890000.0,Alice,5,
