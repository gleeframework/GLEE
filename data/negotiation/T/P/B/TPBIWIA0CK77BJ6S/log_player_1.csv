Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $1000000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $750000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.

Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position.  While $900000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget.  Let's try $800000.  I'm confident this product is valuable, but I need to stay within a reasonable price range.
