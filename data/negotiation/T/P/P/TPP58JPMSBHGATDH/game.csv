"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $100.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  How about $85?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $92.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $90. I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to compromise again. How about we meet at $91? It's still a good price for the product, and I'm willing to give you a slight discount to keep the deal moving forward.",91.0,Alice,5,
