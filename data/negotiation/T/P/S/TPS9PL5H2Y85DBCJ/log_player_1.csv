Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This gives me a good margin above my minimum value, while hopefully still being attractive enough to Bob. I'll be prepared to negotiate, but want to see what his reaction is to this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. While I want to maximize profit, selling to John at $1,200,000 is a guaranteed sale.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,300,000. This is still above my minimum value and hopefully a more reasonable compromise for Bob. I'm hoping to find a price that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm also aware that John is a guaranteed buyer for $1,200,000.  To avoid further haggling, I'll choose to sell to John and secure the sale."
