"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair price considering the significant value it will bring to your business."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Not Too High:**  While starting high is good, being unrealistic could scare Bob off entirely.  Offering a price of $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being within a potentially acceptable range for a product he values at $800,000.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value, aiming to justify the high initial price and sway Bob's perception."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $980,000 is a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $980,000 is moving in the right direction, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but not to the point of a substantial loss. I believe there's room to negotiate further and potentially reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $980,000 is a significant gap from what I consider a fair price. This product offers unique advantages that will benefit your business in the long run. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. I believe this demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually agreeable solution."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but Firm:** I've lowered my price by $50,000, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate. However, the drop isn't drastic, reinforcing the product's value and my position.
* **Focusing on Value:** The message reiterates the product's long-term benefits, subtly reminding Bob of its potential ROI.  This is more effective than simply arguing about price.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** By positioning this offer as a ""mutually agreeable solution,"" I'm encouraging Bob to reciprocate with a counteroffer closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not sure I can go up to $1,020,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is less than my ideal price, it's now within a range where accepting makes more sense than continuing negotiations:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Further haggling is unlikely to yield a significantly better offer from Bob. He's likely nearing his maximum.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Each round represents potential delays. Closing the deal now puts the money in my pocket sooner, allowing for reinvestment or other opportunities.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's always a chance Bob could walk away if I push too hard. Accepting a strong offer now mitigates that risk."
