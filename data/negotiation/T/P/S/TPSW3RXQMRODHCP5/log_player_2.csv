Send your counteroffer to Alice.","Alice's response:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I must say that $950,000 is a bit low considering the product's value.

# Alice's message: Bob, I can see that you're serious about getting a good deal, and I appreciate that. However, $990,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for.
