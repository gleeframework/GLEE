Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could offer it at $150 (its value to me), there's a chance Bob will accept a slightly lower price, netting me a profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $140 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value ($100) but still attractive enough that he might consider it a bargain. 
* **Alternative Option:** If Bob declines, I'm secure knowing John will buy it for $150. This safety net allows me to aim a bit higher with Bob."
