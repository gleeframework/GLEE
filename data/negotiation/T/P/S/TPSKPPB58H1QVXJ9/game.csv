"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not comfortable with the price you suggested. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll propose a price of $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm confident it's still a fair price for this exceptional product.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price you've suggested. I'll make one more concession and propose a price of $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I believe it's still a fair price for this exceptional product.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  To be honest, my budget limit is $750,000. If you can meet that, we have a deal. Otherwise, I need to respect my budget and walk away. ",750000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stick to your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $825,000, as I mentioned earlier. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your budget, so I'll propose a price of $787,500. This is my final concession, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",787500.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to raise your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'll make one last attempt to meet you in the middle. I'll propose a price of $780,000. This is my absolute final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",780000.0,Alice,9,
