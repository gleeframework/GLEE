Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation.  I'm confident I can secure a higher offer, especially since I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a better price.  I know John is willing to pay $1,000,000, so I have a safety net and I'm going to try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting, I'm not comfortable dropping to $975,000.  I know I can get $1,000,000 from John, and I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Bob to try and get closer to that price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I was hoping to get a bit more from Bob, we're getting close to the end of the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  John is a sure thing at $1,000,000, and that's a good price for me."
