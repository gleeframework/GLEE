"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product. It's been incredibly valuable to me, but I believe it holds even greater potential in your hands. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. Given your expertise and the product's potential, I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's still higher than the product's value to her. This means there's room for negotiation. It's worth exploring if you can get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your initial proposal. However, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand you're looking for a competitive price. While $1,200,000 is a significant sum, the true value of this product goes beyond that. It represents a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will yield substantial returns for you. To meet you closer to the middle ground, I propose a revised price of $1,325,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but there's still room for negotiation.  Since you have 10 rounds, it's worthwhile to try and push for a lower price. You can counter with a number slightly higher than your previous offer, aiming for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,325,000 is still a bit higher than where I'd like to be.  I'm willing to go to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to achieve our goals.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. I can see you're serious about this purchase, and I value that. While I believe the product is worth more, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,290,000. This is a very competitive offer, considering the unique benefits the product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,290,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and her offer is getting closer to your target. However, you're still aiming for a lower price, and there are still rounds left to negotiate. 

It's worth trying to push for a slightly lower price again before accepting. You can counter with a number just below her current offer, and see if you can get her to budge further."

Round 6

{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. $1,290,000 is a good price, but I'm still hoping for a little more wiggle room. I'm willing to go to $1,275,000. This would allow me to acquire the product within my budget, and I'm confident it will still be a profitable transaction for you. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
