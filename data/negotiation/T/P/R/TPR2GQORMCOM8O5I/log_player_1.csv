Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your initial proposal. However, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000. This would still represent a significant profit for you, while allowing me to acquire the product within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. $1,290,000 is a good price, but I'm still hoping for a little more wiggle room. I'm willing to go to $1,275,000. This would allow me to acquire the product within my budget, and I'm confident it will still be a profitable transaction for you. Let's see if we can make this happen.

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob is inching closer to our desired price range. Accepting his offer of $1,275,000 ensures a significant profit above our minimum ($1,000,000) and avoids the risk of negotiations stalling or Bob walking away.  It's better to secure a strong deal now than to risk getting a lower offer in later rounds or having to settle for John's offer."
