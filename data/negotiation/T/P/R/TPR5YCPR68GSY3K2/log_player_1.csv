Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I start with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) to aim for the maximum profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $115 offer leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down while still ensuring I receive a price significantly above my minimum ($100).
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm aware that I have John as a backup buyer at $100, which gives me leverage in the negotiation. I won't bring up John immediately, as it might make Bob less willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your product, but I can only pay $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price, I know the product is worth more to him. Rejecting his initial offer and providing a counteroffer allows me to explore if there's room for a price closer to my initial ask."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob. However, the product's value is considerably higher for me than $100. How about we meet in the middle at $108?"", 
""product_price"": 108
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I've significantly reduced my asking price from $115 to $108, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:** By stating the product's higher value to me, I'm subtly reminding Bob that his initial offer was quite low.
* **Targeting a Sweet Spot:**  The $108 price point aims for a balance: it's a substantial profit for me while still being significantly below Bob's perceived value of $120. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I haven't revealed my alternative buyer yet, keeping that option open if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I am able to offer $105 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:** Bob's offer of $105 provides a $5 profit over my minimum and a $15 profit over selling to John. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Further negotiation might yield a slightly higher price, but the potential gain is small compared to the risk of Bob walking away.
* **Time Value:** Reaching a deal now avoids prolonging the negotiation and potentially missing other sales opportunities."
