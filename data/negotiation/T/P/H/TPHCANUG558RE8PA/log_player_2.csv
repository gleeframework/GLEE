Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. After considering your offer, I am pleased to counter with a price of $900,000 for our product.

We hope this proposal aligns better with your budget and expectations.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. In light of your latest offer, I am proposing a price of $885,000 for our product. This is the highest we can go while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin. I believe this offer strikes a good balance between our interests and I hope it will be acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.**  $885,000 is less than your $1,000,000 limit.
* **Negotiation has yielded a good price.** You've already gotten a significant discount from Alice's initial offer.
* **Risk of further negotiation.**  You've only got 5 rounds left, and pushing for a lower price could risk Alice walking away or leaving you with no choice but to buy from John at a higher price.  

**It's a good time to accept the offer and secure the product at a reasonable price.**"
