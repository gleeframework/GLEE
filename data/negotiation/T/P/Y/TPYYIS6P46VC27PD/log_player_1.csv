Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering your valuation. Let me know if you're open to that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
