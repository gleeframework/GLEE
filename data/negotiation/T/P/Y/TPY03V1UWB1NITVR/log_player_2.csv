"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.  This is a significant discount and a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I will reject Alice's offer since the product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and buying it from Alice would cost me $400,000 more than buying it from John.
