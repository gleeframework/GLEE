Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 149}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:**  While you'd accept $150 from John, aiming slightly lower with Bob might secure a sale without a significant loss.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  Starting high leaves room for Bob to counter-offer. Even if he negotiates down, you're still likely to get a price above his perceived value of $80 and closer to your minimum of $150. 
* **Appear reasonable:**  A price slightly below your guaranteed sale price might make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal, increasing the chance of acceptance."
