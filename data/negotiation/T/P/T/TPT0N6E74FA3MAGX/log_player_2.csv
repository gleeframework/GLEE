"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way too high. While the product is worth $800,000 to you, Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly above your target. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for the product.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,100,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered the price, $1,100,000 is still quite high compared to my target of $800,000. I'm not willing to go that high, so I'll reject the offer and counter again, aiming to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still too much for me. Let's keep working towards a middle ground.

Round 5

# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000.

Alice's offer is still higher than my desired price of $800,000. However, we are getting closer. I'll reject the offer and counter again, aiming to reach a compromise. It's better to continue negotiating than to buy from John at this point, as I could potentially get a better deal with Alice."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. While $1,050,000 is still a bit above my target, I'm willing to go up to $975,000 for the product.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into our negotiation so far. I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to $1,025,000, it's still above my target of $800,000. We're getting closer, and it's worth pushing for a lower price. I'll reject the offer and counter again. It's possible that Alice is getting closer to her minimum price, but it's also possible that she still has room to negotiate. I'm not ready to buy from John yet, as I think I can get a better deal with Alice."

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into our negotiation so far. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is $1,050,000.  This is still above my desired price of $800,000. While we've made progress in negotiations, it's not enough to justify going over my budget. With only one round remaining, I'm not confident that I can negotiate a lower price.  Therefore, I will buy the product from John for $800,000. This will ensure that I get the product within my budget and avoid risking further negotiation that might not be successful."
