I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a high starting point, but it leaves room for negotiation. I believe it's important to start strong to get the best possible price. I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,000,000 to me, and I'm hoping Bob will see its value as well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $1,200,000 is better than my minimum, I believe the product is worth more. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob with a price of $1,400,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but I'm still confident the product's value justifies this price.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,250,000 is a decent amount and significantly higher than selling to John.  It's time to close the deal and move on."
