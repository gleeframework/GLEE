(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is your maximum budget, so it's a good starting point for negotiation. Hopefully, Alice will recognize that you're serious about buying and may be willing to negotiate closer to your price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to your budget, it's still over what you're comfortable paying. Alice seems willing to negotiate, so it's worth another counteroffer to try and reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, offering Alice a price that is closer to her last offer but still within your acceptable range. This demonstrates a willingness to meet her halfway, while also keeping the price below your maximum budget. It increases the chance of a successful negotiation and avoids the need to purchase from John at your maximum price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is getting closer to your budget, it's still not ideal. Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and you're still in a position to potentially get a better deal. You can make another counteroffer to test the waters further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

You've already shown a willingness to compromise, and Alice has made concessions as well. This counteroffer offers a price that is just slightly higher than your previous one, suggesting that you're serious about acquiring the product while still pushing for a more favorable price. It also keeps the offer within your budget and leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice's offer is only slightly better than your previous counteroffer.  It's clear that we're not going to get much closer to your ideal price.  While it might be tempting to continue negotiating, you've already rejected multiple offers and made multiple counteroffers.  The process is starting to drag on, and you risk wasting more time without guarantee of a significantly better price. 

It's best to go ahead and purchase from John at your maximum budget. You're guaranteed a deal within your price range, and you can avoid further negotiation and potential delays."
