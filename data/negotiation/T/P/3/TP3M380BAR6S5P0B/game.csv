"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and gives me a good profit. Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to invest. However, $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $1,050,000? That's still a great deal for you, given your estimated value, and it's a reasonable compromise for me.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,050,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
