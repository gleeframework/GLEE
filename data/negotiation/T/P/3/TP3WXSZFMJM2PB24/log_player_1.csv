I'm starting with an offer of $100. This gives me a decent margin while still being a potentially attractive price for Bob.  I'll see if he's willing to bite!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

Bob's offer of $95 is  better than selling to John for $80. I'll take it!"
