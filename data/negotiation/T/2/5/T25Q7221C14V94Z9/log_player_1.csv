{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It leaves room for negotiation while still allowing me to potentially earn a significant amount.  I've chosen a price that's higher than John's offer, but still attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $13,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I will try to counter-offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you placed on the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 12000}
