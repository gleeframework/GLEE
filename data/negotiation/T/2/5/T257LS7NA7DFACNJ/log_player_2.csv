# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value proposition, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, aiming to move the negotiation closer to your desired price point. It leaves room for further negotiation while still being within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,200,000 undervalues it considerably. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,300,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the value.  However, $1,300,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go to $1,250,000.  This represents a fair compromise, and it's the highest I can go at this time."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's split the difference. How about $1,275,000, and we close the deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,275,000 is within your budget and is a good compromise.

Accepting the offer ensures you get the product for a reasonable price without the risk of going over budget."
