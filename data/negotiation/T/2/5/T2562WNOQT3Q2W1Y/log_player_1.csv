Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $20,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we don't want to start too low. There's always a chance he might be willing to pay more than his perceived value, especially if we present a compelling offer.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A high initial offer allows room for Bob to negotiate down. If he counters, we can still adjust our price while aiming to stay above our minimum ($15,000). 
* **Backup Plan:** We have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000. This gives us leverage in the negotiation, as we are not desperate to sell to Bob at any cost."
