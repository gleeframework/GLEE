"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I think it will be incredibly valuable for you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $950,000."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We're beginning with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a high profit.
* **Leaving Room:**  We don't want to start at $1,000,000 because it leaves no space for Bob to feel like he got a deal.
* **Alternative Option:** We have John as a backup, guaranteeing us at least $800,000. This allows us to negotiate confidently with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product seems great, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a good offer, we're still early in the negotiation. We started high for a reason.  Rejecting this offer signals to Bob that we believe in the product's value and are willing to negotiate further for the right price.  We'll aim for a counteroffer that keeps us above our minimum while still being enticing to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand your perspective. This product offers significant value, and I want to find a price point that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?"", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This classic negotiation tactic often feels fair to both parties. 
* **Strategic Concession:** We're coming down $50,000 from our initial offer, showing Bob we're willing to negotiate.
* **Still Above Minimum:** This price still keeps us comfortably above our $800,000 safety net (John's offer)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we split the difference at $875,000? This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're now getting closer to our bottom line, but we still have room to negotiate. Bob is consistently trying to ""split the difference,"" which suggests he's willing to move higher. Rejecting this offer maintains a firm stance and shows we're aiming for a price closer to our target."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you clearly see the value this product offers.  While I'm motivated to make a deal, I need to be sure it's the right fit financially.  How about we land at $890,000?  This reflects my commitment to getting this in your hands while ensuring a fair agreement."", 
""product_price"": 890000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** We're only coming down $10,000 this round, signaling we're getting closer to our limit.
* **Justification:**  We're providing a reason for our counteroffer (being ""sure it's the right fit financially""), which can make it seem more reasonable. 
* **Positive Language:** We're using phrases like ""motivated to make a deal"" and ""fair agreement"" to maintain a collaborative tone.
* **Still Above Target:**  This price point still nets us a significant profit over our minimum."
