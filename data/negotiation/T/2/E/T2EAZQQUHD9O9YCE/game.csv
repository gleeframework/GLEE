"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $8,000 is too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to make a reasonable profit while still getting you a great deal. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,
