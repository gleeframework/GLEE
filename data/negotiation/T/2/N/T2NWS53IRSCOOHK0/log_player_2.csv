"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to your business, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I will reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. I want to save as much money as possible, and $1,100,000 is too high for me.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'd like to make a counteroffer to Alice. I think the product is worth a lot to me, but $1,100,000 is too high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing. However,  $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential and the return on investment you'll see. I could consider closing the deal at $1,050,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to negotiate further. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Alice's counteroffer.
