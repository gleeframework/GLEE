"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a special price. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I have to consider my costs and the value I'm looking to get from this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $14,000 is closer, it's still a bit above what I had in mind.  Could you do $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're a serious buyer, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $13,000 for the product. I can offer it to you for $13,500. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is a business transaction, and you need to make a profit.  $13,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference at $12,750? That's my final offer.",12750.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not sure I'm willing to meet you at $12,750. I've already gone below my minimum target price with my previous offer, and I'm not sure I can go any lower. However, I'm willing to make one final counteroffer. I can offer it to you for $13,250. That's as low as I'm willing to go.",13250.0,Alice,7,
