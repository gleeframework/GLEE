Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $130. This is a fair starting point, considering it's worth $120 to him and I need to make at least $120.  I'm confident that we can find a mutually agreeable price through negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for $100, as it's worth at least $120 to me. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm willing to come down to $115. This is a fair compromise, considering the product is worth $120 to Bob and I need to make at least $120.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $110 is a reasonable compromise. It's above my minimum threshold of $120, and further negotiation might risk losing the sale altogether.  I'll accept his offer and move on."
