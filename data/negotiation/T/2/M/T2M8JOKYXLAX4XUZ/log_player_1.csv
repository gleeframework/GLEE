{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $13,000 is still higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and it's closer to my ideal price of $14,000.  It's a good deal for me and I'm willing to accept it."
