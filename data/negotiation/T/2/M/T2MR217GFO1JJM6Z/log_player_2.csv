"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $20,000. I believe it will be highly beneficial for you, even considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your budget and John's offer. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

This counter-offer is a starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still leaves room for negotiation upward. It also signals that I'm serious about buying but looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective, $8,000 is too low for me. Could you consider $17,000? I'm willing to negotiate to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $17,000 is still much higher than John's offer and my budget. I need to signal that I'm willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $17,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $10,000? That's my best offer."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

This counter-offer serves a few purposes:

* **Strong Signal:** Offering my maximum budget shows Alice I'm serious but won't go higher. 
* **Pressure:** It puts the ball in her court. She either accepts a decent profit, or risks losing the sale.
* **John as Leverage:** I don't explicitly mention John, but implying I have other options adds pressure."
