"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the market value, but I'm still not willing to let go of the product for $900000. Considering our conversation, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $1100000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
