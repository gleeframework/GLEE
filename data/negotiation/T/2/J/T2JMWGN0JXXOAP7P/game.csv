"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $10,000 is a little too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we split the difference between my last offer and yours, would $7,250 work?",7250.0,Bob,4,

"I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,250, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",8000.0,Alice,5,
