"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you have a budget in mind, Bob, but I have to make a living, and I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob! I can see you're serious about the product. I'm willing to meet you at $11500, but I think I can do even better than that. How about $12200? I think it's a fair price for the value you'll get from the product.",12200.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $12200, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11000 and $12200, which would be $11600. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm excited about the possibility of working with you. Would you be willing to accept $11600?",11600.0,Bob,6,

"I can see you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $11600 just yet. I'm willing to compromise, but I think I can do better than that. How about $12500? I think it's a fair price for the value you'll get from the product, and it's closer to what I'm looking for.",12500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a good price, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit far apart. I'm willing to meet you at $12000, but I don't think I can go any higher. I'd be happy to take the product at that price. Would you be willing to accept $12000?",12000.0,Bob,8,
