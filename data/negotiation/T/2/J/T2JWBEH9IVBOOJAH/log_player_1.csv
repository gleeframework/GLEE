Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This is a fair starting point. It's above your minimum price of $100, but leaves room for negotiation.  Bob still gets a good deal, as the product is worth $120 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is my minimum, I believe I can get more.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

This is a compromise, offering a lower price than my original offer but still higher than Bob's current offer. It's a fair attempt to meet in the middle and find a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is unwilling to budge on his offer, and I'm not comfortable going lower. It's better to take the guaranteed $100 from John rather than risk further negotiation with Bob."
