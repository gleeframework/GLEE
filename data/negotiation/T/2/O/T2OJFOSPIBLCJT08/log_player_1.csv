"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm looking to get $170 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $170 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept anything lower than $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $150, which is my absolute minimum.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 150} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $150 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $140. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $140 is closer to my minimum, I'm confident that I can get my full asking price of $150 from John. There are only 6 rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing out on a better deal."
