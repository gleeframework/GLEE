"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000, which is a great deal considering its value.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering me. However, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $9,000.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which reflects the value of the product and allows us both to have a successful deal.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Since Bob is able to buy the product from John for $10,000, it's in his best interest to go with the cheaper option and buy from John."
