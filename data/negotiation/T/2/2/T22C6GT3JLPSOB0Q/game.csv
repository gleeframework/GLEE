"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $90 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $105?  That's still a fair price for both of us, and it leaves room for some wiggle room.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $95. Can you meet me at that price?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $95 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about we split the difference at $100? This is a fair price for both of us, and it avoids any further negotiation.",100.0,Alice,5,
