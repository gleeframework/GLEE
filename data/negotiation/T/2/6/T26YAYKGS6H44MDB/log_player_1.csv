"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and am open to discussing this further."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a strong offer. This anchors the negotiation at a higher point and leaves room for potential concessions. 
* **Ambitious but Realistic:** While the product is worth $1,500,000 to you (and you have a guaranteed offer), aiming for a significantly higher price is reasonable in the initial stages.  
* **Open to Discussion:**  The language emphasizes openness to negotiation, signaling that while you believe in the offer, you are willing to listen to Bob's perspective."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I hope we can reach an agreement that is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer matches John's guaranteed price, it's still significantly lower than our initial ask. We have room to negotiate and try to secure a better deal. We're aiming higher, knowing we have a safety net with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant concession from our initial offer to show flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  However, the new offer is still considerably higher than both Bob's offer and John's guaranteed price.
* **Justification:** We're reiterating the product's value to justify the high price, hoping to influence Bob's perception of its worth. 
* **Compromise Language:** Using phrases like ""fair compromise"" aims to create a sense of collaboration and encourage Bob to reciprocate with a counteroffer closer to our desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now moving in the right direction, but we still have negotiating power. While $1,750,000 is a tempting offer, we're aiming for at least $1,800,000 or close to it. We're willing to risk another round to see if we can push Bob a bit further.  We have the security of John's offer if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the inherent value here. Let's find a middle ground. I'm proposing $1,900,000. This slight adjustment reflects my desire to close this deal while ensuring a fair return on a truly unique product."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:** We're acknowledging Bob's increasing offer, creating a more collaborative atmosphere. 
* **Firm but Fair:** The counteroffer splits the difference between his last offer and our previous ask, demonstrating a willingness to compromise but also holding firm on a price above $1,800,000.
* **Closing Emphasis:**  By mentioning our desire to ""close the deal,"" we're subtly introducing a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad we're making progress. I'd like to counter with a price of $1,850,000. I think this is a reasonable compromise that respects the product's value while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,850,000 is a strong price. We've successfully negotiated a deal significantly higher than John's offer and very close to our ideal outcome. Continuing to push for more risks losing the deal altogether. It's time to accept the win and finalize the sale with Bob."
