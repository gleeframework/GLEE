"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to own this fantastic product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm confident that you'll recognize its worth, even at this premium. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I think we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I understand you see value in the product, but $1,200,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. Let's meet somewhere in the middle. How about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm proposing $1,100,000 for the product. Can you consider this revised offer?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
