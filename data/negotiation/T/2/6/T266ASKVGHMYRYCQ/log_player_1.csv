Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I think we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm proposing $1,100,000 for the product. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is stubbornly sticking below our minimum acceptable price. It's unlikely he'll drastically increase his offer in the remaining rounds.  Selling to John guarantees us our minimum price and avoids further negotiation risk."
