""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and I'm pleased to offer it to you first.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $800,000, meaning he won't pay more than that.
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Starting high allows room for negotiation.  By offering it at $1,300,000:
    * You signal the product's high value.
    * You leave space to potentially negotiate down closer to Bob's valuation while still exceeding your minimum.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price based on Bob's response and potential counter-offers."
