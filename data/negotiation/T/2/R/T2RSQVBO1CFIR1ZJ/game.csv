"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100? It's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $100. How about we meet in the middle at $95? I'm willing to pay that price",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $95 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $98. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen.",98.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm not willing to go up to $98. I'm thinking more along the lines of $92. That's the highest I'm willing to pay for the product,92.0,Bob,6,
