"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit steep for me, though. I'm thinking closer to $7,000.  What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $7,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it's worth much more. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  While I agree this product is valuable, $11,500 is still a stretch for my budget. How about $9,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and land at $10,250? That feels like a fair compromise where we both feel good about the deal.",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close. I'm willing to offer $9,500. That's a strong offer and reflects my honest budget for this purchase.",9500.0,Bob,6,
