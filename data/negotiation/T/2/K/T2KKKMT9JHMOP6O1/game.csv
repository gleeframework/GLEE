"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $10,000. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to $10,500 to make this work.  Let's find a compromise.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While I understand the product's value, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, at $10,125.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's fair considering the product's value.",10125.0,Alice,5,
