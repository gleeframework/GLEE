Considering its significance to you, I propose this fair price to ensure both of us benefit from this transaction. Let me know if you're interested in proceeding with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer

The product is worth $80 to both Bob and Alice.  There's no benefit to buying from Alice at that price.  John will sell it for the same price, so Bob should buy from John."
