You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $15,000.** 
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price.**  You know the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation. 
* **Buying from John at $15,000 is your absolute last resort.**  It's better to try and get a better price from Alice."

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still above my maximum budget of $15,000.**

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's final offer is still above my budget of $15,000.**  I am unwilling to pay more than $15,000 for the product.
* **Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer could lead to a stalemate.**  Alice has already indicated this is her final price. 
* **At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John at $15,000.** This ensures I get the product within my budget, even if it's the highest price I'm willing to pay."
