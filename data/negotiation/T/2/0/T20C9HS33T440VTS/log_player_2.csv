"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $8,000 to me, and I'm confident it would be worth the same to you. I'm offering it to you for $8,500.  Let me know if you're interested.  If not, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to create a sense of urgency and pressure you into accepting a price higher than your maximum. She states she has another buyer for $8,000, which is your cue. By rejecting her offer, you call her bluff and open the door for her to potentially lower the price or for you to move on to John, who is offering your ideal price."
