Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob.  
* **Room for Negotiation:**  A starting price of $19,000 leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, giving you the chance to reduce the price slightly while still remaining above your minimum. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's reaction to this initial offer will give you insight into his level of interest and potential for a successful negotiation. If he outright rejects it, you haven't lost anything because you have John as a backup."
