"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You want at least $800,000, so this offer is well above that.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, so there's still room for him to counteroffer.
* **It demonstrates you're serious:**  A high starting offer shows that you're confident in the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given the product's value to me, I'd be willing to pay $850000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below your ideal target. You have 8 rounds left to reach a better deal. It's worth trying to counter-offer and see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $850,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This price is still fair for both of us, as it allows for some profit on my end while still being below the value the product holds for you.  Let's try to find a compromise here."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counteroffer is halfway between your last offer ($950,000) and Bob's offer ($850,000). This shows you are willing to negotiate but are not willing to settle for a low price.
* **Maintaining a reasonable profit:** While $900,000 is still below your ideal target, it's above your minimum, ensuring you make a reasonable profit.
* **Emphasis on compromise:**  The message stresses the importance of finding a compromise that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still looking for a lower price.  $875000 feels like a fair compromise that benefits us both.  It's a good price for me and still allows you to make a profit.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $875,000 is closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still quite a bit lower than your ideal outcome. You have 6 rounds left to try to close the deal at a higher price.  It's worth seeing if you can nudge Bob a little higher with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $875,000 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $887,500.  This price is still a good deal for you, given the value of the product, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's find a middle ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 887500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Small concession:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to compromise but not drastically. It's a smaller step down than the previous round, indicating you're getting closer to your bottom line. 
* **Maintaining a good deal for both:** This price still gives Bob a significant discount, making it attractive to him. It also allows you to make a profit that's closer to your ideal target.
* **Emphasis on compromise:** The message highlights the need for a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer, but I'm still looking for a slightly lower price.  $880000 feels like a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal.  Let's get this finalized. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $880,000 is very close to your counteroffer of $887,500.  You only have 4 rounds left, and at this point, it's likely that further negotiation will only lead to a lower price. 

* **Acceptable profit:**  While this price isn't your ideal, it still allows you to make a significant profit.
* **Closing the deal:**  Accepting this offer allows you to secure a deal and avoid risking a further decrease in price in the remaining rounds. 
* **Avoiding John:**  Selling to John for $800,000 would result in a lower profit.

It's a good strategy to close the deal at a price that's acceptable to both parties, especially when you're nearing the end of the negotiation."
