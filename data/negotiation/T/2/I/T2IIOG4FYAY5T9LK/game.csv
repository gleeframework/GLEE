"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, my budget for this purchase is strictly $8,000. I'm willing to offer you $6,000  for the product. I believe this is a fair offer considering my budget constraints.",6000.0,Bob,2,

This still represents a significant discount for you, considering the product's true worth and the benefits it can bring to your business.",7500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $7,500 is closer to my budget, I'm still aiming for that $8,000 mark. How about we meet in the middle at $7,000? This offer keeps us both reasonably happy with the deal.",7000.0,Bob,4,
