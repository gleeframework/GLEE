Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair and accurately reflects its worth. What are your thoughts on this offer?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,400,000 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, but still secures a significant profit for you. 
* **Backup Option:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $1,200,000 provides a safety net.  You don't want to offer it to Bob for less than this amount.

**The message is crafted to be:**

* **Positive:** Highlighting the ""fantastic opportunity.""
* **Justified:**  Mentioning the ""value and potential"" helps support the high price.
* **Open to Discussion:**  Asking for Bob's thoughts encourages a response and potential negotiation."
