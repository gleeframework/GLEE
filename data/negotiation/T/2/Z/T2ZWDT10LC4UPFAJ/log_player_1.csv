Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  While Bob values the product at $100, starting with an offer closer to your minimum ($150) allows room for negotiation or a pleasant surprise if he accepts immediately.
* **Appearing reasonable:**  Offering a price of $125 is a significant markup for you, but still presents a potential gain for Bob if he values the product even slightly more than $100.
* **Backup plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John, so there's no pressure to go below your minimum. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider."
