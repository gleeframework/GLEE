"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to your business. It's something I've been developing for some time, and I'm confident it can significantly increase your revenue. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a substantial discount from its true value, and I'm confident you'll find it to be an incredible investment. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
