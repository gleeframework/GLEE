"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,500 is my absolute minimum.  This is still a great price considering what it's worth to you. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $12,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but I can't go any lower than $12,000. This is a fair price considering what the product is worth to you, and it also covers my minimum acceptable profit.  Let's close this deal, I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",12000.0,Alice,5,
