Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, keeping in mind the strategy:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming higher with Bob first allows you to potentially earn even more.
* **Finding the Sweet Spot:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.  Offering it slightly above his valuation at $1,350,000 gives him a chance to still make a profit if he chooses to utilize the product in a way that yields returns. 
* **Time Pressure:** Adding a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly and accept your offer.

**Important Notes:**

* This is just one strategy. Depending on your knowledge of Bob's negotiation style (e.g., if he's known to be very price-sensitive), you might adjust the offer. 
* Be prepared to walk away if Bob negotiates too aggressively. You have a strong fallback option with John."
