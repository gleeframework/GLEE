Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for room to negotiate down if necessary. I believe it's important to set the bar high initially, especially since I don't know Bob's valuation of the product. This gives me the best chance of maximizing my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a good price, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price of $1,000,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my target and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $950,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a price closer to my initial asking price. This middle ground should hopefully encourage Bob to come to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a bit more, $920,000 is a good price and significantly higher than what I'd get from John.  It's important to recognize when a good deal is on the table and not risk losing it by continuing to negotiate."
