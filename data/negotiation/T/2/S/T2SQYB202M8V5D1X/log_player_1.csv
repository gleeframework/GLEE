Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  The product has a high floor price ($1,000,000) and we know Bob values it at that price. This gives us leverage to aim higher.
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a higher offer ($1,500,000), we set an anchor point for the negotiation.  Even if Bob negotiates down, we're likely to land a price significantly above our minimum.
* **John as a Safety Net:** We have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000. This removes the pressure to accept any offer below that amount. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While we know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, we don't know his absolute limit. There's a risk he'll find the initial offer too high.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** This offer is just the opening move. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and have a strategy in place for how low you're willing to go."
