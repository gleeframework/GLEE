Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, $12,000 is the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while.  Do we have a deal?

**Reasoning:**  Alice has shown she won't go below $12,000.  Since you can get the product from John for $10,000, it's the best financial decision to buy from him and save the extra $2,000."
