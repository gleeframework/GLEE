"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm aware it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that is fair to both of us. Let's discuss a price of $900,000. This would be a win-win scenario, allowing you to acquire a valuable asset while I secure a strong price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
