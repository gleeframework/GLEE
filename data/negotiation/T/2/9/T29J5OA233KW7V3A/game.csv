,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $14,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Would you be willing to consider $11,500?  I think that would be a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,500. I think that's the lowest price I can reasonably accept for this product.",13500.0,Alice,5,
