"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $50
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth no more than $80 to Bob, and Alice's offer is $50, it makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price.  There's no reason to accept the first offer when there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 40}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. Offering $40 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $50, but still leaves room for further negotiation.  It's a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $55. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $55
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $55 is closer to Bob's maximum value of $80, but there is still room to negotiate a lower price.  Bob can try to get a better deal before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 45}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway.  $45 is a compromise between his previous offer of $40 and Alice's latest offer of $55. It shows Bob is serious about buying but still wants a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $60
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum value, but it's still higher than Bob is willing to pay.  Bob should continue to negotiate and see if Alice will come down further before he considers buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 50}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering Alice's initial price of $50. This shows that he is willing to compromise and is getting closer to the deal. However, he is still leaving room for Alice to come down slightly.  It's a reasonable counteroffer to see if Alice will budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $65
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $65 is getting closer to Bob's maximum value of $80, but with only 3 rounds left, the chances of further negotiation are slim.  It's risky to continue, and Bob is better off taking the guaranteed price of $80 from John to ensure he gets the product."
