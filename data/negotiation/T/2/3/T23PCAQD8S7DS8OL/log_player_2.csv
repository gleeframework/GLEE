"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $12,000. I think it's a great value and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is much higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. There's significant room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $12,000 is quite high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting significantly lower than my maximum price, I leave room for negotiation and gauge Alice's flexibility. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will help me understand how motivated Alice is to sell and what price range she might consider.
* **Alternative Option:**  I always have the option to go with John's $8,000 offer if negotiations with Alice don't go well."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $9,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice moved significantly from her initial offer, $9,000 is still above your $8,000 limit and John's offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Her willingness to negotiate suggests there might be wiggle room to get closer to your desired price.
* **Leverage:**  You have the security of John's offer, giving you leverage to push for a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** This offer shows Alice that you're willing to move closer to her price, but you're still seeking a significant discount. 
* **Midpoint Negotiation:** Aiming for a price midway between her last offer ($9,000) and your previous offer ($6,000) is a common negotiation tactic.
* **Staying Competitive:**  While $7,500 is still slightly above John's offer, the potential cost savings from negotiating with Alice are worth pursuing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $8,500. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is Firm:** Alice has clearly stated this is her final offer and the lowest she'll go. 
* **Minimal Savings:** Negotiating further with Alice is unlikely to result in a significant discount below $8,500.
* **John's Offer is Better:** John's offer of $8,000 remains the best option, saving you $500 compared to Alice's final price. It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed better deal."
