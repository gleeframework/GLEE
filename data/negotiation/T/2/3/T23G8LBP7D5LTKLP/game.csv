"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe will be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $10000.  This is a great price considering its potential. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in the product, $10000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $7500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7500 is a bit too low for me. Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $9000.  This is a fair price that reflects its potential. Let's see if we can close this deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $9000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8500? It's a fair price that's within my budget and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can make this happen.",8500.0,Bob,4,
