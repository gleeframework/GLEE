"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe will be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $10000.  This is a great price considering its potential. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in the product, $10,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  Offering $7,500 is a substantial reduction from Alice's initial offer.  This establishes a lower starting point for the negotiation and gives Alice a clear incentive to consider a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7500 is a bit too low for me. Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $9000.  This is a fair price that reflects its potential. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's budget.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to try and get a better deal.  There's still room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? It's a fair price that's within my budget and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to bridge the gap between his budget and Alice's current price.  Offering $8,500 shows a willingness to compromise while staying within his financial limits. This counteroffer might encourage Alice to accept, as it's a significant step towards his initial budget."
