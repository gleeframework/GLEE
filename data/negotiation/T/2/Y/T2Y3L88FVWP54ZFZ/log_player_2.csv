# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $130.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $130.** This is within your budget of $150.
* **Buying from John would cost you $150.**
