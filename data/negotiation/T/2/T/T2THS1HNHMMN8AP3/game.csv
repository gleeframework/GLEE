"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value we both place on it.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the product's true value and the significant discount I've already offered, I'm willing to go down to $950,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $900,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  This price reflects the value of the product to me, and I believe it's fair for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
