Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly extraordinary."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000 and I have a guaranteed buyer at that price gives me a strong position to negotiate from.
* **Aiming High:**  Starting with a significantly higher offer ($1,500,000) allows room for negotiation. Even if Bob negotiates down, there's a good chance of securing a price well above my minimum.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity, attempting to justify the high asking price. 

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Depending on Bob's response and negotiating style, I might adjust my approach in further interactions."
