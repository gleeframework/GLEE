{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,500. It's in great condition and worth a lot to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also a ""round"" number, making it easier for Bob to counteroffer. 

I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net, but I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to get a good deal. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept, I need to hold out for a better price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $9,800 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $10,500? This is still a great deal for you, given the product's value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $10,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $10,250 is a good compromise. It's significantly closer to my desired price than John's offer. I'm willing to close the deal at this point."
