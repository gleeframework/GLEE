"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to get a good deal. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",9800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $9,800 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $10,500? This is still a great deal for you, given the product's value to you.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $10,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10250.0,Bob,4,
