Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $175. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you should aim higher with Bob to maximize potential profit. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** Starting with a $25 markup (from your minimum of $150) is a reasonable opening offer. It allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Positive Messaging:**  The message focuses on value to Bob, not just the price itself, increasing the chance of acceptance. 

**Important:**  This is just an opening offer. You can adjust your price in further interactions with Bob based on his response."
