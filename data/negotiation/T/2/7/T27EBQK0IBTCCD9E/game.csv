"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you a price of $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  This price reflects the value I see in it and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm glad we're having this conversation. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is a compromise that I think reflects the value of the product while also being mindful of your budget constraints.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price, but $1,150,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000,  which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is a final offer, as I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Let's close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're able to have this conversation. However, I still feel that $1,100,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
