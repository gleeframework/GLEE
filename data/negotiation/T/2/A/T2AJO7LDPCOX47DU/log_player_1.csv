Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product.  It's a unique opportunity and I believe it has great value for you. My initial price is $1,400,000. I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price. Let's discuss."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,400,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm very interested in your product, but I can only offer $850,000 at this time. This is a fair price considering the value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). While it's tempting to consider $850,000, I have 10 rounds and a guaranteed buyer in John for $1,500,000. It's worth exploring if we can find a middle ground with Bob in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still a bit below where I need to be. Considering your interest and the value of the product, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. I believe this price is fair and reflects the potential benefits to you.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still outside my comfortable range.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it reflects the potential value for both of us.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we keep working together. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target. I'm confident we can still find a better deal. I have 6 rounds left and John is a secure option for $1,500,000.  I'm going to keep pushing for a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  Given the potential value of this product for you, I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement quickly. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). I have 4 rounds left and a guaranteed buyer in John for $1,500,000.  I want to see if we can close the deal at a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your constraints, but $1,000,000 is still below my minimum.  However, I'm willing to be flexible to reach a deal. I'm proposing $1,050,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs, and allows us to finalize this transaction. Let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1,050,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping to finalize this deal at a lower price. I'm willing to offer $975,000.  This is a very fair price considering the value of the product to me, and it allows us to close this deal quickly.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds remaining, Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While I could make another counteroffer, it's highly unlikely that Bob will come up to my target price within these two rounds.  Therefore, it's more beneficial to sell the product to John for $1,500,000, securing the highest possible price and avoiding further negotiation risk."
