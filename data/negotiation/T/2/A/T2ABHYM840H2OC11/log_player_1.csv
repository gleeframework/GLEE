"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but also ensures I'm getting a good price. It's important to remember that Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's a good chance he'll accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to sell for the bare minimum. I believe I can get a better price, and I'm not yet at the point where I'm ready to settle. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to lower my offer to $13,500. This is still a good price for me, and hopefully, it will be enticing enough for Bob to accept. It's a middle ground between my previous offer and his counteroffer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is getting closer to my desired price. I'm not sure if I can squeeze out much more in the remaining rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  It's a good deal for me, considering my minimum price is $12,000."
