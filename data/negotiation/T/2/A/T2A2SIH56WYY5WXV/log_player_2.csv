"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit your business. Considering its value and potential impact, we're proposing an initial price of $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. It's within your budget, but you can likely get a better price. It's worth exploring counteroffers and seeing if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $950,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'd like to offer $850,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects the value we both see in the product, and allows for a fair and mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. After careful consideration, we've decided to counter your offer with a price of $900,000. This price still reflects the high value of the product while allowing for a reasonable negotiation process. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to your desired price, but $900,000 is still above your target. It's worth seeing if you can push for a lower price before considering John's offer.  You have time and the opportunity to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $875,000. This demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring your product and hopefully we can reach a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, thank you for your continued interest in our product. We've reviewed your latest offer and have decided to counter with a price of $890,000. We hope this proposal will facilitate a successful transaction that benefits both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $890,000 is very close to your desired price point. It's within your budget and a good deal for you, considering you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  Continuing to negotiate might save you a little more, but it risks losing the deal with Alice and potentially having to buy from John at a higher price.  It's a good time to accept and close the deal."
