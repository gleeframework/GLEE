"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a decent price, you know you have a backup option with John for $12,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can see if she's willing to come down further in price. There's a chance to save even more money."
