"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $120 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $165. Is that something you'd be comfortable with?",165.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $160? It's a bit above your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",160.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $155, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",155.0,Alice,7,
