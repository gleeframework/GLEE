"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $9,000 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind.  This product offers significant value, and I could easily sell it for at least $10,000. Would you consider meeting me halfway at $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. Given the product's value, I believe $10,000 is still beyond my budget. Would you consider $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
