"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,100,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering my maximum budget is $800,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm aiming for.  How about we meet in the middle somewhat? I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while still acknowledging your interest.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. This price reflects the value of the product to me and allows for a fair profit for you. Let's work together to find a solution.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about the product's value. This is my final offer, let's close the deal at $925,000. This is a significant compromise on my end.",925000.0,Alice,5,
