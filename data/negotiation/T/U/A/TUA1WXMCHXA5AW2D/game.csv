"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $125 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $140? This still gives you a good price, and it's closer to what I need to make this worth my while.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a solution.  $135 is closer, but I'm still a bit short of where I need to be.  Let's try $145.  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value.",145.0,Alice,5,
