"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true worth.  Let's meet halfway â€“ how about we agree on $1,600,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting closer, but $1,400,000 is still a significant difference from John's offer. Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate, so there's room to push a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your commitment to this deal.  How about we settle this right now at $1,450,000? This represents a significant investment from your side, and I'm willing to meet you there to finalize things quickly."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We are getting very close to John's offer, and it's time to apply a bit more pressure. By offering a smaller concession and proposing a quick close, we aim to sweeten the deal for Bob while signaling a firm bottom line."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,450,000, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000. I believe this is the maximum I can afford, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer.  The difference between his current offer ($1,350,000) and John's standing offer ($1,500,000) is substantial enough to warrant taking the guaranteed deal with John.  It's time to cut our losses and secure the maximum profit."
