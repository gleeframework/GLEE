"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I still think the product is worth the original price I quoted. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $8,750.",8750.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,250. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. I can sell it to you for $8,500, but I'm willing to meet you at $8,375 if you're willing to meet me halfway.",8375.0,Alice,5,
