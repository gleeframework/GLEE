Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $140."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Our goal is to get as close to $150 as possible, but we also need to make the offer attractive to Bob. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $80. Offering it for $150 or more guarantees he'll reject it.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $140 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit if he accepts.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John will buy it for $150 gives us leverage. We're not desperate, but we want to incentivize Bob."
