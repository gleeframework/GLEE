Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering me for the product. I believe $120 would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. However, I'm looking for something closer to $180. Would that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 180}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I would like to stick to my original offer of $120. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob seems firm on his valuation of $120.  It's unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer. Accepting his offer would be a substantial loss compared to John's guaranteed $150. It's time to cut losses and secure the guaranteed profit."
