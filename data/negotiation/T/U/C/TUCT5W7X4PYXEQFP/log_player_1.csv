Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I understand he wants to stay within his budget, $9,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for less than my minimum value of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $10,500 to make this deal work. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit low, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,800. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $9,800 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not comfortable selling it for less than $10,000.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget.  However, I'm still not comfortable going below $10,200.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,900, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've decided to sell the product to John for $10,000.  The negotiations with Bob have gone on for a while, and it seems like we're not going to be able to reach an agreement. While I'd prefer to get a higher price, John is offering my minimum value, and it's time to move on."
