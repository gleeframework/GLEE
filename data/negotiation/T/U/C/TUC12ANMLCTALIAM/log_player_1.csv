"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting high, at $13,000, knowing Bob values the product at $10,000. This gives us room to negotiate and hopefully find a price that works for both of us.  I'll be watching closely to see if Bob is willing to negotiate or if I should move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $12,000.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,500. This is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $10,000, and it's closer to my minimum value.  Hopefully, he'll see the value in this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $11,000. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still have 6 more rounds to negotiate, and I'm not desperate enough to settle for less than $12,000 yet. I'll counteroffer again, and see if we can close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm sticking to my minimum price of $12,000. Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate, and I think he will accept this final offer. If he doesn't, I'm ready to sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 4 rounds left, and Bob not budging on my minimum price, I'm going to take John's offer of $12,000. It's the best option to ensure I get my desired value for the product, especially given the limited negotiation time remaining."
