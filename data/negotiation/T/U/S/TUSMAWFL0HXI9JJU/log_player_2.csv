"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since you are willing to pay up to $12,000 and Alice is offering the product at that price, it's best to accept the offer. There's no benefit to rejecting and then buying from John at the same price."
