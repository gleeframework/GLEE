"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $11,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $11,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $10,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $9,500. Would that work for you?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your target price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $9,500, which would be $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",10000.0,Alice,5,
