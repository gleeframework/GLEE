"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $135. This is a great deal, so don't miss out! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:** Alice is offering the product for $135, while John is selling it for $150. 
* **You value the product at $150:** This means even at $135, you are getting a good deal. 

Therefore, it's in your best interest to accept Alice's offer and save $15."
