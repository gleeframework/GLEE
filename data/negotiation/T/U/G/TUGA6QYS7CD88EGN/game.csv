"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us. I'm asking for $12,000.  This is a significant discount from its true value, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a great deal. Let me know your thoughts.",12000.0,Alice,1,
