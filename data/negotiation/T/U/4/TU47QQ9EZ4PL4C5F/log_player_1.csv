"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm offering it to you for $175, which is a fantastic price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum to see if Bob is willing to negotiate.  It's important to start strong and be prepared to make concessions if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $140. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to drop below my minimum price just yet.  I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $140 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $160.  This is still a great deal considering the value you'll get.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $160 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $145. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me.  I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'd like to see if I can get closer to my desired price before considering selling to John. I'm going to counter with a slightly higher price, hoping Bob will be willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $145 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $155. This is a great deal, and I truly believe you'll be happy with it. Let's close this deal, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 155}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $155 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $150. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is finally at my minimum acceptable price, but I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation.  I'm concerned that continuing to negotiate will only waste more time and might not result in a better price.  John is willing to pay my desired price, so it's in my best interest to sell to him now and avoid further negotiation."
