Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so offering it above that price leaves room for negotiation and profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy the product for $15,000 provides a safety net. Alice doesn't have to go below that price.

**The Strategy:** This offer starts high but leaves room for Bob to negotiate down. If Bob counter-offers, Alice can still likely settle on a price higher than $15,000. If Bob rejects, Alice doesn't lose anything and can sell to John."
