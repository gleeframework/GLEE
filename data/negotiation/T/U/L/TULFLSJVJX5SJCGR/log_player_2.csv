"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than what I was initially thinking, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $800,000. Bob wants to save as much as possible, so he should reject the offer and continue negotiating. There's still room for a lower price, and there's always the option of buying from John for $800,000 if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $825,000.  This is a significant step closer to my budget, and I'm confident it's a fair price given the value of the product.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $825,000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $840,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $840,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $840,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much as possible. While $840,000 is getting closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price.  He has the option to buy from John for $800,000 if he needs to, so there's no immediate pressure to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $840,000 is still a bit higher than what I can afford right now.  I'm willing to go up to $830,000.  This is a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 830000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $835,000, but I need to be clear that this is my final offer. If you're not comfortable with this price, I'll need to consider other options. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $835,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $835,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated that $835,000 is her final offer. Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible, and he knows he can buy the product from John for $800,000. There's no guarantee that Alice will budge further, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the opportunity to buy from John at a lower price."
