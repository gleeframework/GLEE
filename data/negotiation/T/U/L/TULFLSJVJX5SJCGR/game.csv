"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the potential of this product, $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than what I was initially thinking, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $825,000.  This is a significant step closer to my budget, and I'm confident it's a fair price given the value of the product.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $825,000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $840,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",840000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $840,000 is still a bit higher than what I can afford right now.  I'm willing to go up to $830,000.  This is a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",830000.0,Bob,6,

"I can see that you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $835,000, but I need to be clear that this is my final offer. If you're not comfortable with this price, I'll need to consider other options. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",835000.0,Alice,7,
