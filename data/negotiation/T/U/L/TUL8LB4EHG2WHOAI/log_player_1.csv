Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to start high, hoping to get a good deal.  I know Bob values the product at $120, so $175 is a significant markup.  I'm confident that I can negotiate down from there, but I want to leave myself some room to make concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $140 is better than my minimum of $150, I think I can do better. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm going to counter with $160. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I think it's a reasonable price that still allows me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I could continue to negotiate with Bob, the risk is that the negotiation could drag on and I could ultimately end up with a worse outcome. John is offering a guaranteed $150, so it's the safest and most profitable option at this point."
