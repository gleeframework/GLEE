"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm going to have to counter with $950,000.  This price acknowledges the product's value to me while still leaving room for a fair deal for both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for everyone.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to earn a significant profit while giving you a great deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
