Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This is my initial offer to Bob.  It's a high price, but I believe it's still within a reasonable range for a product worth at least $1,200,000 to me.  I'm hoping to capitalize on any perceived value Bob might assign to the product that exceeds my minimum. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I will analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. I am prepared to negotiate but will always keep John's offer of $1,200,000 in mind as my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I am willing to accept.  While I am aware that I could sell to John for that price, I am not desperate to make the sale and believe I can still achieve a better outcome. 

I will proceed to the next round and counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial offering, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}

I'm lowering my price to $1,500,000.  This is still a significant amount, but a more reasonable compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate while still ensuring a profit for myself.  

I'm hoping this counteroffer will entice Bob to come closer to my valuation. I'm confident that we can reach a deal that's mutually beneficial."
