"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This reflects a fair price considering my needs and the product's market value.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 undervalues the true worth of this product and its potential benefits for your business. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  I believe this reflects a fair compromise and recognizes the product's unique value.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,700,000 is still above my budget.  I'm firm on $1,200,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my financial constraints. Let's find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate us working towards a deal.  However, to be completely transparent, I have another buyer ready to purchase at a significantly higher price point. I'm very interested in working with you, so I'm making one final offer at $1,450,000. This is my absolute best price, and I need a decision soon.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
