"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $6,000 is significantly below the product's value.  Could you consider something closer to $19,000?",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $19,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $10,000?  I believe that's a fair offer, considering the market value.",10000.0,Bob,4,
