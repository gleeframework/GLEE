"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $900000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it if we can come to an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a serious commitment to purchase the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $825000. I'm willing to go up to $775000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider meeting me at $775000?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $775000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $800000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value.",800000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, Alice, but $800000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to be able to make a deal that works for me. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $750000. Can you meet me at this price?",750000.0,Bob,6,
