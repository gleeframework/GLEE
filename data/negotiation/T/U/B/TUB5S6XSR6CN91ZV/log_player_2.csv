"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $170. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and what John offers. It's worth negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for the product."", ""product_price"": 100} 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower offer allows room for negotiation. It also tests Alice's willingness to come down from her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $170 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to work with you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $140. It's a great price, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** While Alice came down in price, $140 is still above your maximum budget. There's room to negotiate further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $120? That's a fair price for both of us, I think."", ""product_price"": 120}

**Reasoning:**  We're now getting closer to the later rounds.  Offering Alice your maximum price gives her a chance to accept and ends the negotiation quickly. If she rejects, you can still consider John's offer or see if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm still willing to work with you. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $130. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to $130, which is only $10 over your budget. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she might not budge, and you'll end up paying $120 from John anyway. Accepting at $130 saves you time and potential hassle."
