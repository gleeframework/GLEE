"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product. This is a fair price given its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This allows us both to walk away happy with a fair deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I can afford right now. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good compromise that allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I truly appreciate your continued interest.  While I understand your budget, $950,000 doesn't quite meet my needs.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value this product holds for you.  Let's make this deal happen.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
