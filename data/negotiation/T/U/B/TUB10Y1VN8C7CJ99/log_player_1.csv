"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product. This is a fair price given its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is still a decent amount, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation. I have 8 more rounds, and I don't want to sell to John yet, as I feel there's more potential with Bob."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This allows us both to walk away happy with a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I can afford right now. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good compromise that allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping for a higher number.  We have 6 rounds remaining, and I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob for now."
