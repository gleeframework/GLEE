Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This allows us both to walk away happy with a fair deal.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I truly appreciate your continued interest.  While I understand your budget, $950,000 doesn't quite meet my needs.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value this product holds for you.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Alice has finally reached a price that is acceptable to me. I can't risk further negotiation as I'm unsure if she will come down further. The price is still a bit high but I'm willing to accept it."
