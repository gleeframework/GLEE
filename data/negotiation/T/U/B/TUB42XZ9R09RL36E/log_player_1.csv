"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $12,000. This is a significant profit for me, while still leaving some room for negotiation.  It's also a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm offering $11,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a good profit for me. I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair price and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $9,500 is a decent profit, I'm still confident that I can get a slightly better price by continuing the negotiation.  I'm willing to risk one more round to see if I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm offering $10,500. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a reasonable price for both of us. I'm hoping Bob will see that we're getting closer to a deal and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's a significant profit for me and I'm running out of time.  If I reject this offer, I risk losing Bob entirely and ending up selling to John for a much lower price. It's time to secure the deal and move on."
