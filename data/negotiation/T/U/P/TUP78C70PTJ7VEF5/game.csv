"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think that's a more reasonable price considering the market value.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850000. Considering the product's unique value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $925000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own this incredible product. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $875000. I think that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $875000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $900000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great opportunity for you to own this incredible product. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $880000, but I think that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think that buying the product from John might be the better option.",880000.0,Bob,6,
