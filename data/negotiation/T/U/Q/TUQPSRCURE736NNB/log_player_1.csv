Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $175. This is above his perceived value of $100, but it gives him room to negotiate and still potentially get a good deal. It also leaves me some room to potentially lower the price if necessary.  

I'm confident that I can sell the product to John for $150, so this is my starting point. I'll see what Bob's response is and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with a price of $140. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this will be a good middle ground that we can both agree on. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to sell the product to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob at a higher price, I don't want to risk going back and forth endlessly. I'm confident I can get my minimum from John, so I'll go ahead and sell to him."
