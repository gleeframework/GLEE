"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I've done some research and I think it's a bit pricey at $100. Can you meet me at $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $80 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $95. This would still give you a great value, and it's a fair price for me.  Let me know what you think.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $95, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I've been looking for a good deal on this product, and I'm not sure I can justify paying that much. Can you meet me at $85? That's the maximum I'm willing to pay.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence.  While $85 is still below what I can accept, I'm willing to make one final compromise.  How about $105? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to move forward with another buyer. Let me know your decision.",105.0,Alice,5,
