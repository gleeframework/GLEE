{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial offer is above Bob's value but below my minimum:** This ensures Bob might be interested in negotiating, while also giving me some room to lower the price if needed.
* **Positive framing:** The message focuses on the value for Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer.

**Next steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  Great! I've made a profit.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or counter with a price closer to my minimum. 
* **If negotiations stall:** I can always fall back on John's offer of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I've done some research and I think it's a bit pricey at $100. Can you meet me at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While I'm open to negotiation, I cannot accept a price lower than $120. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my minimum and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.

**Next Steps:**

* **I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum of $120, but still below John's offer of $120. This keeps the negotiation moving and might convince Bob to pay more.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $80 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $95. This would still give you a great value, and it's a fair price for me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is closer to my minimum:**  $95 is closer to my minimum of $120, but still below John's offer of $120. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while also ensuring I don't lose too much money.
* **Positive framing:** The message emphasizes the value Bob would get and uses language like ""fair price"" to appeal to his sense of reason.
* **Maintaining negotiation:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation going and gives Bob an opportunity to accept a price that is more favorable to me. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've achieved a successful negotiation. 
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or counter with a price closer to my minimum. 
* **If negotiations stall:** I can always fall back on John's offer of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $95, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I've been looking for a good deal on this product, and I'm not sure I can justify paying that much. Can you meet me at $85? That's the maximum I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While I'm happy with Bob's interest,  $85 is still below my minimum price of $120.
* **John's offer is a safer option:**  Since I can sell the product to John for $120, it's not worth risking a sale for a lower price. 

**Next Steps:**

* **I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum ($110 or $115) and see if he's willing to compromise further.** 
* **If Bob continues to reject offers, I'll move forward with selling the product to John for $120.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence.  While $85 is still below what I can accept, I'm willing to make one final compromise.  How about $105? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to move forward with another buyer. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is close to my minimum:** $105 is closer to my minimum of $120, but still below John's offer of $120, leaving room for a possible agreement.
* **Final Compromise:**  The message emphasizes this is my final offer,  creating urgency and potential pressure on Bob.
* **Highlighting the benefit to Bob:** I remind Bob that this is still a good deal for him.
* **Setting a clear path forward:** I emphasize that if Bob rejects this offer, I will move on to John, implying I am serious about my price.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've achieved a successful negotiation with a price close to my desired minimum.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll move forward with selling the product to John for $120, as it's not worth continuing negotiations at a loss."
