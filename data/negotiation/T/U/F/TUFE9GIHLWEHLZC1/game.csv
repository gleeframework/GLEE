I have a great product that I think you'll love. Would you like to make an offer on it?,140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $140 is a bit steep for me.  How about $130?  I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $130 is still a bit lower than I was thinking. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $137.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",137.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $137.50 is still a bit high for me.  How about $135?  That's a fair compromise, and it would allow us to finalize the deal quickly.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! I can see that you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to come down a bit more to meet you at $138. I think that's a great price for both of us, and it's a good compromise.",138.0,Alice,5,
