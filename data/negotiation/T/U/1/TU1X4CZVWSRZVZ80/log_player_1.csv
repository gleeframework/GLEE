{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a bit above Bob's perceived value, but it still leaves some room for negotiation and is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. It also shows a willingness to be flexible and reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product at $9,500. However, I am only willing to pay up to $9,000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9,250? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, I believe $9,250 is still beyond my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $9,000? I'm confident this would be a mutually beneficial arrangement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob has come back to his initial offer, and while $9,000 is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation. It's time to move on and sell to John for a guaranteed $10,000."
