"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $1,250,000?  This is a fair price given the value to me and leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise that still leaves some room for both of us to be satisfied with the deal. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
