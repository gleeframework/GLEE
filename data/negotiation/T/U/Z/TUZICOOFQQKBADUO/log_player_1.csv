"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product and I think you'd really find it valuable.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $80? That's the maximum I'm willing to spend on this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is firm at his maximum price of $80, which is our minimum acceptable price. There's no point in further negotiation as it's unlikely we'll gain anything. Selling to John guarantees us our desired profit with no further hassle."
