"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget. Would you consider $15,500? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",15500.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $16,750 is still a bit above my budget.  How about $16,000?  I think that's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still make a good profit.",16000.0,Bob,4,
