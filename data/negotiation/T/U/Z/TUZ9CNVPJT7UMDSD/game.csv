"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today.  I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm confident it will meet your needs. To make this a smooth transaction, I'm initially offering it at $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $15,000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is still a good price for you considering it's worth $12,000 to you.  Let's see if we can work something out.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. This product offers exceptional value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer would be more reflective of that. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value this product highly, but $13,000 is still too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a fair compromise considering your value and my budget.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing we're still a bit apart on price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $9,500 isn't quite there yet. How about we split the difference again and settle at $11,250?  This would be a fair deal for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,5,
