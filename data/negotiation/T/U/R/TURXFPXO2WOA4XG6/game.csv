"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which is worth a lot to me, at least $12,000. I'm offering it to you for $14,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth the price. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $14,000 is a bit steep for me, though. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about $11,000? That's a pretty good compromise, I think.",11000.0,Bob,4,
