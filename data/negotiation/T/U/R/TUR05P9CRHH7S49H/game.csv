"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a significant discount from its true market value.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would that price point be feasible?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $750,000, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
