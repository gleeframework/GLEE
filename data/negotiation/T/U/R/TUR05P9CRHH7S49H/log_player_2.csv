"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a significant discount from its true market value.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $750,000, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

Alice is clearly trying to get closer to her minimum, and while I could try to negotiate further, $825,000 is a reasonable price within my budget. It's better to accept a good offer now than risk the negotiation breaking down and having to pay John's higher price."
