$14,000 is still too high.  I'll counteroffer again, but I'm getting closer to my limit."

I'm getting close to my limit with Alice, and it looks like we're at a stalemate.  It's not worth risking further negotiation with Alice for the possibility of a slightly better price.  I'll go with John's offer for $8,000."
