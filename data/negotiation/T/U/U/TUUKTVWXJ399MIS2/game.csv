"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you.  Given its features and value, I'm offering it at $20,000.  What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $14,000 is still beyond what I can afford.  I'm really pushing my budget here, but I'd be willing to go up to $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation. I understand where you're coming from.  Let's try $12,000. This is a significant price reduction and reflects my desire to find a fair deal.",12000.0,Alice,5,
