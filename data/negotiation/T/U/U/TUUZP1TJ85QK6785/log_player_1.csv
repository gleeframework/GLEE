Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $10,000 is higher than Bob's $8,000 valuation, giving him some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're willing to accept anything above $12,000, so you have room to negotiate downwards.
* **It shows confidence:** By proposing a price higher than Bob's perceived value, you demonstrate that you believe your product is worth more.

However, be prepared to negotiate!  If Bob rejects this offer, you'll need to decide whether to counter-offer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While it's tempting to take the $6,000, it's too far below your value for the product.  It's better to reject his offer and counter-offer to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $6,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

This counteroffer does the following:

* **Shows flexibility:**  You're willing to lower your price from the initial $10,000, demonstrating a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Keeps a significant margin:** $8,500 is still above your minimum acceptable price of $12,000, giving you a substantial profit.
* **Provides a clear number:**  You've given Bob a specific price, inviting him to either accept or propose a counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we split the difference and settle at $7,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,250 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your value for the product. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can reach a more favorable price.  There's a good chance that Bob might be willing to increase his offer slightly, especially since he's already indicated a willingness to negotiate.  

You can try a counteroffer slightly higher than his $7,250, or you can try to understand why he's unwilling to go higher and address those concerns. Remember, your goal is to get as close to your minimum as possible, but ideally, you want to get even more than that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $7,250 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $7,750, which is a fair compromise.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7750}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Shows a willingness to compromise:** You're coming down from your previous offer, showing a genuine desire to reach an agreement.
* **Still maintains a profit:** $7,750 is still above your minimum acceptable price of $12,000, ensuring you make a profit.
* **Positions you for a potential final agreement:** This offer is closer to Bob's last offer, increasing the likelihood of a deal. 

By proposing $7,750, you're demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a good deal for yourself.  Hopefully, this will persuade Bob to accept your offer!"
