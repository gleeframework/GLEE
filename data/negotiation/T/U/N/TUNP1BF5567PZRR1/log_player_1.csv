"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate and still make a good profit. 
* **Appealing to Bob's value:**  I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob to emphasize the potential benefit of the deal for him.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm ending with an open-ended question, inviting Bob to respond and begin the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 and doesn't reflect the product's value to me.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  I have 10 rounds to reach a deal with Bob, and I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price. 
* **Selling to John is not ideal:** While selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, I'm aiming for a better outcome and believe Bob is willing to pay more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price still gives you a significant profit, and it's the closest I can come to meeting your price while still ensuring I get a fair return on my investment."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer that's roughly in the middle between my initial offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's offer ($900,000). This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a good profit margin.
* **Highlighting the benefit for Bob:** I'm emphasizing the ""significant profit"" Bob would still realize at this price, appealing to his financial interests.
* **Justifying the price:** I'm explaining the reason for my counteroffer (fair return on investment), making the offer seem more reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good price, but $900000 is my absolute maximum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $975000. This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping you'll consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still low:**  While closer to my minimum, $975,000 is still below my ideal selling point.  I'm not desperate to sell and want to see if I can push further.
* **John is a safety net:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $1,000,000 gives me the flexibility to hold out for a better price.
* **Negotiation space remains:**  With multiple rounds left, I believe I can still convince Bob to increase his offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my asking price.  However, $975,000 is still not quite there.  I'm prepared to go down to $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise that allows you to get a great deal and me to get a reasonable return on my investment.  Let's try to find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to compromise:** I'm offering a lower price than my previous counteroffer, showing that I'm flexible and interested in reaching an agreement.
* **Balancing profit and negotiation:**  $1,025,000 is a good middle ground between my desired price and Bob's offer. 
* **Highlighting fairness:**  I'm emphasizing ""fair compromise"" and ""reasonable return,"" emphasizing the benefit for both parties. 
* **Urgency to find common ground:**  I'm highlighting the need to find a solution that works for both of us to encourage a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1025000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $980000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $980,000 is still under my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  With 4 rounds left, I can still make a counteroffer and try to secure a higher price.
* **John provides a solid backup:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me a profit, but I'm hoping to maximize my earnings.

I'm going to make a counteroffer and see if I can push Bob a little higher."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $980,000 is close, but it's still just a bit short.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This would be a win-win for both of us.  You'd get the product for a great price, and I'd get my minimum asking price.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** I'm finally offering my minimum price of $1,000,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still ensuring I get a fair deal.
* **Framing it as a win-win:** I'm emphasizing the benefits for both of us, making the deal seem mutually advantageous. 
* **Creating a sense of urgency:** I'm suggesting we ""close this deal"" to encourage Bob to accept and avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to get the best deal possible. I'm willing to meet you at $990000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While Bob's offer is only $10,000 below my minimum, I'm running out of time and negotiation rounds.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, ensuring a profit.
* **Risk of going lower:**  Rejecting Bob's offer and continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower final price, especially with only 2 rounds remaining. 

I'm choosing to sell to John because it's the safest option to ensure a decent profit and avoid the risk of a lower price if negotiations with Bob continue."
