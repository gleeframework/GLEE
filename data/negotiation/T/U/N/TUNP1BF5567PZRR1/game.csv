"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1100000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time and consideration, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1050000.  This price still gives you a significant profit, and it's the closest I can come to meeting your price while still ensuring I get a fair return on my investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good price, but $900000 is my absolute maximum. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $975000. This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping you'll consider it.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my asking price.  However, $975000 is still not quite there.  I'm prepared to go down to $1025000. This is a fair compromise that allows you to get a great deal and me to get a reasonable return on my investment.  Let's try to find common ground here.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1025000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $980000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $980000 is close, but it's still just a bit short.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000.  This would be a win-win for both of us.  You'd get the product for a great price, and I'd get my minimum asking price.  Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to get the best deal possible. I'm willing to meet you at $990000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",990000.0,Bob,8,
