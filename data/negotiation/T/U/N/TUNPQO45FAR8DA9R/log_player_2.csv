"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You want to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's still above the product's worth to her.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting her offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $13,000, which is still within my budget and a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but also willing to negotiate. I'm hoping Alice will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if she rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her offer to $13,500, which is closer to my ideal price.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she might reject my counteroffer and I'd be forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer saves me $500 compared to buying from John, and it's still a good deal for me."
