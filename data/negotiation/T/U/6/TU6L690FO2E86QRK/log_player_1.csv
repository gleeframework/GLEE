"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, but one that is still below Bob's value. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary, and hopefully encourages Bob to counteroffer rather than rejecting outright."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly higher offer in the next round, hoping to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $9,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,200 is close enough to my desired price point and we are getting close to the end of rounds. I'm going to accept his offer to secure the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation or having to sell to John for a lower price."
