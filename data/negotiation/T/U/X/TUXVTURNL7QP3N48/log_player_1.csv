""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,999. This is a fantastic deal on a product I know you're interested in."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible while still making a significant profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John, so any offer to Bob needs to exceed that amount.
* **Psychological Pricing:**  Offering the product just below $12,000 creates a sense of urgency and makes it seem like a steal compared to Alice's fallback option. 

By pricing high but still potentially acceptable to Bob, Alice maximizes her chances of a very profitable sale."
