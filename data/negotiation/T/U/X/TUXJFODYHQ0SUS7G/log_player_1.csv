"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $200. I think you'll find it's a great deal for its value."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a budget. I would like to propose a price of $150 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is his maximum valuation of the product. There is no room for negotiation upwards.  Since I can sell the product to John for $150, which meets my minimum acceptable price, it makes the most sense to sell to John immediately and not waste time on further negotiation with Bob."
