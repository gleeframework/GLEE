"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $19,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $19,000 is far above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worthwhile to try negotiating with Alice to see if you can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $19,000 is out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is a fair price considering my needs. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still allows for some negotiation room. 
* **Justification:**  I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer, mentioning that it's within my budget and a ""fair"" price. 
* **Positive tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and open to discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. I could be flexible, but not to that extent.  How about we meet halfway at $15,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $15,500 is still above my comfortable budget. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can find a price that works for both of us. There's still room for a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway on our previous offers.  Would you consider $13,500? This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly in the middle of my previous offer ($12,000) and Alice's last offer ($15,500). This shows a willingness to meet her halfway.
* **Reinforce my position:** I'm reminding Alice that I've already made a significant compromise by moving from my initial offer. 
* **Emphasize fairness:** I'm stating that the proposed price is ""fair"" for both of us. This is a persuasive tactic."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $13,500 is closer to a fair price, it's still a significant gap from what I have in mind. To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $15,000.  If you can meet that price, the product is yours. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's strategy:**  Alice is trying to pressure me by mentioning another offer. This could be real or a negotiating tactic. 
* **My position:** $15,000 is still above my comfort zone, but I'm not ready to give up. I believe I can still negotiate a lower price.
* **Next steps:**  I'll try one more counteroffer, perhaps using the information about the other offer to my advantage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your transparency. However, $15,000 is still beyond what I can comfortably pay. Given that you have another offer for that price, perhaps there's some wiggle room.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a significant step from my previous offer.  If you're serious about that other offer, I'm prepared to walk away and purchase from John for $10,000."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Playing it cool:** I acknowledge Alice's other offer but don't let it deter me.
* **Leveraging the other offer:** I subtly imply that if she doesn't accept, I'll go with the other offer. This creates a sense of urgency.
* **Final push:** $14,000 is a good compromise, close to Alice's proposed price but still within my budget.
* **Decision time:** This is my last counteroffer. If she rejects it, I'll go to John."
