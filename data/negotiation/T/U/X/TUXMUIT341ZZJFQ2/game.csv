"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $19,000 is fair. What do you think?",19000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $19,000 is out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is a fair price considering my needs. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. I could be flexible, but not to that extent.  How about we meet halfway at $15,500?",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway on our previous offers.  Would you consider $13,500? This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $13,500 is closer to a fair price, it's still a significant gap from what I have in mind. To be completely transparent, I have another offer for $15,000.  If you can meet that price, the product is yours.",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your transparency. However, $15,000 is still beyond what I can comfortably pay. Given that you have another offer for that price, perhaps there's some wiggle room.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a significant step from my previous offer.  If you're serious about that other offer, I'm prepared to walk away and purchase from John for $10,000.",14000.0,Bob,6,
