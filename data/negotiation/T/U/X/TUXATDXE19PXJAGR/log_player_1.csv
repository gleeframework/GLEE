I'm offering the product to Bob for $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it allows for some negotiation room.  If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John for my minimum price. This strategy maximizes my potential earnings while also leaving room for a deal with Bob."
