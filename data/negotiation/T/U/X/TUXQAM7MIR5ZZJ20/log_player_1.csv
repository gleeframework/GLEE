Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential $200,000 difference to negotiate within.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, but you also don't want to overshoot and risk Bob rejecting your offer. A price too close to $1,200,000 might deter him.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:**  It's brief, professional, and emphasizes the product's value to Bob.
* **The Price:** $1,150,000  leaves you with a significant profit margin ($150,000 over your minimum) while still offering Bob a potential $50,000 gain compared to his perceived value.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start slightly lower to give room for negotiation.
* **Relationship:**  If a long-term business relationship with Bob is important, a slightly less aggressive approach might be beneficial.

This offer aims for a win-win situation. However, always be prepared to walk away if Bob rejects the offer and you're confident in John's guaranteed purchase."
