"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice!  $1,200,000 is a bit out of my range. Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,025,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,025,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now. Let's try to meet in the middle again - I'm willing to offer $900,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair offer that allows us both to come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,025,000 and $900,000, which would be $962,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement here.",962500.0,Alice,5,
