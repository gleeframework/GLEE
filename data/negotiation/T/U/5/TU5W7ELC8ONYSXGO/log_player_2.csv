"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice!  $1,200,000 is a bit out of my range. Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,025,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's budget. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if a lower price can be reached before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,025,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now. Let's try to meet in the middle again - I'm willing to offer $900,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair offer that allows us both to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,025,000 and $900,000, which would be $962,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $962,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $962,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. It's unlikely she'll go lower, and there's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a successful outcome. At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John and secure the product within his budget."
