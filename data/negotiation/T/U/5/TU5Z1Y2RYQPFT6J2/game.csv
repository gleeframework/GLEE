"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product but $200 is a bit steep for me.  How about $130? Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $200 might be a bit high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. How about we meet in the middle at $170? Let me know what you think.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $170 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's try $155 - that's a fair price for both of us. ",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $155 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to compromise again. How about we try $165? It's a bit closer to my original price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",165.0,Alice,5,
