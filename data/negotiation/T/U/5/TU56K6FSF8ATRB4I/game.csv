"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,300,000 at this time.  I believe this is a fair price, considering the value it holds for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 falls short of what I'm looking for. This product has significant value that I'm confident justifies a higher price point. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000? This recognizes the value while still offering you a good deal.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of this product. However, $1,750,000 is still outside my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000, which is a substantial increase from my previous offer. This price reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my budget. I hope you'll consider it.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
