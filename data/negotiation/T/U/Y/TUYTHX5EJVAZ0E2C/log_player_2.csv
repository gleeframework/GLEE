"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is close to your maximum budget, but you can potentially get a better deal by negotiating. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if you can lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is interesting, but I'm looking to get a better price for this product.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,200,000 undervalues its potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,300,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,300,000, which is still within my budget and represents a significant saving compared to John's offer of $1,500,000.  While I could potentially continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice will reject further counteroffers, and I might end up paying more. Accepting this offer is the most financially advantageous option."
