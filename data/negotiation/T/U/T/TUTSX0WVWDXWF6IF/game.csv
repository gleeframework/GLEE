"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product, but also takes into account my budget constraints. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to be mindful of my expenses. Can we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000, which recognizes the value you place on this product and my need to ensure a fair return. I believe this is a good compromise and a fair price for both of us. Let's aim to close this deal in this round.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $925,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose $912,500. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and still reflects the value I see in the product. Can we meet at this price?",912500.0,Bob,4,
