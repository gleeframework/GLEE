Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I think it would be a valuable addition to your business. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** Offering $10,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly less than my minimum value ($12,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Potential for counteroffers:** This price allows for a back and forth with Bob, potentially leading to a higher price.
* **Alternative buyer:** I can always sell to John for $12,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,500 is well below my minimum value of $12,000 and even significantly lower than my initial offer of $10,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can get a higher price by negotiating further with Bob or selling to John. 
* **Counteroffer strategy:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to send a counteroffer, potentially closer to my desired price. 

I'm willing to engage with Bob further, but I won't settle for a price that's significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm proposing a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This shows willingness to negotiate while maintaining a profitable sale for me.
* **Middle ground:** $9,250 is the midpoint between my previous offer ($10,000) and Bob's current offer ($8,500).
* **Motivational language:** I'm highlighting the ""good deal"" for Bob and emphasizing the desire to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8,750. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a limit:**  Bob's offer of $8,750 is still significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000.  Further negotiation is unlikely to bring him much closer to my desired price.
* **Time is money:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I don't want to waste time on a buyer who is unwilling to come closer to my minimum.
* **Guaranteed sale:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $12,000, which is my minimum desired amount.

I'm confident that selling to John is the most efficient and profitable option at this point."
