"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $115 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $105.  Let me know if you're interested.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find this product very useful. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $110, but I'm still a bit hesitant at that price. How about $108?  I think that's a fair compromise.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However,  $108 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $109.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be very happy with the product.  What do you say?",109.0,Alice,5,
