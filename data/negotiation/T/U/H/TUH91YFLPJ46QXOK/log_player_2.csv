It's better to reject the offer and make a counteroffer to save money. $18,000 is above your budget, and you can likely get a better price."

It's still worth trying to negotiate further.  While $16,000 is getting closer to your limit, there's still room for a better price."

Alice's offer is getting close to your limit, but it's still over your ideal price. At this point, it's better to go with John's offer and secure the product for $15,000.  You've successfully negotiated a lower price, and you don't want to risk Alice rejecting your next counteroffer and pushing the price even higher."
