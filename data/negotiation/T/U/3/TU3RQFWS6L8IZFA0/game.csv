"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product.  Given its value and potential, I'm starting negotiations at $2,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time. This is my maximum, considering the value I place on it. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $800,000 is too low to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This reflects the true value of the product.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,900,000 is still far too high. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This reflects a compromise on my side, but it's still within my budget and what I believe is a fair price for this product.  Let's try to close this deal. ",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be frank, $1,000,000 is still quite a ways off from what I had in mind.  Let's try $1,600,000. This offer stands for this round only, as I do have other interested parties.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1,600,000 is closer, it's still above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000, which reflects a significant compromise on my part. I believe this price accurately reflects the value of the product for me, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.  If this doesn't work, I'll need to move on to other options.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
