Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be frank, $1,000,000 is still quite a ways off from what I had in mind.  Let's try $1,600,000. This offer stands for this round only, as I do have other interested parties.

If this doesn't work, I'll need to move on to other options."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
