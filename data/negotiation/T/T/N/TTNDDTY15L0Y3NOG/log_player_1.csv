Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would greatly benefit you, and I'm asking for $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I can afford to start high with Bob.  Here's why I chose $19,000:

* **Anchoring:** This high initial price sets an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind. Even if he negotiates down, the starting point is already very favorable to me.
* **Potential for High Profit:**  There's a chance Bob values the product more than he lets on or is willing to pay a premium for immediate acquisition. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This price leaves ample room for negotiation. If Bob counters, I can gradually lower the price,  still aiming for a price significantly higher than $10,000.

**Important Note:** This strategy is aggressive and assumes I'm comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting the initial offer."
