"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to sell you this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. This offer reflects the true worth of the product's potential.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has value, $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 undervalues the product's true potential and the benefits it offers. I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet in the middle. How about we consider $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down, but $1,600,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  To be frank, I'm thinking closer to $950,000. That feels like a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product. What do you say?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty and your willingness to negotiate. However,  $950,000 is simply too far below the product's true market value. I've got another buyer interested who sees its full potential. I'm willing to give you one more chance to make a serious offer. If we can agree on a price of $1,400,000, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll need to move forward with the other buyer.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
