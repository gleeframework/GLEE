"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to sell you this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. This offer reflects the true worth of the product's potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has value, $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than my maximum budget to leave room for negotiation. Alice's initial offer was also far above her own valuation of the product.
* **Gauge Reaction:** This offer will help me gauge Alice's flexibility and how aggressively she wants to sell."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 undervalues the product's true potential and the benefits it offers. I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet in the middle. How about we consider $1,600,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice came down in price, $1,600,000 is still significantly more than my $1,000,000 limit and her own valuation. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Her willingness to negotiate suggests we can find a better price. I'm willing to see how low she'll go before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down, but $1,600,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  To be frank, I'm thinking closer to $950,000. That feels like a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Increase, Staying Below Limit:** I've made a substantial jump from my previous offer to demonstrate seriousness while remaining below my $1,000,000 limit.
* **Direct and Honest:**  Being upfront about my price range encourages Alice to be more realistic and hopefully avoids a drawn-out negotiation.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will show if Alice is truly willing to make a deal within my acceptable range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty and your willingness to negotiate. However,  $950,000 is simply too far below the product's true market value. I've got another buyer interested who sees its full potential. I'm willing to give you one more chance to make a serious offer. If we can agree on a price of $1,400,000, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll need to move forward with the other buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the Limit:** Alice's offer is still significantly above my $1,000,000 limit.
* **Potential Bluff:**  While she mentions another buyer, this could be a tactic to pressure me into a higher offer. 
* **Guaranteed Savings:**  John's offer is guaranteed, saving me a considerable amount of money. There's no point in continuing the negotiation if I can secure the product for a much lower price elsewhere."
