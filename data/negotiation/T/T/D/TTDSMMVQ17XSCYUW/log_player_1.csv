Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but  $14,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $12,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and I believe I can potentially get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $13,500.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $13,500 is still a little out of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $13,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and it's a good deal considering we are only halfway through the negotiation rounds."
