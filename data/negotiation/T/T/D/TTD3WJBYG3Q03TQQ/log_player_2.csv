"Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially do better.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best price possible. Starting with a counteroffer of $700,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, giving Alice room to negotiate while still allowing Bob to potentially save a considerable amount of money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer significantly. While Bob could potentially continue negotiating, the risk of Alice walking away or the negotiation dragging on for too long is present.  $775,000 is a good price that saves Bob a significant amount of money compared to buying from John. It's a smart move to accept the offer and finalize the purchase."
