**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still higher than the product's worth to me ($800,000).  I can try to negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. I think this is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product to both of us.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $875,000 is within my budget and is a good compromise.  It's still higher than the product's value to her, but I'm saving $375,000 compared to buying from John.  Accepting this offer is the best option for me."
