**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly getting firmer on her price, and while we could try to negotiate further, we're getting into diminishing returns.  $580,000 is a significant savings compared to John's offer of $1,000,000. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk Alice walking away or the negotiations stalling out."
