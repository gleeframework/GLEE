Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a great fit for you! I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $110, which is higher than the product's value to Bob but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and highlighting the potential benefits of the product for Bob.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit. I'm starting high and hoping Bob will accept, but I'm also prepared to negotiate. If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and potentially make a lower counteroffer myself. If the negotiation stalls, I have the backup option of selling to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price ($100), I'm still not willing to settle for $90.  I believe I can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price. This shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price and not willing to give away the product for significantly less than its value to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $95?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $95, which is a compromise between my initial price ($110) and Bob's offer ($90). 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and emphasizing that my counteroffer is a fair deal for both of us. 

**Strategy:**

By offering a middle ground price, I'm showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. This increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer. If he doesn't, I still have the option to sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of further price concessions and the potential for a prolonged negotiation isn't worth it. Selling to John for $100 guarantees me my minimum desired profit. 

**Strategy:**

This decision reflects a shift in strategy.  While I initially aimed to maximize profit, I'm now prioritizing a guaranteed sale over potentially higher but uncertain gains."
