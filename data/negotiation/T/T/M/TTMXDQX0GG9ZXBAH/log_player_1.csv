Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also establishes a starting point for bargaining. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my offer, but I also have John as a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to compromise that much. I will counteroffer Bob to see if we can find a price we both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $120?  This would still be a good deal for you, as it's significantly more than what John is offering me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $120 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point.  I'm not willing to go lower than $150, which is what John will offer me.  I'm going to sell the product to John to ensure I receive a fair price."
