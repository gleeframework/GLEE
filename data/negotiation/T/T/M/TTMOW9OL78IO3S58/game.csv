"Bob, I understand your position, but $900000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this valuable product. How about $1000000? This is a significant compromise on my end, and it's the lowest I can go.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer to a deal. However, $950000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway once again, but I need at least $975000 to make this work. This is my final offer before I consider other options.",975000.0,Alice,5,
