Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering. Accepting Bob's current offer would mean a $500 loss compared to John's guaranteed purchase. It's time to cut negotiations with Bob short and secure the guaranteed profit."
