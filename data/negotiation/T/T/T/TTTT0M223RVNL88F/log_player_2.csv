"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's always better to try and negotiate a better price.  Since Alice's offer is below your maximum, rejecting and making a counteroffer is a good first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000} 
```

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $50,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal, but it's still within a reasonable range.  We'll see if she's willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is at my maximum price.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee she'll budge.  It's better to secure the product at my limit now and avoid the risk of losing the deal altogether."
