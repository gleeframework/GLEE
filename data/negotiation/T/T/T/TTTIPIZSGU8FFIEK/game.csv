"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fantastic deal, as you know it's worth significantly more to you. Let's make this happen!",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1075000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,075,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This still leaves you a significant profit, and it's a price I'm comfortable with.  Let's make this happen!",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to go up to $1,080,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1080000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate. While I value a deal, $1,080,000 is simply not enough for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,090,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with.",1090000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not convinced we're at a fair price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,085,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.",1085000.0,Bob,6,
