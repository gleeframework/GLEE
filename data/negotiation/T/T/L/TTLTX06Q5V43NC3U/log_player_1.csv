"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd love it. I'm offering it to you for $130.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. How about $90? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than Bob's perceived value of $80, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I can come down to $110. That's still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down to $110. I'm still a little higher than I'd like to be.  I'm happy to pay $100.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not comfortable selling for $100. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation. There are still several rounds left, and I'm willing to see if I can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $105? That's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle.  I'm still a bit above my limit. I'd be willing to do $95.  How about we close it there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $95 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not willing to sell for less than $100. There are only four rounds left, and I want to see if I can secure a better price. I'm confident I can still get a better deal by continuing the negotiation."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $100?  That's a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
