Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $150 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation is Irrelevant:**  You know you have a guaranteed buyer (John) willing to pay your minimum acceptable price ($150). Therefore, Bob's valuation of $80 doesn't factor into your strategy.
* **Maximize Profit:** Your goal is to maximize your earnings. Since John provides a price floor, you should aim to sell it to Bob for the highest price possible, which is your minimum acceptable price.

**Important Note:** While Bob is unlikely to accept this offer knowing the product's value to him, there's no harm in attempting to secure the highest possible price first."
