{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum, ensuring I profit handsomely. It also leaves room for negotiation, allowing Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal while still ensuring I get a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a good price, I'm aiming for a higher profit. Rejecting this offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my ideal $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 doesn't quite meet my needs. How about we split the difference and settle at $950,000? This would allow us both to secure a fair deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'd like to make another offer. How about we meet at $920,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $920,000 is close enough to my desired price point that accepting it makes sense.  It's significantly higher than selling to John, and while it's slightly less than my ideal price, it minimizes the risk of further negotiation and potential rejection."
