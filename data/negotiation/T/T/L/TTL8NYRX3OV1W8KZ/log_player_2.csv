``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $18,000 is way over Bob's budget and he can get the product for $12,000 from John.  It's worth seeing if he can negotiate a better price with Alice."

Bob should offer the lowest price he's willing to pay, which is the price John is selling for. This puts the pressure on Alice and shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $16,000 is closer to his budget, it's still higher than what he can get from John. It's worth seeing if he can negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Bob should offer $14,000, a price halfway between Alice's offer and his own budget. This shows he's willing to compromise while still trying to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $12,000.  Alice is only willing to come down to $15,500, which is still higher than Bob's budget. There's no guarantee she'll budge any further, and it's not worth risking further negotiations.  John offers the best price, and Bob should take it."
