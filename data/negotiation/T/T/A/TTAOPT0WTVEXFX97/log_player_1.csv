Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $10,500? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $11,000? I'm confident this is a great deal for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $10,750. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's close the deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, $10,750 is still a good deal and significantly better than selling to John for $10,000.  I'm confident that I can make a good profit on this deal."
