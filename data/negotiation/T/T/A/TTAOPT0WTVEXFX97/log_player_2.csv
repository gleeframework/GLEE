"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $10,500? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, but it's still within a reasonable range considering the product's value to him ($12,000) and Alice ($10,000).  This establishes a starting point for negotiation and shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $11,000? I'm confident this is a great deal for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a better price than $12,000, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price. Rejecting the offer gives Bob another opportunity to negotiate and potentially reach a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $10,750. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's close the deal!"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate by making a slightly higher counteroffer.  He's trying to find a middle ground, bridging the gap between his initial offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows he's willing to compromise while still aiming for a good price."
