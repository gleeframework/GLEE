"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to maximize the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $1500000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",1100000.0,Alice,3,,,
