Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, given its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $11,500 is higher than your minimum of $10,000, ensuring you're making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so there's wiggle room for him to counter-offer without feeling like he's losing out.
* **It shows you're serious:** A high initial offer demonstrates you're confident in the product's value and willing to negotiate. 

Remember, the key is to find a balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring Bob doesn't walk away. Keep in mind the potential of John as a backup buyer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum:** You've established your minimum price at $10,000, and Bob's offer is just $500 above that. This is not a significant enough profit margin for you.
* **You have a backup buyer:** You can always sell to John for $10,000, ensuring you won't lose money.
* **You can counteroffer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, you can make a counteroffer, potentially securing a price closer to your desired $11,500.

**Next Steps:**

You should counteroffer Bob with a price between $10,500 and $11,500.  This demonstrates your willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a decent profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while staying within your budget. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle ground:** This offer is a compromise between your previous offer of $11,500 and Bob's offer of $10,500. 
* **Shows flexibility:** This demonstrates that you're open to negotiation and willing to find a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Keeps profit margin:** $11,000 is still a significant profit for you, exceeding your minimum of $10,000.

By offering a middle ground, you are showing Bob that you are serious about making a deal. This counteroffer increases the chances of closing the deal while still securing a decent profit for yourself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we split the difference and do $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit margin:** While $10,750 is not your ideal price, it's still a profit of $750 over your minimum and $250 more than what John is offering. 
* **Potential for further negotiations:**  Even if you accept Bob's offer, there's still a possibility of continuing negotiations with him in the future. You can leverage your connection with him for potential future deals.
* **Avoiding risk:**  There's no guarantee that Bob will accept another counteroffer, and you could end up having to sell to John for $10,000.

By accepting Bob's offer, you ensure a decent profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation that might not yield a better outcome."
