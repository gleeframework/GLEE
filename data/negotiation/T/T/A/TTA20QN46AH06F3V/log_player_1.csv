Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm happy to offer it to you for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll love it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum because I want to see if Bob is willing to pay close to my value.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to stay within my budget of $100. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to sell the product for such a low price. It's worth at least $150 to me, and I can get that from John. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget. I'm willing to come down to $125, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer,  demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still protecting my profit margin."
