Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1200000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price. $900,000 is too low, and I believe we can find a better compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This would still give you a great deal, and allow me to get closer to my desired price. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1000000 for the product, which is my absolute maximum.  This price would provide you with a fair deal, and it allows me to stay within my budget. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and it's also what I could get from John. I'm happy to close the deal with Bob, and we can avoid further negotiation."
