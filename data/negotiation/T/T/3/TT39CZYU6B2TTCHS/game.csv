"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $1,300,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value you'll get from the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,300,000 is closer, but still a bit too high for my budget. How about we land at $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,125,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to compromise further. I'll counteroffer at $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
