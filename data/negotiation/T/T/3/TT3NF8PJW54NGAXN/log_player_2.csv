"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $2000000. This is a competitive price considering its value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice's offer is far too high. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."

This is a serious offer, and I believe it reflects the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 500000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your serious offer, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. Considering the value of the product and the initial offer I made, I'm willing to compromise and make a counteroffer of $1750000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still reflects the product's worth. I'm open to further discussion and finding a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's counteroffer is still significantly higher than Bob's budget.  Bob should reject this offer and continue negotiating."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,750,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $700,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I see in the product and my budget.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're willing to go up to $700000, but I'm still not convinced that's a fair price for this product. Considering the value I know it holds, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm thinking more in the range of $1200000. This is a compromise, but I believe it's closer to the product's true value. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's counteroffer of $1,200,000 is still too high for Bob.  While it is lower than previous offers, it's still significantly over his budget.  At this point, Bob is better off buying the product from John for $800,000.  John's offer is within Bob's budget, and there's no guarantee that he'll be able to get Alice to come down to a more acceptable price."
