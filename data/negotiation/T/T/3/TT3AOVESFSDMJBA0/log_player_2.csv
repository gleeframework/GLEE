"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price that reflects its significant worth to you. I understand its value to you is $1,500,000, and I'm willing to negotiate a fair price that benefits both of us. My offer is $1,200,000. This price allows you a substantial profit while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment. Consider this offer carefully, as rejecting it means I'll be selling it to another buyer for a significantly lower price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
