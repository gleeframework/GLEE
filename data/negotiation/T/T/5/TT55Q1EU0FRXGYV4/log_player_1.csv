Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm offering $1,400,000, which is still significantly below my minimum value of $1,500,000. This allows for some back-and-forth negotiation without me losing too much.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I will assess his counteroffer and determine whether to accept or reject it.  I will also consider how much time I want to spend negotiating with Bob before I switch to John, who is guaranteed to buy for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $900,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $1,500,000 and even lower than my initial offer of $1,400,000. 
* **Time is valuable:**  I don't want to waste time on negotiations that won't lead to a profitable outcome. 
* **John is a guaranteed sale:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value, and therefore is the best option right now.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a higher price to see if we can find a middle ground.  If he rejects this counteroffer, I will immediately sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply not enough for me.  However, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my last offer ($1,400,000) and Bob's offer ($900,000).  This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  There's still some room to negotiate lower if Bob counters again. 
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I will analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or reject it. If he rejects my counteroffer, I will immediately sell to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair compromise given our respective needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too low:**  $1,000,000 is still well below my minimum value of $1,500,000.
* **Time is valuable:** I've already gone through multiple rounds of negotiation, and Bob is showing a reluctance to meet my needs. 
* **Guaranteed sale:** John is a guaranteed buyer at my minimum price, making this the most logical choice.

**Next Steps:**

I will contact John and finalize the sale to secure the best possible outcome for myself."
