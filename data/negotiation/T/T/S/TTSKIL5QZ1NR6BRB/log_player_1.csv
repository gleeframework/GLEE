Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000:** This is a starting point that is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $8,000. It gives you some room to negotiate.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and engaging, aiming to pique Bob's interest. It also mentions the product being a ""great fit"" for Bob, hoping to create a connection. 

By offering a higher price initially, you can gauge Bob's interest and potentially start the negotiation process. You can then adjust your price based on his response and continue negotiating until you reach a mutually acceptable price or decide to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm interested in your product, but I'd be willing to pay $7500. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than your absolute minimum of $8,000, it's still lower than the $10,000 you initially offered.  You have room to negotiate, and rejecting his offer keeps the bargaining process open. 

**Next Steps:**

You will now counteroffer Bob with a price that is closer to your desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $7,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This would still be a good deal for you and allow me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** The offer is $8,500, which is a compromise between your previous offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $7,500.  This shows you're willing to negotiate, but still maintain a price that is closer to your desired value.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the ""good deal"" Bob would be getting, making it more appealing. It also reinforces your willingness to compromise, further encouraging negotiation. 

By making this counteroffer, you are showing that you are serious about selling the product to Bob but also firm on your desired price. This keeps the negotiation open and allows for a potentially successful outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $8500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $8000.  This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is your minimum acceptable price.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a high chance he'll reject your counteroffer, forcing you to sell to John at the same price. Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale at your desired price point."
