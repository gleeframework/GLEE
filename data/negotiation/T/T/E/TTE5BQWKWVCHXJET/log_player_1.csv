Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a good starting point to consider.  I believe this price is fair, as it's still less than what the product is worth to him ($15,000), and it allows for some profit on my end."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is better than selling to John, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. I believe it's a fair price that still leaves some room for negotiation."
