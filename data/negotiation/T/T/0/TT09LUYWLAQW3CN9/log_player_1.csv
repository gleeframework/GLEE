Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for you, and a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** The message highlights the benefit for Bob (a ""great deal"") and emphasizes fairness for me.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message makes it clear I'm open to discussing the price further, encouraging Bob to counteroffer.
* **Backup Plan:** I'm keeping the option to sell to John at $1,500,000 in mind. If Bob's counteroffers are too low, I can always walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** I can likely secure a higher price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting his offer shows I'm not desperate and am willing to walk away if needed, giving me more leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too far below my asking price.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price is still a great deal for you, and a reasonable compromise for me.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  My counteroffer of $900,000 is a significant compromise from my initial offer but still above Bob's offer.
* **Emphasis on fairness:**  I frame the counteroffer as a ""split the difference"" solution, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Positive framing:**  I reiterate that $900,000 is still a ""great deal"" for Bob, encouraging him to see the value.
* **Maintain leverage:**  By not accepting Bob's low offer, I demonstrate my willingness to walk away, keeping the pressure on him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you be willing to consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While closer than his first offer, $700,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** I want to show Bob that I'm serious about my minimum price and that I'm not desperate to sell. Rejecting his offer helps maintain my negotiating position.
* **Potential for a higher price:**  There's a chance that Bob might increase his offer if he realizes that I'm not willing to budge. 
* **Opportunity to make a final counteroffer:** By rejecting, I get another opportunity to make a counteroffer closer to my desired price point.

**Next Step:** I'll send a final counteroffer, likely somewhere between $800,000 and $900,000, and make it clear that this is my final offer. If Bob rejects, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  However, $700,000 just doesn't work for me.  My final offer is $850,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  If you're not able to accept this offer, I'll have to move on to other buyers. "", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear that this is my last offer, putting pressure on Bob to decide.
* **Compromise:**  $850,000 is a significant compromise from my previous offer, showing a willingness to meet him halfway while still staying above my minimum.
* **Value Proposition:** I reiterate the value of the product, reminding Bob of the benefit he'd be getting.
* **Consequences of Rejection:**  I clearly state that if he rejects this offer, I will move on, leaving him with the risk of losing the opportunity. 

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between getting a good price for the product while still giving Bob a chance to accept a reasonable deal."
