"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice.  There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is slightly above Alice's value for the product, but still significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point for negotiation and signals to Alice that Bob is serious about purchasing the product but also wants a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is a better offer than the first round, Bob can still do better.  There's still room for negotiation, especially since Alice has already rejected a counteroffer.  Rejecting this offer gives Bob the opportunity to try and push for a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer, showing a willingness to compromise. However, he's still staying below Alice's current offer, indicating he's aiming for a price closer to the middle ground.  This keeps the negotiation moving towards a potential agreement while also ensuring Bob doesn't overpay."
