"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a high price, aiming to get as close to my minimum as possible.  The message emphasizes the value for Bob, while still pushing for a profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell. I would like to counteroffer at $950,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum of $1,000,000. I have 9 more rounds to negotiate and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's try $1,050,000.  It's a fair price considering the product's worth to you and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 
 
I'm offering a slightly lower price, but still above my minimum, and adding some more incentive by highlighting the mutual benefit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let's try $1,000,000 as a counteroffer. This gives us a bit more room to negotiate and might help us reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is exactly my minimum price.  While I could try to squeeze out more, there's a risk he'll walk away, and I'd be stuck selling to John at the same price.  It's best to take the secure deal and avoid any further risk."
