"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $20000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I would like to counter your offer with a price of $12000 for the product. This still reflects its value to us, but I'm willing to negotiate within reason. Please let me know if this is acceptable.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12000 is still outside my budget. My absolute maximum is $9000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Bob,4,

,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10500 is still pushing my budget.  My final offer is $9500. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to explore other options.",9500.0,Bob,6,

"I see your point, Bob. Considering your last offer, I am willing to negotiate down to $10000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that respects both our positions. I hope this meets your requirements.",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm really hoping to close this deal, but $10000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  My final offer is $9750.  This is the absolute most I can offer.",9750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand your situation, Bob. I am willing to accept $9875 for the product, which is a slight compromise from my previous offer. This still maintains a reasonable valuation for the product while providing some flexibility for you. I hope this helps us reach an agreement.",9875.0,Alice,9,
