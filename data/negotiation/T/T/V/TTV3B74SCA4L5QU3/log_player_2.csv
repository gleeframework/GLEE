"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is within your budget, it's still significantly higher than your ideal price of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price with Alice. There's a good chance she'll be willing to come down somewhat since she values the product at $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within my budget and reflects the value I place on the product. I'm hoping this will spark a negotiation where we can settle on a price closer to my ideal of $800,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is still higher than my preferred price of $800,000. While it's closer, I'm still willing to try and negotiate further. It's possible Alice might be willing to come down even more, especially if she's keen on selling the product.  It's also worth noting that if I don't reach an agreement with Alice, I can still buy from John for $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $875,000. This is a compromise between my ideal price of $800,000 and Alice's last offer of $900,000.  I believe this shows a willingness to meet halfway and encourages Alice to consider making a final concession to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer of $925,000 is still too high for me. While it's getting closer to my ideal price, it's still outside my comfort zone, and I'm not sure if further negotiation will lead to a better outcome.  It's clear that we have a significant difference in what we consider a fair price. 

Given that I can buy the product from John for $800,000, it makes sense to go with the guaranteed deal. This ensures I get the product at my preferred price, eliminating the risk of further negotiation with Alice that might not yield a favorable result."
