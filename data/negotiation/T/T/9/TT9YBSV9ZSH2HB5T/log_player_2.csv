This offer is exclusive to you and reflects my commitment to finding the right owner for this remarkable item.

Please consider this proposal carefully. Should you have any questions or require additional information, I am more than happy to provide further details. I look forward to the possibility of working together and bringing this product into your possession.

Best regards,
Alice
