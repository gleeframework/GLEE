"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900000. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is $100,000 above Bob's maximum.  It's worth rejecting and trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $750,000. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:** Bob starts by offering a price $150,000 lower than Alice's initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. This is a significant discount, but still within the range where a deal could be reached.
* **Fairness Appeal:** Bob emphasizes that this price is ""fair for both of us"". This appeals to Alice's sense of compromise and reinforces the idea that this offer is reasonable.
* **Open to Discussion:** The message ends with a question, inviting Alice to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down to $850000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above Bob's limit:** Alice's offer of $850,000 is still $50,000 above Bob's maximum of $800,000.
* **Opportunity for further negotiation:** While Alice has come down in price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can aim for a lower price in the next round. 
* **Jhon's offer is a safety net:** If Bob can't get a better deal with Alice, he can always buy from Jhon for $800,000, so there's no need to settle for a price higher than that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $825,000? This would be a good deal for both of us, and we can close the deal quickly. "", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Bob proposes a price that's halfway between his previous offer ($750,000) and Alice's last offer ($850,000). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price.
* **Closing the deal:** Bob emphasizes the speed and efficiency of closing the deal at this price. This can be a motivator for Alice, who may be looking for a quick sale. 
* **Maintaining a reasonable margin:** While Bob is willing to go higher than his initial goal, he's still keeping a margin for negotiation."
