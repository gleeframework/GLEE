"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects the significant benefits it will bring to your business.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $700,000. This is a fair price considering the benefits I'll receive.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 is considerably below its true worth and my initial asking price.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the value this product brings.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,000,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's meet in the middle at $850,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a profitable deal for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
