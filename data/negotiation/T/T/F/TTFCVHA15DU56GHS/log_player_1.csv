Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I will reject Bob's offer. $5,000 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm offering a price of $17,000. This is still a good deal for Bob, as the product is worth more than $15,000 to me. I'm hoping to find a price that is agreeable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I will reject Bob's offer.  While I am trying to be flexible, $6,500 is still far too low. I will continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm offering a price of $15,000. This is my minimum price, and I'm hoping Bob will finally agree to it. If he doesn't, I will sell to John at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John.  Bob's offers are getting progressively worse, and I'm running out of rounds.  It's better to guarantee the $15,000 sale to John than to risk getting stuck with an even lower offer from Bob."
