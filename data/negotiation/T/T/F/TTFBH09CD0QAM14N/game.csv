I'm offering it to you for $1025000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still looking for a slightly better deal.  I'm willing to go up to $975000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product, while still allowing me to save a significant amount.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",975000.0,Bob,4,
