"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I'm sure you'll love. I'm thinking of a price of $1,400,000 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're looking to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer is $1,400,000, which is above your maximum of $1,500,000.
* You have room to negotiate with Alice and hopefully secure a lower price. 
* Buying from John at $1,500,000 is only a last resort if you can't reach an agreement with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $1,350,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still within your budget of $1,500,000.
*  While you could try to negotiate further, it's likely Alice won't go much lower, especially since she's already met you halfway. 
* Accepting this offer saves you $150,000 compared to buying from John."
