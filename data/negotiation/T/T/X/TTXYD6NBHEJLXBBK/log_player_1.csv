"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing Bob values the product at $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate and still get a good profit. I'm also being friendly and open to discussion to encourage a positive interaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $12,500. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $12,500 is still significantly lower than my desired profit margin. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet as I still have time to negotiate with Bob and potentially get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to at least get $13,500 for this product. It's a great deal for you considering its value, and it's a fair price for me.  Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $12,000 is a fair price for the product. I'll be getting a lot of value out of it, and I'm willing to pay a premium for it. Can we meet at $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While $12,000 is getting closer to my minimum desired price, I'm still not satisfied with the profit margin.  I have more rounds to negotiate and want to see if I can push for a higher price.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John as I believe I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down to $12,800.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's close this deal and avoid going back and forth any further."", ""product_price"": 12800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,800. I'm willing to meet you at $12,200, which is the highest price I'm willing to pay. If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll have to explore other options. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,200 is getting closer to my minimum desired price, I'm still not satisfied with the profit margin. I'm not ready to sell to John yet because I believe I can get a better deal with Bob by continuing to negotiate. I have a few rounds left and am willing to push for a higher price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go lower than $12,500. This is a fair price for both of us.  We've been going back and forth for a while, and I'm running out of time.
