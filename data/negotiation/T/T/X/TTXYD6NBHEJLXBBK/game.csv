"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $12,500. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to at least get $13,500 for this product. It's a great deal for you considering its value, and it's a fair price for me.  Let's meet in the middle!",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $12,000 is a fair price for the product. I'll be getting a lot of value out of it, and I'm willing to pay a premium for it. Can we meet at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down to $12,800.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's close this deal and avoid going back and forth any further.",12800.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,800. I'm willing to meet you at $12,200, which is the highest price I'm willing to pay. If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll have to explore other options. Can you meet me at this price?",12200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go lower than $12,500. This is a fair price for both of us.  We've been going back and forth for a while, and I'm running out of time. If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll have to explore other options.",12500.0,Alice,7,
