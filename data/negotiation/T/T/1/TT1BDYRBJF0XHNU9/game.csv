"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for sale that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it for $15000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value and potential.  Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I've done some research and I think it's a bit pricey at $15000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $12500?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $12500 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go lower than $13500. This price still leaves some room for both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $12000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. If you're willing to sell it to me at this price, I'd be happy to make a deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but I'm still not comfortable going lower than $12500. I believe this price is fair considering the product's value and potential. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement, but I'm willing to walk away if we can't find a compromise.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $11500. I think this is a fair price considering the value you're offering, and I'm willing to make a deal at this price.",11500.0,Bob,6,
