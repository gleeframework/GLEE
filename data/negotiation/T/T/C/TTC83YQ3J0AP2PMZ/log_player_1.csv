Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $90?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
