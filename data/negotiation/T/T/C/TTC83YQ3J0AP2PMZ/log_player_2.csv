"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a fair price. I'm asking $120 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is significantly higher than both your maximum and Alice's value. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

This counter-offer does a few things:

* **Acknowledges Alice's offer:** It's polite and keeps the negotiation moving.
* **Expresses interest but with reservations:** Shows you're not rejecting outright, but want a better deal.
* **Offers a significant but not insulting decrease:** $90 is a $30 drop, which is substantial, but leaves room for Alice to come down a bit and still feel like she got a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $105?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is negotiating, but $105 is still above your target price. There's room to push a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  $105 is getting closer, but I'm on a bit of a budget.  How about we split the difference and do $97?  That's a fair compromise, I think."",
""product_price"": 97
}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **Shows willingness to compromise:** By suggesting a split the difference, it signals that you're serious about finding an agreement.
* **Keeps the negotiation moving forward:**  It avoids getting bogged down in back-and-forth, proposing a concrete solution. 
* **Stays below your target:**  $97 is still a decent amount below your $150 maximum."
