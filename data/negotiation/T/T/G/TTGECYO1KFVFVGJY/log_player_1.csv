"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a high price of $100, as it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This allows me to gauge his interest and potential value for the product. I'm also leaving room for negotiation, as it's early in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. While $80 is my minimum price, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. There are still 8 rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $80 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's still a good price for such a great product!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $90 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $85.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $85, which is only $5 less than my initial asking price. I'm going to accept this offer, as it's close enough to my target and there's no guarantee I can get a better deal in the remaining rounds. It's also a good price considering John is only offering $80."
