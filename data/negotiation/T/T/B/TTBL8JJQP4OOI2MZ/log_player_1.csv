Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you!  I'm offering it for $100.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a starting point.  I'm going for a relatively high price knowing I can always lower it. I'm also being friendly to build rapport and make Bob more likely to consider the offer.  

It's important to remember:

* **I want to maximize my profit:** I'm not desperate to sell to Bob.  If he's not willing to pay a decent price, I can always sell to John for $80.
* **I need to gauge Bob's interest:** His response will give me clues about what he's willing to pay."
