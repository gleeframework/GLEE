"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree your product has potential, that price point is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider coming down to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and bring substantial value to your business.  While $1,100,000 is slightly below what I had in mind, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, you're right about the product's potential, but we're still a bit apart on price.  Could you do $1,150,000?  That would be a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
