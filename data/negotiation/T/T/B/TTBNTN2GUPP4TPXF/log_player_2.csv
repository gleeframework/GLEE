{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a good deal, you can likely do better.  There's room for negotiation, and it's worth seeing if Alice is willing to come down further."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Would you consider $130?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your feedback, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $137.50. It's a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but it's still a bit higher than what I'm willing to pay. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $137.50 is still a bit too high for me. How about $135? That's a good compromise and closer to what I can afford."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! I can do $138, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $138. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $138
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $138, which is close to my target price of $135.  I'm willing to accept this offer as it's a good deal and saves me money compared to buying from John. It's also more likely that I can get a lower price from Alice in subsequent rounds."
