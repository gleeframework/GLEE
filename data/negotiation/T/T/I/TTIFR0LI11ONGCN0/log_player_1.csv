Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $900,000 is too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
