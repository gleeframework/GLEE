While $900,000 is a good offer, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

While I'd like to push for a higher price, Bob's counteroffer is getting closer to my desired range. I'm also getting towards the middle of our negotiations. It's better to secure the deal now than risk a stalemate or losing to John."
