"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, $11500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at the moment. I'm happy to pay $10500 for it.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $10500 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $11000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $10750, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's find a compromise here.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your persistence, but $10750 still isn't quite there for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10875. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's close this deal.",10875.0,Alice,5,
