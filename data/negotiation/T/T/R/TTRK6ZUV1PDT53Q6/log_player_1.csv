"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to get as close to my desired $150 as possible.  I'm assuming Bob might be willing to pay a little more than his perceived value of $80, as long as it's within a reasonable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$100 is way too low for me.  I'd rather try to negotiate further with Bob.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still keeping it above my minimum value of $150. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing offer to Bob, while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$120 is still below my minimum desired value, but it's getting closer.  I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob for a better price. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm getting close to my minimum. I'm hoping this offer will be attractive enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offers are getting closer, but I'm running out of time and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price lower than what John is offering. It's time to sell to John and secure a guaranteed profit."
