{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible without losing the sale.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,350,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly if he desires. 
* **High Anchor:**  This opening offer sets a strong anchor point, making it more likely Bob will counter with an offer closer to your desired range.
* **Alternative in Mind:** We know John will buy it for $1,000,000, providing a safety net. We don't want to scare Bob off with a price too close to his maximum, but we want to maximize our potential profit."
