"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can't justify spending $14,000 on it at this time. Would you consider lowering the price to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $10,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
