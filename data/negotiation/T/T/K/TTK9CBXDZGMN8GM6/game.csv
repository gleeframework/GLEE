"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's still well below what it's worth to me, and a good price for you considering your estimated value. Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $1,000,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to finalize this deal. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a serious offer of $950,000. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $1,000,000 or lower?",950000.0,Bob,4,
