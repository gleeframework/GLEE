"I appreciate you being willing to come down, Alice, but $100 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm sticking with my offer of $90. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement.",90.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $90, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $95. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",95.0,Alice,5,
