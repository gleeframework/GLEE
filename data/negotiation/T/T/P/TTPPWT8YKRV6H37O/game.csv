"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I'm confident this offer represents a fair deal for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,350,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  This would be a clean deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
