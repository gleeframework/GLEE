"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. I'm happy to start the negotiations at $1,500,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 800000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiations often involve starting with a lower offer than your target price. This gives room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Significantly Below Value:** Offering $800,000 is substantially below both Alice's value and my maximum price. This signals I'm serious about getting a good deal but leaves room to increase my offer. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This offer allows me to incrementally increase my bid in subsequent rounds if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I'm confident this offer represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,350,000 is still too high.  It's important to show I'm willing to negotiate, but not at any cost. I'll continue to counter-offer strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,350,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  This would be a clean deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Going To My Maximum:** Since Alice rejected my low offer, it's time to reveal my maximum price. This shows I'm serious and limits wasting time on further negotiation.
* **Mutually Beneficial:** By offering $1,000,000, I'm still getting the product below Alice's value while ensuring I don't spend more than I'm willing. 
* **Putting the Ball in Alice's Court:** This counter-offer forces Alice to decide if she's willing to accept a significant profit or risk losing the sale altogether."
