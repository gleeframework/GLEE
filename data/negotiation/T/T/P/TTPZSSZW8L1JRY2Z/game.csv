"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,250?  I'm willing to be flexible, but that's the lowest I can go.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $13,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $12,500, which would be $13,000. That's the lowest I can go.",13000.0,Bob,4,
