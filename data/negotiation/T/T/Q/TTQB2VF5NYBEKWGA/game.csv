"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you. However, I still think the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $110. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the market value.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $105. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to make a concession, Alice, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and $105, which would be $100. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,6,
