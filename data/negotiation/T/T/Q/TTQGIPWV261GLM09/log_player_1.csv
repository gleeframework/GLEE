Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 
 
This offer is a good balance between maximizing your profit and still being attractive to Bob.  Here's why:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $9,500 is significantly more than your minimum of $8,000, so you're still making a decent profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's value:**  $9,500 is less than the $10,000 Bob values the product at. This gives Bob a good incentive to buy from you.

Let's see if Bob bites!"
