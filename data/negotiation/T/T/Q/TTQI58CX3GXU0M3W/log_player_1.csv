Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can meet your asking price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

We're getting closer, but Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum.  I'll counter to see if we can bridge the gap."
