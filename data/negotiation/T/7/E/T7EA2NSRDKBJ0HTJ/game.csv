"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I can get from this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and acknowledging the value of this product. I've tried to find a middle ground here, but to be honest, $900,000 is a significant step down from what I had in mind. How about we settle at $1,150,000?  This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your interest.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate the revised offer. However, I'm still a bit far from reaching my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be more aggressive with my counteroffer. How about $1,050,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my limits.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us.  Your offer is getting closer to what I had in mind.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's value.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a compromise. However, I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to make one more aggressive move to try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. How about $1,050,000? I'm willing to take a bit of a risk to get closer to my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
