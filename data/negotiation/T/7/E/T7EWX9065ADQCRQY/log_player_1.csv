This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob. This creates space for negotiation while still allowing you to earn more than your minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1300000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1150000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
