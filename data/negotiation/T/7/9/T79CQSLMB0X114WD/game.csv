"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value to each of us. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1050000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1125000?  This would still be a great price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,3,
