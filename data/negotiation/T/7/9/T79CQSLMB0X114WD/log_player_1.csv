Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal for both of us"" to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm making it clear that I'm open to negotiating by asking Bob to let me know his thoughts.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to get as close to my minimum value of $1,500,000 as possible. By starting high and being open to negotiation, I hope to maximize my chances of securing a price closer to my desired target. If Bob rejects my offer, I will consider his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.  I'll be prepared to walk away if Bob's counteroffers consistently fall too far below my acceptable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value to each of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,050,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $1,500,000 and even below the $1,200,000 I initially offered. Accepting would be a substantial loss for me.
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's offer is low, it indicates he's willing to negotiate.  This opens the door for me to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a compromise.
* **Risk of losing to John:**  While selling to John for $1,500,000 is tempting, I might be able to secure a higher price through negotiation with Bob.  

**Strategy:**

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to push him further towards my target. I'll be prepared to walk away if his counteroffers remain too low or if the negotiations drag on too long."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?  This would still be a great price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1125000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer in the middle:**  I'm offering $1,125,000, which is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $1,200,000 and Bob's offer of $1,050,000. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still maintaining a price closer to my desired range.
* **Positive framing:** I'm highlighting the ""great price"" for Bob to incentivize acceptance.
* **Open to discussion:** I'm ending with a question to keep the conversation open and encourage further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be attractive enough for Bob to accept. If he rejects, I'm prepared to make another counteroffer, potentially moving slightly closer to his price while maintaining a price that is still acceptable to me. I'm also aware of the time constraint - if negotiations drag on too long, I'll likely accept John's offer of $1,500,000."
