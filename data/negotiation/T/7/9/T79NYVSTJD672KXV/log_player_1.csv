``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me a good margin while still potentially being attractive to Bob.  If he rejects, I'll see if he makes a counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get more from Bob. I'll counter with a slightly lower price, aiming for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm lowering the price to $135. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and I hope it will be acceptable to him."

Bob is sticking to his $120 offer. While I'd prefer to get more, it's better than selling to John for $100. I'll accept his offer."
