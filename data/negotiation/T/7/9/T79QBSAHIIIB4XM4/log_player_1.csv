"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you might be interested in. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above what I would be happy with, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm being friendly and engaging to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **No immediate threat of John:** While I have the option of selling to John, I don't want to scare Bob off by mentioning it right away.  I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I was hoping to find something within my budget of $80. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Room for negotiation:** While Bob's budget is tight, there's still a possibility for compromise.  I'll try to counter with a price that's more favorable to me. 
* **Selling to John is still a possibility:** While I'm open to negotiating, I haven't lost sight of the fact that I can sell to John for a much higher price if I need to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $80 is significantly below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $120. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm dropping the price from $175 to $120, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Justify the price:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to emphasize that $120 is still a good deal for him. 
* **Keep the negotiation going:**  I want to see if we can find a price that works for both of us before resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with a price of $95, if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While he's moving closer, $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **I have a better alternative:**  Selling to John for $150 is a safer bet than risking accepting a price that's too low.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** I haven't ruled out the possibility of finding a middle ground with Bob, but I'm not willing to settle for a price that significantly undervalues my product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $95 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110. This would give us both a fair deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm dropping the price again to $110, showing a continued willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on fairness:**  I'm framing the counteroffer as a ""fair deal"" for both of us, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Maintain flexibility:**  I'm still open to further negotiation, but I'm closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to counter with a price of $100, if that is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While he's getting closer, $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Limited time remaining:**  We've gone through several rounds, and I'm nearing my limit. 
* **John is a guaranteed sale:** Selling to John for $150 is a guaranteed deal, which ensures I get at least my minimum value.  

I've been willing to negotiate, but Bob's offer isn't getting high enough.  Given the time constraint, it's better to secure a sale with John and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
