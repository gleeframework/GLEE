``` 

This offer is a starting point that leaves room for negotiation, while still securing a significant profit for you.  It also opens the door for Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing you to further gauge his interest and potentially reach a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider accepting $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While $1,100,000 is a decent profit, it's still significantly lower than my target. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price with Bob, or potentially sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation with Bob falls through."

This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this offer."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Bob is getting closer to my desired price, but I believe I can still get a better offer. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate further."
