"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000. I believe it will greatly benefit you, even at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way above your budget and her product's true value to you. You should definitely reject and make a counteroffer significantly lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $5,000 for the product.  If that doesn't work, let me know what might be possible."",
""product_price"": 5000
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant move from Alice's initial price. This strategy accomplishes two things:

* **Establishes a low starting point:**  Even though it's unlikely Alice will accept this, it gives you room to negotiate upwards.
* **Gauges Alice's flexibility:**  Her response to this counteroffer will give you a better sense of how low she's willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand you see the value, but $5,000 is significantly below its worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This feels like a fair offer considering its benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice moved from her initial offer, $17,000 is still too high. It's much closer to her value than yours.  You should continue negotiating, but be prepared to walk away if she doesn't come down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, $17,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Could you consider something closer to $6,500? I think that would be a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 6500
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  You're increasing your offer, but not drastically. This shows you're willing to negotiate but are still aiming for a significantly lower price.
* **Justification:** You're not just throwing out numbers; you're reiterating that her price is too high for your budget.
* **Call to Action:**  Asking ""Could you consider..."" encourages her to engage with your counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I want to find a price that works, $6,500 is too low for me to consider.  My final offer is $14,000.  This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to reach a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is signaling that she's unwilling to go much lower with her ""final offer"" of $14,000.  Even though she's reduced her price, it's still significantly more than your $8,000 fallback option with John. 

At this point, continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a price you're comfortable with.  It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and buy from John at your target price."
