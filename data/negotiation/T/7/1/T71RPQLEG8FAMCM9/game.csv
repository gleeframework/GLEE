"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to make a profit, Alice, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $850000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $825000? This would leave both of us satisfied with the deal.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. How about we go with $835000? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a reasonable compromise.",835000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $835000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my last offer of $825000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do. Let's close this deal!",825000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get at least $840000 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",840000.0,Alice,7,
