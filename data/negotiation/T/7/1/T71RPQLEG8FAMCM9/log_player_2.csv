Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. How about we go with $835000? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a reasonable compromise.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get at least $840000 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $840,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $840,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $840,000 is still above your maximum budget.

Buying from John at $800,000 ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids further negotiation."
