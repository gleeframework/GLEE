"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,500 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $6,000. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better offer elsewhere.",6000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  However, $6,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $5,750.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident that we can reach an agreement.",5750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $5,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for my investment.",5800.0,Alice,5,
