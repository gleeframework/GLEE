"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $6,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still higher than what the product is worth to Bob.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $6,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $5,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 5500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's closer to his value threshold.  He's hoping to leverage his lower valuation and Alice's desire to sell to secure a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,500 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $6,000. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better offer elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered the price, it's still above what Bob is willing to pay. Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate, and Alice has shown she's willing to compromise. It's in Bob's best interest to continue negotiating to see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  However, $6,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $5,750.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident that we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 5750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is again making a counteroffer, but this time he's making a smaller jump in price. This shows Alice that he's serious about making a deal, but also that he's not willing to go too much higher.  He's hoping to find a middle ground and close the deal in the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $5,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $5,800 is within Bob's budget and is a significant improvement over the previous rounds.  It's a good compromise, and Bob is likely to get a good deal. While there's always the chance of getting a lower price, the risk of further negotiation is outweighed by the potential for reaching a deal and securing the product.  Accepting the offer avoids the possibility of Alice escalating the price or Bob losing the opportunity to buy from John."
