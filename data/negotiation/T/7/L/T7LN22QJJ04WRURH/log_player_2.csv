"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is within your budget, it's still more than you'd like to pay.  You have room to negotiate and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $120 is a bit more than I'm hoping to spend right now.  How about $100?  I'm really interested in the product, but that's my top price."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $110?  That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$110 is within your budget:** You're willing to pay up to $150, so $110 is a good deal.
* **Alice's final offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer.  Rejecting it means you risk getting no deal with her.
* **John's price is higher:** John's $150 price is significantly more expensive. 

By accepting the offer, you secure the product at a reasonable price without risking a breakdown in negotiations."
