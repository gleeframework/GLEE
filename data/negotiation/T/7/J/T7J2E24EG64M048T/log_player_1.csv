"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll love! I'm asking for $140 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly below the midpoint of our values ($120 - $150). This leaves room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit. 
* **Friendly tone:** A friendly and enthusiastic message can make Bob more receptive to my offer. 
* **Highlighting value:** Mentioning the product's value to encourage Bob to see it as a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he's interested in the product.  I can counteroffer and try to find a price we both agree on. 
* **Avoiding selling to John:** Selling to John would guarantee me $120, but I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130. This is still a great price for the product, and it gives us both a chance to make a fair deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer is halfway between my previous offer ($140) and Bob's offer ($100). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and shows good faith in the negotiation.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm still highlighting the product's value to remind Bob that $130 is a fair price considering its worth. 
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone can help keep Bob engaged and open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle on $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** Bob's offer of $115 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Risk of losing out:** If I reject his offer, there's a risk that he'll walk away or make a lower counteroffer. 
* **Time pressure:**  We're already halfway through the negotiation rounds. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and minimizes the risk of losing out on a better deal.
* **Opportunity cost:** While $120 is my minimum, the potential for a better offer in the remaining rounds is uncertain."
