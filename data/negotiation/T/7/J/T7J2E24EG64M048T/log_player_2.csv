"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll love! I'm asking for $140 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. I'm willing to negotiate to see if I can get a better price closer to Alice's perceived value of $120.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer. This gives me room to negotiate upwards while staying well below my $150 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130. This is still a great price for the product, and it gives us both a chance to make a fair deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice came down a little, but not enough. I'll keep negotiating and see if I can meet somewhere closer to the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle on $115?"",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my target."
