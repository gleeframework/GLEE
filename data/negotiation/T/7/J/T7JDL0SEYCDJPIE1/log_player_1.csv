Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and would be a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation (if Bob counters) while still securing a significant profit above John's offer.
* **Confident Presentation:**  The message positions the product's value and proposes the price with confidence, suggesting it's well-considered and justified."
