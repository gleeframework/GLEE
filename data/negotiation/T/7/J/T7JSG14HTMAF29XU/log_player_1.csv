Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,500. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We know Bob values the product at $12,000.  By offering it at $10,500, we're aiming for a price that's significantly more than our minimum ($8,000) while still leaving a potential profit margin for Bob.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Phrases like ""before I list it publicly"" create a sense of urgency and exclusivity, subtly encouraging Bob to act quickly. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $10,500, there's some wiggle room for negotiation if Bob counters."
