"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at a price that's closer to my minimum than Bob's maximum. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Friendly Tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone sets a positive foundation for the negotiation.
* **Emphasizing Value:** Highlighting the product's value for Bob encourages him to consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, he's shown interest. There's still room for negotiation, and I can use this opportunity to try and get a higher price.
* **Time is on my side:**  I have 8 more rounds to reach a mutually acceptable deal. I can use this time to carefully consider my options and try to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  This product is very valuable, and I'm confident its worth is closer to my original offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This would be a good compromise, and I'm sure you'll still find it a great deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to be flexible, but not at the cost of my own financial goals.
* **Emphasize Value:**  Again, I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive tone keeps the negotiation open and avoids creating a hostile environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, which would be $1,250,000. I think this is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's worth to me. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation room:** There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better price with a counteroffer.
* **Time is on my side:** I have 6 more rounds to reach a deal. I'm not pressured to accept Bob's offer, even if it's a decent compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm feeling more comfortable with $1,350,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while being closer to your last offer.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but consistent increase:**  Instead of jumping back to my previous offer, I'm increasing the price by a smaller amount. This shows flexibility and avoids appearing stubborn.
* **Emphasize fairness:**  I'm framing my offer as a ""fair price"" that reflects both the product's value and Bob's willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on common ground:** I'm explicitly stating the desire to find common ground, reinforcing a collaborative tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, which would be $1,325,000. I think this is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's worth to me. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Even though Bob is getting closer, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Time is running out:**  With only 4 rounds left, I need to be strategic. I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at this point, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John.
* **Potential for higher offer:**  By rejecting, I'm putting pressure on Bob. He might be willing to increase his offer further to avoid losing the deal.  

**My next offer will aim to push Bob closer to my desired price.**"

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $1,325,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Given the product's value and the time we've spent discussing this, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This represents a significant compromise from my initial position.  I hope you'll consider this my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not unreasonable:** I'm increasing the price again, but it's a smaller increment than before. This maintains pressure on Bob while showing a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Final offer:**  I'm framing this as my final offer, increasing the pressure on Bob to accept or risk losing the deal.
* **Time is ticking:**  With only 3 rounds remaining, I'm aiming for a quick resolution.

**This offer is a calculated risk.  It might push Bob to reject, but it's also possible he'll accept and I'll get a decent price.  If he rejects, I'll have to consider selling to John in the next round.**"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, which would be $1,350,000. I think this is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's worth to me. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Two Rounds Left:** With only two rounds remaining, there's not enough time to push Bob any higher. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This is a safe and secure option.
* **Potential for Lower Offer:** If I continue negotiating with Bob, there's a high chance he'll make another counteroffer that's lower than his previous offer. This could leave me with a smaller profit.

**By selling to John, I ensure a certain profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob.**"
