"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  This product is very valuable, and I'm confident its worth is closer to my original offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This would be a good compromise, and I'm sure you'll still find it a great deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, which would be $1,250,000. I think this is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's worth to me. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm feeling more comfortable with $1,350,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while being closer to your last offer.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $1,325,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Given the product's value and the time we've spent discussing this, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This represents a significant compromise from my initial position.  I hope you'll consider this my final offer.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
