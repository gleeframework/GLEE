"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product's value, $950,000 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a significant profit for you.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $875,000?  This would allow me to purchase the product while ensuring you maintain a substantial profit.",875000.0,Bob,4,
