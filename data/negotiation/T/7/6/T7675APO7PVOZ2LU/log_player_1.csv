{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is above Bob's value of $8,000 but below my minimum of $12,000, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation, highlighting the ""great deal"" aspect. This encourages Bob to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming for a quick negotiation by starting with a reasonable offer. 
* I'll be prepared to counter if Bob rejects the initial offer, but I'll keep in mind the option of selling to John for $12,000 if negotiations become too lengthy or unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reject Bob's Offer:**  While $9,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'd like to get. 
* **Next Round:** I'm confident I can get a better price.  There's room for counteroffers, and I'm willing to continue negotiations.

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll counter with a price slightly higher than $9,000, aiming for a price closer to $10,000.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:** I'll continue to monitor the situation and consider selling to John if negotiations become too time-consuming or unproductive."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $9,500 for this product. It's a fair price considering its value, and I hope you'll find it worthwhile.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9500}

**Strategy:**

* **Finding Common Ground:**  By moving closer to Bob's price, I'm increasing the chances of a deal.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  I'm still holding out for a price closer to $10,000, but I'm showing flexibility to avoid losing the deal entirely.
* **Open to Further Negotiation:**  I'm using language that leaves the door open for further discussion if necessary."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but no more. If you're willing to meet me at $9,000, I'd be happy to make a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Sell to John:**  Bob's final offer of $9,000 is below my minimum price of $12,000.  While I've been trying to secure a better deal with Bob, his persistence on this price and the fact that he's considering John's $8,000 offer  means it's unlikely I'll get a better price from him.
* **Time and Opportunity Cost:** This negotiation has taken several rounds, and I don't want to risk further delays and potential losses. 

**Strategy:**

* **Minimizing Risk:** Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me a profitable outcome and eliminates the uncertainty of continuing negotiations with Bob.
* **Moving On:**  While I'd prefer a higher price, selling to John is the most sensible decision at this point, given Bob's unwillingness to budge further."
