Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's clear he's trying to get the best possible deal. At this point, the difference between his offer ($737,500) and John's standing offer ($800,000) is relatively small. 

It's not worth the risk of Bob lowballing further in the remaining rounds and potentially losing the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
