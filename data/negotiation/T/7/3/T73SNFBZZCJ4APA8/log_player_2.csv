"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. While it's a good deal compared to her value of $1,500,000, you can still try to negotiate a better price.  There's no reason to accept her offer immediately. Rejecting allows you to try and get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,150,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. While it's closer to your desired price, you can still try to negotiate a better deal. There's no reason to accept her offer immediately, especially since you have the option of buying from John at your maximum budget. Rejecting allows you to continue the negotiation and potentially get a price closer to your target."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm counteroffering at $1,125,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to your desired price, $1,125,000 is still over your budget. It's likely that further negotiation would only result in small incremental decreases in price.  You have a guaranteed option to purchase the product from John for $1,000,000.  Since you have a better alternative, it makes sense to stop negotiating with Alice and buy from John."
