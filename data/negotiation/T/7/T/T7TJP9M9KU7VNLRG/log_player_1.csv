I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I think I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the flexibility, I still believe we can reach a better agreement closer to my valuation. I would like to propose a price of $8,200 for the product.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer of $8,200 is very close to my minimum price of $8,000. It's a good deal considering the limited rounds left and the fact that I can sell to John for $8,000. I'm going to accept his offer and close the deal."
