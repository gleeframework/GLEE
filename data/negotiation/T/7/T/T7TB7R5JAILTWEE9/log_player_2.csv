"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth at least $120 to you, so I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above the product's worth to you ($120).  You can likely get a better price by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate it. However, $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $90.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $95?  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is closer to your target price, you can still do better. You have time and negotiating leverage since you're willing to pay up to $120.  A counteroffer will keep the pressure on Alice to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $92. It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let's try to close this out."", ""product_price"": 92}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair here, but $92 is still not quite there for me. Let's meet in the middle at $93.50.  I'm confident this is a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $93.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $93.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now very close to your desired price point. While you could try to negotiate further,  the risk of her rejecting your counteroffer and the possibility of having to buy from John for $120 is too high.  Accepting the offer at $93.50 ensures you get a good deal and avoids potential complications."
