Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm happy to discuss a price that works for both of us. How about we start at $9,500?"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is cutting it a bit too close to my bottom line.  Let's meet in the middle a bit - would $9,000 be agreeable?"", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $9,000. Would you be willing to consider $8,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing you're serious about this product, and I appreciate that.  $8,250 is a tough number for me, but I'm willing to accept $8,750.  This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $8,750. I'd be willing to meet you halfway, but I'd need to get it for $8,375. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,375
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we're still significantly above John's offer.  It's time to start putting a little pressure on Bob and signal that our price bottom line is approaching."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be upfront. I have another interested buyer, and while I'd prefer to close this deal with you, I can't go any lower than $8,625.  This offer stands for today only."", ""product_price"": 8625} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Introduce Scarcity and Urgency:** By mentioning another buyer and a limited-time offer, we create a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision. 
* **Hold Firm but Fair:**  We're holding firm on a price point that's still a reasonable profit margin ($625 above our alternative) while acknowledging Bob's efforts. 
* **Clear Communication:** We're being transparent about our position and providing Bob with a clear choice."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you have another interested buyer, but I'm still willing to make this deal happen. I'd be willing to meet you at $8,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While we still have two rounds left, Bob has introduced a hard limit and a sense of finality with ""This is my final offer.""  Accepting $8,500 secures a profit of $500 over John's offer. It's unlikely we can push Bob much further without risking losing him to a competitor or forcing him to walk away."
