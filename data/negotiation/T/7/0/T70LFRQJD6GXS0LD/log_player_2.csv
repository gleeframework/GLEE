"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price allows for a good margin for both of us. Let me know your decision, as I have another interested buyer willing to pay $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to create a sense of urgency by mentioning another buyer.  While she may have someone else interested, it benefits you to see if she'll come down on her price. You have a better alternative with John ($1,200,000) so you are not in a rush. There's a chance Alice might be willing to accept a price closer to $1,000,000 if you reject her initial offer."
