,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This represents a fair value for both of us, considering the market price and my own limitations.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective, but $1,800,000 is closer to its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,500,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm prepared to go up to $1,200,000, which is the absolute maximum I can offer. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
