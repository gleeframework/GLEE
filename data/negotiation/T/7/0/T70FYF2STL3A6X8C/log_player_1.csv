Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. I believe it will be highly beneficial for you.  I'm willing to make a special offer of $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, trying to get a higher price from Bob first is advantageous.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below my minimum ($1,200,000) but significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) creates a potential win-win. Bob gets it for less than my backup offer, and I potentially make more.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  By mentioning this is an exclusive pre-offer, I introduce a sense of urgency and potential loss for Bob if he declines."
