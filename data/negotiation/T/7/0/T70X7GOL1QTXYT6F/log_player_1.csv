Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price of $1,400,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000 for your product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
