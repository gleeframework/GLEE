Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to $120 as possible since that's what John will pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still ensuring you get more than his perceived value. 
* **Direct and Clear:** The message is straightforward and avoids unnecessary complexity. 
 
**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept $119. He might counter-offer or reject it outright. However, this strategy gives you the best chance of maximizing your potential profit."
