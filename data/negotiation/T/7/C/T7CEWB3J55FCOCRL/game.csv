"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we bring it down to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $800,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking to make a profit, Alice. Let's try to find a number that works for both of us. Would you consider $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I still think the product is worth more than $950,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000 even. This is a fair offer considering the value of the product.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,000,000, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price. I'm thinking that the product's value to you is actually higher than that. I'm willing to give you a chance to meet me at $1,100,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,7,
