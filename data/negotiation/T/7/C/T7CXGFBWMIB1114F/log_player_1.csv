Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but significantly lower than my minimum ($15,000). 
* **Room for negotiation:** This price allows for some negotiation if Bob rejects, without being immediately unreasonable.
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me a strong fallback position. 

By starting high but leaving room for negotiation, I maximize my chances of getting a good price while also considering Bob's potential interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget, and it allows you to get a good return on your investment.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  I'm confident I can get a better price by making a counteroffer, possibly closer to my initial $12,000.
* **John's offer is secure:**  Having John's offer of $15,000 means I don't have to settle for a price that's significantly lower than my target. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price, without risking losing out on a much better deal with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and it would allow us to close this transaction quickly. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,000). This shows I'm willing to compromise but also maintain some leverage.
* **Highlighting the benefits:** I'm emphasizing the benefits of a quick deal, highlighting that both of us would gain from reaching an agreement. 
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $10,500 is still comfortably above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, ensuring a good profit. 

By offering a compromise and emphasizing the mutual benefits of a deal, I aim to increase the chances of Bob accepting my counteroffer while still maintaining a favorable price for myself."
