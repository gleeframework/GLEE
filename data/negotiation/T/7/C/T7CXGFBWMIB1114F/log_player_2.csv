"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a better deal than John's $8,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get the product for closer to his $8,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget, and it allows you to get a good return on your investment.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and it would allow us to close this transaction quickly. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $10,500 is less than Bob's $8,000 limit.
* **It's a better deal than John's offer:** While Bob could get the product from John for $8,000, Alice's offer is only $2,500 more. 
* **Negotiation is likely to continue:** If Bob rejects, Alice might be willing to negotiate further, but there's no guarantee that they'll come down to $8,000.

By accepting Alice's offer, Bob gets the product for a reasonable price and avoids the risk of further negotiation that could potentially lead to a higher price or a broken deal."
