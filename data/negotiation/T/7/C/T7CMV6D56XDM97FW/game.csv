"I understand you think the product is pricey, but I'm confident it's worth more to you than $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $12000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $11000, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free maintenance package worth $1000.

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting a bit too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept, but I'm still willing to negotiate.

What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the additional sweeteners, but I'm still not willing to pay $10800. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product, and I'd like to keep the maintenance package and the 2-year warranty as part of the deal. Can you consider my offer?",10500.0,Bob,10,
