"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget.  Let me know if you're open to that.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is your maximum budget, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $12,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair deal considering the value the product brings.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $12,500 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $11,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your willingness to compromise and my available funds. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",12000.0,Alice,5,
