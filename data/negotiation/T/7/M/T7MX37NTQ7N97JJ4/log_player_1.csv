"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm starting with a price of $140. This leaves some room for negotiation, but it's still a good price for me, considering I value the product at $120. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay close to my target price before potentially turning to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is better than selling to John, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him a little higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his last offer. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to close the deal, as I'm getting closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is the same as his last offer. While I'd ideally prefer more, it's been two rounds of back and forth and it's likely he won't budge further. Accepting this offer ensures I get a better price than selling to John."
