"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a price significantly below its worth to you, and I get a fair price. Let me know your thoughts!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $10,000? This would still leave you with a good profit, and I'd be happy to close the deal.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our potential deal, $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? It's still a fantastic price for you considering the product's worth to you, and it would allow me to make a decent profit. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
