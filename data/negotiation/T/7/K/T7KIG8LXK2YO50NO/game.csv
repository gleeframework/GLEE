"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This still represents a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. Can we consider that a fair price?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not quite there yet. Let's compromise at $11,500. That's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal alive.  Think about it, and let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm getting close to my limit. I'm willing to offer $10,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you meet me at this price?",10000.0,Bob,6,
