,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm not quite comfortable with $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $180 and $90, which would be $135. Would you be willing to consider that price?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $135 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $110? I'm really interested in the product and don't want to give up on it.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence! However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you halfway between $135 and $110, which would be $122.50. Would you be willing to consider that price?",122.5,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $115 yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $122.50 and $115, which would be $118.75. Would you be willing to consider that price?",118.75,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Alice, but I'm really close to my budget limit. Would you be willing to meet me at $112? I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",112.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle, Bob! However, I'm willing to make one last compromise. I'll meet you halfway between $118.75 and $112, which would be $115.375. I'll round it down to $115.38 to make it a clean number. Would you be willing to consider that price?",115.38,Alice,9,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I've reached my budget limit. I'm afraid I'll have to pass on this offer. I'll consider other options, including buying from John for $80.",80.0,Bob,10,
