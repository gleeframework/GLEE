"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $1,050,000?  This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product. Let's make this deal happen!",1050000.0,Alice,3,
