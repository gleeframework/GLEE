Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to lower the price.
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the product's value to you (Alice), the message hints at its worth by mentioning you're offering it to Bob before a public listing.
* **Leaving Room:** Offering it at $15,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially settling somewhere between $12,000 and $15,000. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, so there's no risk of losing money.

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response."
