"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to see some flexibility from your end.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects the worth of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,100,000? I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
