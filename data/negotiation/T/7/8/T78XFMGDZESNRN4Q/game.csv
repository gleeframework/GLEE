"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can we meet in the middle at $1050000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price of $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $1225000. I believe this is a more accurate reflection of the product's value, considering its unique features and benefits.",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has unique features and benefits, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1225000. I'm willing to go up to $1100000, but I'd like to see some flexibility from your end. Can we meet at $1150000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1150000. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to propose a price of $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. If you're still interested, I'm willing to discuss further, but I'd like to start at this price point.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
