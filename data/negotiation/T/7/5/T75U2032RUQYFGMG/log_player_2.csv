"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant investment for you, and I'm willing to start the conversation at a price of $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but that price is too high for me.  Would you consider $600,000?"", ""product_price"": 600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's a negotiation tactic to start significantly lower than your actual top price. This gives me room to negotiate upwards and still potentially secure a great deal. 
* **Testing the Waters:** My offer will gauge Alice's willingness to come down from her initial asking price. Her response will give me valuable information about her flexibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $900,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice came down significantly, she's still above my maximum budget, and I know I have a standing offer from John.  It's worth seeing if I can negotiate her down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit rich for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?"", ""product_price"": 750000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer aims to find a compromise that could work for both of us. It shows Alice that I'm willing to negotiate but also holds firm on getting closer to my budget.
* **Leaving Room for Maneuvering:** While this is getting close to my maximum, I'm leaving a small amount of room in case Alice is absolutely unwilling to go lower. I can then decide if it's worth going up slightly or taking John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can do a bit better than that. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **At My Limit:** Alice's final offer is still above my $800,000 maximum. There's no point in countering as she's stated it's her final offer.
* **John's Guarantee:** I have a guaranteed offer from John at my target price. There's no strategic advantage in trying to haggle with Alice any further."
