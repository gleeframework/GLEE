"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but that price is too high for me.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $900,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit rich for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can do a bit better than that. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",850000.0,Alice,5,
