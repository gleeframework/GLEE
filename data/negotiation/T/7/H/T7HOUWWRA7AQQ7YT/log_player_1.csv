Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $20,000. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm open to discussing the price if you have any concerns."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is around $8,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $20,000 represents the value of this product, I understand your budget constraints.  Could you consider $16,000? This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $16,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, Bob's offer of $12,000 is more than the minimum you'd accept ($10,000) and provides a good profit. While John offers $15,000, securing a deal now with Bob avoids the risk of further negotiation or him walking away.
