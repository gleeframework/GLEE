"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  It's a good price, but Bob can likely do better. Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, she has room to negotiate. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,000,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial price of $1,200,000. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it leaves room for both parties to find a mutually acceptable price.  Bob is taking a risk by offering a lower price, but he believes that Alice will be motivated to sell and might be willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than John's price, it's still higher than what Bob would ideally pay. There's still room for negotiation, as Alice clearly wants to sell.  By rejecting the offer, Bob keeps the possibility open for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a compromise between his previous offer of $1,000,000 and Alice's latest offer of $1,400,000. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but also willing to negotiate. It leaves room for both parties to meet in the middle and reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  At this point, Alice has come down significantly from her initial asking price, and while it's not Bob's ideal price, it's a better deal than buying from John.  Continuing to negotiate risks the possibility of Alice getting frustrated and walking away, or even raising her price again.  It's a good deal for Bob, and he should take it."
