"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85.  How about we split the difference?",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $85 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $75 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",75.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $75 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to go down to $82.  It's a fair price for both of us.",82.0,Alice,5,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still think $82 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $78 for the product. Can you consider that?",78.0,Bob,6,
