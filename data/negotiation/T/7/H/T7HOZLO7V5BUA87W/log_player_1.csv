Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price, but it still leaves me with a good profit. It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter-offer. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll see what his counter-offer is and decide if it's worth continuing negotiations or if I should just go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still not ideal.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $950,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his last offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still trying to secure a good profit.  If Bob rejects, I'll have to assess if it's worth continuing or if I'm better off with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum acceptable price and continuing to negotiate might be a waste of time.  It's better to secure a sale now than risk losing Bob and having to accept John's offer later."
