"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering our product! I'm excited to make you an offer. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,200,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget of $800,000.  It's a good starting point to see where Alice is willing to go.  You can definitely do better than $1,200,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $850,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,050,000.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $925,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm offering the product to you for $930,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $930,000 is still higher than your target of $800,000.  You've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's getting close to the end.  While you could try to make another counteroffer, it's unlikely that Alice will come down much further, and you risk the possibility of not getting the product at all. It's more likely that you'll get the product from John at the price you want.  Buying from John guarantees you the product at your desired price, and it's the most sensible choice at this point in the negotiation."
