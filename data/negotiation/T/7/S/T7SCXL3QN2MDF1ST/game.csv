"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's worth a lot to both of us, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price.  My starting offer is $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $900,000 is a little steep for me. How about we settle on something closer to $700,000? ",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $700,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $850,000? This still allows for a good profit for both of us. ",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $775,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $800,000.  Let's try $825,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,
