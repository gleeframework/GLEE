Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm looking for $150 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Showing enthusiasm:** I'm using a friendly and enthusiastic tone to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Asking for feedback:**  I'm inviting Bob to respond and potentially make a counteroffer.

This strategy allows me to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  His response will give me a sense of his perceived value of the product. 
* **Maximize potential profit:** Starting high gives me more room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Keep the door open to John:** If Bob rejects my initial offer, I can still sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still above my minimum acceptable price ($100), but it's lower than my initial ask. I'm not in a rush to sell, and I believe I can potentially get closer to my desired price. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can:

* **Show that I'm not desperate:**  Rejecting his offer demonstrates that I'm not willing to settle for just any price. 
* **Continue the negotiation:**  I can make a counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Maintain leverage:**  If I reject Bob's offer, I can still sell to John for $100 if the negotiations with Bob break down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $135. This still reflects the value of the product, and I think it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by lowering my price from the initial $150 to $135. 
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm still emphasizing the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and respectful, while still communicating my firm stance. 

By offering $135, I'm trying to:

* **Find a middle ground:** I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my desired price but still acceptable to Bob.
* **Signal my willingness to negotiate:** I'm showing that I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. 
* **Keep the negotiations moving:** I want to avoid a stalemate and continue to work towards a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is $125, which is only $5 away from my initial minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, it's getting late in the negotiation, and:

* **The risk of rejection is high:**  Bob has already rejected multiple offers.  There's a good chance he won't budge further.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Even if I reject Bob's offer, I can still sell to John for $100.
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing to negotiate might take more time, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer.

Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a sale at a price that's close to my minimum, and it avoids the risk of losing the deal completely."
