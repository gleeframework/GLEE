"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a price of $20000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you is $8000, and I'm willing to make a deal with you today.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20000 is way above my budget. I'm only willing to pay $8000 for the product, which is its true value to me.  Let me know if you're interested in making a deal at that price.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a deal, Bob, but $8000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12000 is still higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm prepared to pay $9000, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $9000, Bob. I think the product's value to you is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $9000, so I'll offer it to you for $10500. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's a good deal.",10500.0,Alice,5,
