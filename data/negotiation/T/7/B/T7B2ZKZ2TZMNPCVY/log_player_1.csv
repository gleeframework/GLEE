"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I can come down to $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Could we agree on $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly willing to go above $1,000,000, and we still have plenty of rounds to negotiate. Accepting his offer now would leave money on the table. We're better off countering again and trying to close the gap."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we are getting closer.  How about $1,012,000 and we close this out? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,012,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,012,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has crossed the $1,000,000 threshold, and while there's still room for negotiation, the potential gains are shrinking. Accepting his offer of $1,012,000 guarantees a profit above John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer in subsequent rounds."
