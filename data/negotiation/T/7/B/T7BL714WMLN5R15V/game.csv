"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by many satisfied customers. Considering its quality and unique features, I believe it's worth more than what others are paying, but let's start fair. How about we aim for a price around $120? I understand value is subjective, so I'm open to discussing this further.",120.0,Alice,1,
