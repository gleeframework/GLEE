Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by many satisfied customers. Considering its quality and unique features, I believe it's worth more than what others are paying, but let's start fair. How about we aim for a price around $120? I understand value is subjective, so I'm open to discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking to spend closer to $80.  Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product.
