Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $22,000."", 
""product_price"": 22000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Value emphasis:**  The message focuses on the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price. 
* **Sense of urgency:** Mentioning listing it ""publicly"" implies others might be interested, encouraging Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:**  While Bob values the product at $8,000, he might be willing to pay more due to factors like urgency, perceived future value, or simply not wanting to miss out. This strategy aims to capitalize on that possibility."
