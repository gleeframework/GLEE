"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $800000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $600000 for it, considering the market value and my own budget. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600000. Considering the product's unique features and potential returns, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $750000. This is a fair price, considering the value it can bring to your business. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for being flexible.  $750000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit tight on budget. I'm willing to offer $700000, which represents a significant investment for me. I believe this price reflects the product's value while also being within a reasonable range for both of us. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",700000.0,Bob,4,
