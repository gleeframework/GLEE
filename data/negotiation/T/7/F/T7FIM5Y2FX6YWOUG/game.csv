,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but $750000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $825000. This is a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $825000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $775000. Can you consider that?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're still interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $775000. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at that price yet.

"I understand you're still interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $785000. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at that price yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $820000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair deal considering the product's value. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",820000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable meeting you at $795000. I'm willing to make one last concession, so I'm counteroffering at $815000. This is my absolute final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're not interested, I'll have to consider other options.",815000.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $815000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any higher.
