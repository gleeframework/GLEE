"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's worth a lot to both of us, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm starting with $900,000, but I'm open to negotiation."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  By starting at $900,000, I'm aiming for a higher initial profit while leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Show Willingness to Negotiate:** Emphasizing my openness to negotiation indicates flexibility and encourages Bob to counteroffer.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** Highlighting the value to both parties creates a positive tone and fosters cooperation. 

**Strategy:** I'm aiming for a quick deal, but if Bob rejects my offer, I'll be ready to counter based on his response and adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being open to negotiation. However, $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $750,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob's willingness to negotiate, along with his counteroffer, indicates that we can find a middle ground. 
* **Time for a counteroffer:** By rejecting his offer and providing a counteroffer, I aim to move the price closer to my desired range.

**Strategy:** I'll be using this round to gauge Bob's flexibility and make a calculated counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $750,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering the product for $825,000. This is a fair price that considers both of our needs."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint Counter:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my minimum ($800,000) and Bob's offer ($750,000). This shows that I'm willing to compromise while still protecting my profit.
* **Emphasize Fairness:**  Highlighting the ""fairness"" of the price helps Bob perceive it as reasonable and encourages him to accept.
* **Strong but Flexible Tone:** I'm remaining firm in my stance, but the message also emphasizes my willingness to reach an agreement.

**Strategy:**

* **Goal:** Aim for a quick deal within a few rounds. 
* **Flexibility:**  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to adjust my counteroffer again, but I won't go below $800,000.
* **John as Safety Net:** I'm aware of the option to sell to John for $800,000, which acts as a fallback if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $825,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $800,000.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is at my minimum:**  Bob has offered my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Time is a factor:**  We're already four rounds in, and I don't want to risk losing time with further negotiations.
* **No incentive for counteroffer:**  There's no benefit in rejecting Bob's offer and continuing negotiations, as I won't be able to get a higher price.

**Strategy:**

* **Accept and move on:**  Accepting Bob's offer secures the minimum profit I was aiming for, and I can move on to other business opportunities.
* **John's offer is redundant:**  Since Bob's offer meets my minimum, there's no need to consider selling to John, as the profit is the same."
