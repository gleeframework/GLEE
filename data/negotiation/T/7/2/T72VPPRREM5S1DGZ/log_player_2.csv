"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's worth a lot to both of us, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm starting with $900,000, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's opening offer is too high.  As Bob, I want to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being open to negotiation. However, $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $750,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering the product for $825,000. This is a fair price that considers both of our needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my target. I'm not willing to pay more than $800,000. Rejecting the offer allows me to counter again and hopefully reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $825,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $800,000.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}
