"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and optimistic, hoping to build rapport.
* **Focus on Value:**  I emphasize the ""great deal"" aspect to appeal to Bob's interests. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  $1,100,000 is above my minimum ($1,200,000), but leaves space for potential counteroffers.

This first offer is strategic, aiming to get the ball rolling while still keeping my options open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum than his previous offer, it still falls below my absolute minimum of $1,200,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I still have 9 rounds left, and I believe there's room for further negotiations. 
* **Building Leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm demonstrating my willingness to walk away and potentially pushing Bob to offer a higher price. 

I'm choosing to reject the offer to try to achieve a better outcome, but I'm aware that I'm losing some time and risk Bob walking away entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 isn't quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still staying above my minimum. 
* **Maintaining Value:**  I'm highlighting the product's value to justify my price point. 
* **Urgency and Optimism:**  I use phrases like ""Let's close this deal!"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while maintaining a price that's acceptable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,150,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer, while an increase, is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:**  We're making progress, but I believe there's still room for Bob to increase his offer further.
* **Time is a Factor:**  While I could accept and get a deal, I have more rounds available and I'm not yet under significant pressure.

I'm choosing to reject the offer and continue negotiating. My hope is that by rejecting the offer, I can push Bob to offer a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still too far from where we need to be.  Given the value of the product and the time we've invested in this discussion, I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:**  I'm again offering a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a price above my minimum. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while ensuring I don't undervalue the product. 
* **Emphasizing Value and Time:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and the time we've already spent negotiating. This subtly increases pressure on him to close the deal. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains positive and encouraging, urging Bob to accept the offer.

This counteroffer aims to find a balance between getting a good price and closing the deal before time runs out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm trying to be fair. However,  $1,125,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000,  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  
* **Time Pressure:** We are halfway through the rounds, and time is running out.  
* **Potential for Counteroffers:** While I could reject and try for a higher price, there's a risk that Bob will walk away or his next offer could be lower.

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and prevents the risk of losing the deal altogether.  While I'm not getting my ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise given the circumstances."
