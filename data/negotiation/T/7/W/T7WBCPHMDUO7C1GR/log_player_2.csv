It's always worth exploring options, especially since you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  Let's see if we can get a better deal from Alice."

```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 isn't quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

Alice is still too high, and I'm still confident I can get a better price.  Let's counter again."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,150,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still too far from where we need to be.  Given the value of the product and the time we've invested in this discussion, I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
