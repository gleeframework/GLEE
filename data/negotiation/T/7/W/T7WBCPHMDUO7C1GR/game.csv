"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 isn't quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal!",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,150,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000.  Let's meet in the middle.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still too far from where we need to be.  Given the value of the product and the time we've invested in this discussion, I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's make this happen!",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm trying to be fair. However,  $1,125,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000,  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
