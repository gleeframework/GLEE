"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,000,000. This is a fair deal, as it's worth the same amount to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

While Alice claims the product is worth $1,000,000 to you, you know you can get it for that price from John.  There's no reason to accept Alice's offer when there's a chance she might go lower. By rejecting, you open the door for a potential counter-offer."
