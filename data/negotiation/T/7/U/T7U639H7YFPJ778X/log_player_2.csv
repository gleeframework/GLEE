# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale. I think you'll find it very valuable. I'm asking for $115. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. You can likely get a better price than $115."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest.  I could come down a bit, but $105 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

You can still try to get a better price from Alice.  While $110 is a bit better than her original offer, you're still not at your desired price point."
