"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its true value. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my needs and your desired sale. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  I'm confident I can get a better deal with Bob or potentially get my full value from John.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and explore other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still quite a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a substantial compromise on my part.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  Let's try to find common ground here.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still not enough.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, as there's still a chance we can reach an agreement closer to my desired price. It's also worth noting that the rounds are limited, and selling to John for $1,200,000 remains a viable option if the negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're willing to compromise, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $925,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiations. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 925000}
