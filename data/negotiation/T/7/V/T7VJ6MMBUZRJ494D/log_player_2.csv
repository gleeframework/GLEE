"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its true value. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,000,000 is a good deal considering the product's true value, it's still above Bob's budget.  It's worth exploring further negotiation with Alice to see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my needs and your desired sale. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still quite a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a substantial compromise on my part.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still above Bob's budget.  Bob can likely negotiate a lower price, particularly since he has the option to buy from John for $800,000.  It's worth continuing the negotiation with Alice to see if a mutually agreeable price can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  Let's try to find common ground here. "", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're willing to compromise, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $925,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiations. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is close to Bob's budget and represents a good compromise considering the value of the product and the ongoing negotiation. While Bob could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk of Alice rejecting any further counteroffers, especially with only five rounds remaining.  Accepting the offer secures the product for Bob at a reasonable price, minimizing the risk of losing the deal altogether."
