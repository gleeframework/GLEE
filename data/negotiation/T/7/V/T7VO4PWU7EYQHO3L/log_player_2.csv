Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're still in the negotiation, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go up to $11,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $12,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to cut bait.  Alice is very unlikely to go below $12,500 and at this point, it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation. John offers a guaranteed price of $12,000 which is better than Alice's current offer."
