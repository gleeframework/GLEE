"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000, which I believe is a fair and reasonable offer considering its value to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I understand the value of the product but $18,000 is quite high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm afraid $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $14,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value you'll get from it.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we split the difference again and settle on $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $13,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value you'll get from it.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we make this our final offer - $11,500.  It's a fair price and allows us both to benefit.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're still in the negotiation, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go up to $11,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $12,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from it.",12500.0,Alice,7,
