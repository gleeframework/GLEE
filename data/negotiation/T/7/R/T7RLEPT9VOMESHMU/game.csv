"Alice, your product is certainly appealing, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $850,000. This seems like a fair price, considering the value you've placed on it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  However, the value this product brings to the table is substantial, and I'm confident it can significantly benefit your operations. I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000. I believe this price point reflects its true worth while acknowledging your feedback. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  This price reflects the product's value while allowing for a reasonable profit margin for you.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
