"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is better than $1,000,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, your product is certainly appealing, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $850,000. This seems like a fair price, considering the value you've placed on it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  However, the value this product brings to the table is substantial, and I'm confident it can significantly benefit your operations. I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000. I believe this price point reflects its true worth while acknowledging your feedback. What do you think?

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $925,000 is closer to his ideal price, there's still room for further negotiation. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation alive and gives Bob another opportunity to get a lower price."
