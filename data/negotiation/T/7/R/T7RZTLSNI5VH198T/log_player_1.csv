Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing he values the product at $12,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $11,500 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting you closer to his maximum valuation.
* **Secure a Good Deal:** Even if Bob doesn't negotiate, $11,500 is significantly more than your guaranteed $10,000 from John.

This strategy balances ambition with a high probability of a successful sale."
