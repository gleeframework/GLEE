Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential. To move this forward, I'm proposing $1,275,000. This allows both of us to benefit from the deal."",
""product_price"": 1275000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am still constrained by my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,250,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I could push for a higher price, accepting $1,250,000 is a substantial profit. Continuing to negotiate risks Bob lowering his offer or walking away.  It's better to secure a strong deal now than risk losing him as a buyer."
