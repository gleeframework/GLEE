"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, but also shows Bob that I believe the product is valuable. I'm not sure what the product is or what it's worth to Bob, so I'm taking a calculated risk to see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's my minimum value, I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $13,500.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe the product is worth more than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be enough to entice Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take the $11,500, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I know John will pay $12,000, and I think I can still get Bob to go higher.  I'm not sure how many rounds are left, but I want to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $12,500.  This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, but I think it's a fair compromise given the remaining rounds. I'm hoping that this will be enough to get Bob to close the deal.  We're both getting closer to a win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John. While I could continue to negotiate with Bob, the time is running out.  I've already rejected his last offer, and I'm not confident I can get him to go higher.  I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed sale to John, especially when I know I can get my minimum value."
