"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it at $2,200,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is way too high. I'm not willing to pay more than $800,000 for this product. I understand it's valuable to you, but it's simply not worth that much to me. Let's start with this price and see if we can find some common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below what I can accept for this product. It offers a lot of unique value that might not be immediately apparent. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it represents a fair offer considering its potential.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000 for this product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in it.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually agreeable price. To be frank, $1,000,000 is still a tough pill to swallow for a product of this caliber.  I'm willing to consider $1,700,000. I believe this reflects its real value while acknowledging your constraints.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,700,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000 for this product. This is a significant increase from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering its potential and my financial constraints. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a deal. I've considered carefully, and to be completely transparent, I have another buyer ready at $1,500,000.  However, I value our discussions and believe we can still find an agreement. My final offer is $1,600,000.",1600000.0,Alice,7,
