Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is way too high. I'm not willing to pay more than $800,000 for this product. I understand it's valuable to you, but it's simply not worth that much to me. Let's start with this price and see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below what I can accept for this product. It offers a lot of unique value that might not be immediately apparent. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it represents a fair offer considering its potential.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually agreeable price. To be frank, $1,000,000 is still a tough pill to swallow for a product of this caliber.  I'm willing to consider $1,700,000. I believe this reflects its real value while acknowledging your constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000.
