"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you, and I'm willing to come down from my minimum asking price.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering its value and my budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $900,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and allows me to get closer to my asking price. Let's see if we can make this work.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $900,000 is still a bit outside my budget. How about we settle at $700,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $700,000 is still significantly below what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering it's still a great deal for you and allows me to move closer to my desired price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,5,
