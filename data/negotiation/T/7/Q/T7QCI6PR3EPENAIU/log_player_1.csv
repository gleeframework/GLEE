Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This is a starting point.  I'm offering a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play in this price range. 

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is a good price, I believe I can get closer to my desired price range. I'm going to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still well above Bob's offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground and close the deal without having to go back and forth too much more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still a bit lower than I was hoping for, it's a good price and getting closer to my desired range. I'm also not sure if we'll get a better price in future rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
