{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is above your maximum price of $8,000.
* It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price, aiming to create room for negotiation.
* $7,500 is a reasonable starting point, as it's still below my maximum price and leaves some room for compromise."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* While Alice's offer is closer to my maximum price, it's still above my target. 
* I believe there's still room for negotiation and I can potentially get a better price by rejecting and counteroffering again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm now offering my maximum price of $8,000.
* This demonstrates my seriousness in purchasing the product while staying within my budget.
*  If Alice rejects this offer, I will be forced to purchase from John at the same price, so there is no further negotiation possible."
