Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,000. This gives me a good starting point to negotiate, and it's still a reasonable price for Bob considering the product is worth $8,000 to him. I'm hoping he'll accept, but if not, I'm prepared to counteroffer or even sell to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I want for the product.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $8,500. This is a compromise that's closer to my desired price of $9,000, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable price considering he's already offered $7,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and it's the same price I could get from John.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate, so I'll accept Bob's offer."
