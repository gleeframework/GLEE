"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Beginning with a strong offer ($1,300,000) aims to anchor the negotiation closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000).  
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  This initial price allows for flexibility to decrease during the negotiation while still staying well above Alice's minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and invites Bob's perspective, fostering a collaborative tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. It's a fair price given its value and your asking price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a substantial amount, it's still considerably lower than his perceived value of $1,500,000.  Alice has room to negotiate and aim for a higher price. Accepting $800,000 from John would be leaving a significant amount of potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $1,000,000 is certainly a respectable figure, it doesn't quite reflect the true value this product brings. I'm confident it can significantly impact your operations, potentially exceeding even your own initial valuation.  Would you be willing to consider $1,175,000? "", 
""product_price"": 1175000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** This counteroffer meets Bob a bit above the middle ground between his offer ($1,000,000) and Alice's previous ask ($1,300,000). This shows flexibility while still pursuing a strong price.
* **Reiterating Value:**  The message gently reminds Bob of the product's potential to exceed his expectations, subtly justifying the higher price point.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  Asking ""Would you be willing to consider..."" encourages Bob to engage in further discussion rather than simply saying yes or no."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your point about the product's potential, but I still think $1,175,000 is too high.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a significant investment for me, and I need to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit Margin:** $1,100,000 is a significant profit for Alice, well above her minimum acceptable price and a substantial gain over John's offer.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating his strong interest in the product. Accepting now avoids the risk of him reducing his offer or stalling negotiations.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal sooner allows Alice to reinvest the capital or utilize it for other opportunities."
