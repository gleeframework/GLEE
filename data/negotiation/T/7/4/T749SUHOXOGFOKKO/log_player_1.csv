Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth at least $120, but I'm willing to part with it for $135. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a price slightly above Bob's perceived value:**  Since Bob values the product at $120, offering it slightly higher at $135 gives him a chance to feel like he's getting a ""deal"" if he can negotiate the price down a bit. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The message hints at negotiation by saying ""willing to part with it for,"" implying the price isn't completely fixed. 
* **Creating a sense of urgency:** By mentioning you'll list it publicly, you subtly pressure Bob to act quickly if he's interested.

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while still keeping the price attractive enough that Bob might consider accepting."
