"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($150) but lower than what I could potentially get from John ($150). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and positive message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider my offer. 
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for my price (value of the product), which can make it seem more reasonable. 

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to start high and see if I can secure a good price.  If Bob rejects, I'll have to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe I can offer you $120 for the product. I hope this aligns better with its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** While John offers a guaranteed $150, I can still potentially get a better price from Bob. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product, and there's room for a counteroffer that could be more profitable than selling to John.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'll need to be careful not to drive Bob away completely, but I also need to ensure I'm not giving away too much value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140 for the product. This is a fair compromise, considering its value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Justification:**  I'm still justifying my price by mentioning the value of the product, making it seem more reasonable.
* **Fairness:** I'm using the word ""compromise"" to make my counteroffer appear like a mutually beneficial solution. 

**Strategy:**

I'm attempting to meet Bob halfway, but still staying above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal, especially considering the possibility of him walking away and going to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my valuation of the product, I would like to propose a price of $130. I hope this is within the range you're considering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $130 is only $20 less than my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** If I reject his offer and counter again, there's a chance he'll walk away, leaving me with no sale.
* **Time is Running Out:**  We're already in round 4, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower offer later on.

**Strategy:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, I'm accepting Bob's offer to secure a sale and avoid the risk of ending up with nothing.  I'm also considering the fact that I'm closer to my minimum acceptable price than I was with previous offers."
