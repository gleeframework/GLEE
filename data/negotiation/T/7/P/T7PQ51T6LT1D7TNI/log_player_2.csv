"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer. He has a clear goal of saving as much money as possible and buying the product for less than $1,000,000. Alice's offer is already above his desired price.  There's still room for negotiation and potentially a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's first counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, demonstrating his serious intent to negotiate and potentially find a mutually agreeable price. Starting with a lower price point gives him more room for negotiation in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still willing to negotiate further. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer. While it's closer to his desired price, it's still above his budget. He has 7 more rounds to negotiate, and there's a chance he can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. I believe we can find a mutually agreeable price if we continue to work together."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, showing Alice he is serious about negotiating. He's still below his $1,000,000 ""walk away"" price, giving him room for more negotiation. This incremental approach keeps the negotiation moving forward without risking a breakdown."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,025,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This is a reasonable price considering the product's value to me and the value you've placed on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is still above Bob's desired price of $1,000,000. While he could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee that he'll be able to get a better deal in the remaining 5 rounds.  Since he has the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, it's the most financially sensible decision to take that option.  He's not going to get a better price than $1,000,000, so there's no point in risking further negotiation."
