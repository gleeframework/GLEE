Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $13,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000, but still leaves me with a profit. It's a reasonable starting point, and if he rejects, I can always counter-offer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is more than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not ready to accept such a low price.  I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000.  This is a further compromise from my previous offer, but it's still a fair price considering my minimum acceptable value.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to convince Bob to buy the product, as I'm getting closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is simply too low for me to consider. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to settle for such a significant loss.  I'll sell the product to John for $15,000, ensuring I get my desired price and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
