The offer is too high.  It's better to try and negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

I'm starting with a fairly low counteroffer to see where Alice stands.  I'm confident that I can get a better deal than $950,000, and this price leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is still too high. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price before I consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm hoping Alice will recognize that I'm serious about buying the product and be willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, I still believe I can do better.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer before I seriously consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

This is my final offer.  I'm willing to pay John $800,000, so this is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay for the product.  I'm hoping Alice will recognize that I'm serious about buying the product and accept my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is clearly not willing to go lower than $815,000. While this is close to my budget, it's still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  At this point, I'm better off buying the product from John for $800,000.  It's not the ideal price, but it's the best I can do."
