"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product to you today. I think it would be a great fit for your needs. I'm asking for $22,000 to start the negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $22,000 is far above his budget, and he can always buy from John for $10,000.  It's better to negotiate with Alice to see if she's willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10,000. Let's start with $12,000 and see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. While $22,000 might have been a high starting point, $12,000 undervalues the true worth of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $18,000 is closer to his budget, he still has room to negotiate and can likely get a lower price. It's worth trying to get closer to his desired $10,000 price point before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $15,000?  It's a fair compromise and closer to my budget."", ""product_price"": 15000}
