,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10,000. Let's start with $12,000 and see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. While $22,000 might have been a high starting point, $12,000 undervalues the true worth of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $15,000?  It's a fair compromise and closer to my budget.",15000.0,Bob,4,
