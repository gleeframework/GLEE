"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $90.",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $75. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",75.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for getting back to me, Alice. I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $75 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $68? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",68.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $68 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $72. It's a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the product!",72.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, you drive a hard bargain! I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $70, but I can't go any higher than that. What do you say?",70.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but $70 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $74. It's a great price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",74.0,Alice,7,
