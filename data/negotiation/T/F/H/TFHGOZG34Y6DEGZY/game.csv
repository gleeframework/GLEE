"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I'm confident that it will exceed your expectations and prove to be a wise investment for you.",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, it's higher than I'm able to go at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 falls quite a bit short of what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value this product will bring you.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let's work together to finalize the deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
