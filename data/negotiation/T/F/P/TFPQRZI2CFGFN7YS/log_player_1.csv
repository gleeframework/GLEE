Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}

This is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but it also leaves room for negotiation.  It's likely Bob will counteroffer, allowing us to find a price that's mutually beneficial.  If Bob rejects, I'll assess the situation and potentially make a new offer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is better than selling to John, I believe we can do better. Bob's counteroffer is still significantly lower than my initial offer, so I'll reject it and make a counteroffer of my own in the next round.  I want to see if I can bridge the gap and reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $11,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I still believe the product is worth more than $10,000.  Hopefully, this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and we can reach a final agreement."
