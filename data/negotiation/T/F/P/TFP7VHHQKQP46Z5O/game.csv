"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I can afford. How about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. This product has incredible potential and will bring you a substantial return on your investment. How about we meet halfway? I can offer it to you for $1,125,000.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I still feel that $950,000 was too high. I've done some research and found that similar products are being sold for around $875,000. Would you consider $875,000 for this product?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best deal, but comparing this product to others at $875,000 is like comparing a thoroughbred to a donkey. This product offers unique advantages and value that others simply can't match. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This is my final offer, Bob.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your persistence and the value of the product, but I still believe that $875,000 is a fair price considering the market trends and comparable products. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,6,
