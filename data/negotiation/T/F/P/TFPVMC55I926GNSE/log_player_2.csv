"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I'm willing to start at a price of $18,000, which is a fair price considering its worth to you is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above my maximum budget of $12,000. It's not even close to a fair price considering my valuation. It's best to reject and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $18,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $15,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I'm confident it's still a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum limit. I'm determined to get the product for as close to $12,000 as possible, so I'll reject and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,000 is still above what I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, which is a reasonable compromise considering the value of the product to me. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $14,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still above my comfort zone. While it is closer to my ideal price of $12,000, I'm still willing to risk rejecting this offer to see if I can get it lower. I'm confident that I can make a counteroffer and still have a chance of getting the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,500, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me.  Let's close this deal and avoid going any further."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing out. I'll meet you at $14,000, but I need you to meet me halfway on the last offer. I'll give you a slight discount, and I'll sell the product to you for $13,750. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $13,750 is still above my desired price range. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, I've reached a point where it's more advantageous to simply purchase from John for $12,000.  There's a good chance I won't be able to get a better price from Alice, and I'm running out of time.  It's time to secure the product and avoid further potential complications."
