"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,600,000. I'm confident this will be a worthwhile investment for you.",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,600,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
