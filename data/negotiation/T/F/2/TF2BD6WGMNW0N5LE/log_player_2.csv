"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth at least $10000 to me, and I know you'd find it equally valuable. I'm offering it to you for $10500. This is a great deal, as you're getting it for a bit more than what it's worth to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

You are willing to pay up to $10,000.  Alice's offer is $10,500, which is more than you're willing to pay. You can get the product for $10,000 from John, so it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer."
