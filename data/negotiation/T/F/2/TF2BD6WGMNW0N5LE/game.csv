"Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth at least $10000 to me, and I know you'd find it equally valuable. I'm offering it to you for $10500. This is a great deal, as you're getting it for a bit more than what it's worth to me. Let me know what you think!",10500.0,Alice,1,
