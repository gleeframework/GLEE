"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $10,000 to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  Considering my budget and the value I place on the product, I'd be willing to pay $12,000.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is still a great deal, considering its worth $10,000 to you, and I'm confident you'll find it's a valuable addition to your portfolio.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $14,000 is still a bit outside my budget. Let's meet in the middle. I'm ready to offer $13,000.  This feels like a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that we're close to reaching an agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",13500.0,Alice,5,
