"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. My initial offer for the product is $1300000. I am confident this price reflects its true value and provides you with a significant return on investment. Let me know if you're interested in discussing further details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is slightly higher than my budget allows. To make this deal work, I'd be willing to pay $1,150,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product while remaining within my financial constraints. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose a compromise. How about we set the price at $1250000? This still reflects the product's value while being more accessible to your budget. I'm looking forward to your thoughts on this proposal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his preferred price point. Bob has already made a counteroffer and shown his willingness to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and potentially allows for a lower price in future rounds."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $1,200,000. This price is fair, reflects the value of the product, and allows us to reach an agreement. I'm confident we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
