Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob.  This allows for some negotiation room while still giving me a good profit.  Let's see if he's willing to pay a premium!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price and less than I could get from John. I'm willing to try and negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering a price of $105, which is still above my minimum price and is a good compromise.  It's a significant increase from Bob's offer, but still lower than my initial offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for a price too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $100. 

While Bob's offer of $95 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not ideal.  John is willing to pay my minimum price, and I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob, especially if it means possibly getting a lower price or having to make another counteroffer. It's better to take the guaranteed $100 from John and move on."
