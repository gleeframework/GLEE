"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $1000000 to you. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for the product. Alice is offering it for $1,100,000. This is more than your maximum price. You can get the same product from John for $1,000,000, so rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John saves you $100,000."
