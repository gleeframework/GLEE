"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8000.  Let me know if that's something you're willing to work with.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $8000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. Would you be interested in paying $12000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know your thoughts.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $10000. This would allow both of us to get a fair deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to keep working with you.  $10000 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to go to $11000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal.  Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",11000.0,Alice,5,
