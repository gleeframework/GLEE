"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2000000.  It's a truly unique opportunity with incredible potential. I believe this price is fair given the value of the product. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $2,000,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  There's room for negotiation."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1200000 is simply too low for me.  Given the value and potential of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,750,000 is closer to his budget, it's still higher than his maximum of $1,200,000. There's still room for negotiation, and he can try to bring the price down further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,750,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I believe this is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1400000 still falls short of my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1600000 as a final compromise. This price reflects the true value of the product, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. Let's finalize this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John for $1,200,000. 

Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget, and it's likely that continued negotiation will not result in a price lower than $1,200,000.  John's offer is the best option for Bob at this point, as it allows him to acquire the product within his budget."
