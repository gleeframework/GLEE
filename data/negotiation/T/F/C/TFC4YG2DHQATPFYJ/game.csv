"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $10000 is just a bit too low for me.  Given the value of this product, I'm prepared to go down to $12000.  That would still leave a fair margin for both of us. Let's keep talking!",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking $11000 is a fair price. Can you consider that?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While I'm willing to work with you, $11000 is still a little low for me.  However, I'm committed to reaching a fair deal. How about $11500? That's a good compromise, and it reflects the true value of the product. Let's see if we can close this out!",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $11500 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to go up to $11000, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price?",11000.0,Bob,6,
