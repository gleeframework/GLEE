"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting a fantastic product at a price significantly lower than its value to you. I'm confident this is a win-win situation. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm open to negotiating, $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which still leaves room for you to make a substantial profit.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? That seems like a fair compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
