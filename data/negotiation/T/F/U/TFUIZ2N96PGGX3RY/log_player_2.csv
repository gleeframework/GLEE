"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. While it's lower than her own valuation, it's still above my maximum. I want to try to negotiate a better price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still above my absolute maximum. This shows that I'm serious about negotiating but also that I'm willing to walk away if the price isn't right. I'm leaving room for further negotiation, hopefully reaching a price somewhere between $1,050,000 and $1,200,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as 1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer 1100000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my target, it's still slightly higher than I'm comfortable paying. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to push for a lower price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,100,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,075,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it's closer to what I can afford.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking to my strategy of offering a price slightly lower than Alice's counteroffer.  This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to get the best price. $1,075,000 is a good middle ground between my last offer and Alice's current one.  I'm hopeful that Alice will accept, but I'm also prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as 1075000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer 1090000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,090,000 is getting very close to my maximum budget. While I would prefer to pay less, it's only $90,000 above my maximum.  I'm confident that continuing to negotiate won't likely get me much further, and I risk Alice walking away entirely.  It's also likely that John will raise his price if I delay too long.  Therefore, I'm willing to accept Alice's offer to secure the product at a price that's still within my acceptable range."
