"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1050000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as 1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer 1100000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1100000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1075000.  This is a fair compromise, and it's closer to what I can afford.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to go as low as 1075000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer 1090000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
