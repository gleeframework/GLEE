"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. I'm open to negotiation, but I'm confident you'll find this a fair deal.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value and allows both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately below my minimum threshold.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,250,000.  This price still allows for a profitable deal for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as I'm prepared to purchase the product from John for that amount if we can't reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
