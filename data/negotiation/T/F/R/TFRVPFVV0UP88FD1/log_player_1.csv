Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $20,000. I believe it offers significant value, and I'm happy to answer any questions you may have."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $15,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob's offer is tempting, I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price. It makes the most financial sense to proceed with John to avoid further negotiation and potential loss."
