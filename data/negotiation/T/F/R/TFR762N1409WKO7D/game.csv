"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me.  How about $75?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your interest!  While $75 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $85?  That's a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $85 is still a bit higher than my budget.  How about $80?  That's my absolute limit, but I think it's fair considering the product is worth that to me.",80.0,Bob,4,
