{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking for $150 for it.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll love it! What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This initial offer is a bit higher than the minimum I'd accept, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested. It also includes a positive message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than $100, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $150.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $120 is still a little low for me.  How about $135?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate it. Would it be possible for us to agree on $130? This would allow us to stay closer to my budget while still compensating you fairly for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $130 is a good price, and it's closer to my target than selling to John for $100.  It's also a good compromise that shows I'm willing to work with Bob to reach a mutually acceptable deal."
