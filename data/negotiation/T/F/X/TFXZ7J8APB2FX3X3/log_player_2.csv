You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly motivated to sell as the product is worth less to her ($1,000,000) than her asking price ($1,250,000). 
* While John's price is higher ($1,500,000), there's room for negotiation with Alice. 
* By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're serious but find her initial price too high. This opens the door for a counter-offer closer to your desired range."
