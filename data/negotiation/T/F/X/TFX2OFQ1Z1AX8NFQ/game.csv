"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm not willing to pay $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $1,000,000 to you.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,050,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know if you're interested in this compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll offer $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $1,000,000 to you.",950000.0,Bob,4,
