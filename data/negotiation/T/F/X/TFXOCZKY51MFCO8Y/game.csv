"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $70 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $75? It's a fair price for both of us.",75.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm happy to keep talking.  $72 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $74?  It's a fair price, and we can both be happy with the deal.",74.0,Alice,5,
