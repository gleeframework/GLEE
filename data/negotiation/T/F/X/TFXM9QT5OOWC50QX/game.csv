"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is too high for me.  I'm interested in this product, but my budget is significantly lower.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This is a serious offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I could consider a price of $1,300,000. This reflects a substantial reduction on my part while acknowledging the product's worth.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000 for this product. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value I place on it and your desire to sell.  Let's try to reach an agreement at this point.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down further, but I need you to meet me partway. Let's settle this at $1,150,000. This represents a significant price adjustment on my end while still reflecting the true value of the product.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating. However, $1,150,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm ready to pay $1,000,000 for this product, which is a substantial amount and represents a good deal for both of us.  I truly hope you'll consider this final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
