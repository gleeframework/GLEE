Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price?

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While it's only $5 more than what John is offering, it's worth it to avoid further negotiation and to secure a deal."
