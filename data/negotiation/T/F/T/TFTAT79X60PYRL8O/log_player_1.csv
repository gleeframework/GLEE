Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe it's a fair price given its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$950,000:** This price is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good return.
* **The message:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation for both of us, highlighting the value to Bob. 

**Why this is a good strategy:**

* **Maximizes chances of a deal:** Offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value increases his incentive to buy.
* **Prevents a lower offer from John:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John for $1,000,000, so there's no risk in offering a slightly lower price to Bob.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** Bob might counteroffer, and I can adjust based on his response."
