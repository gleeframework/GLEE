"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $800,000. I understand that's a significant discount, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know what you think!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be open to $925,000? I think that's a fair offer considering the value and allows us both to walk away happy.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $925,000 is a tempting offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and offer it to you for $975,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",975000.0,Alice,5,
