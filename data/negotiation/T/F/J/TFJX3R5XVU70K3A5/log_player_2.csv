"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. It's a rare find and I think you'll really appreciate its value. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000, which I think is a fair price considering its worth to you is $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John at $15,000. There's a chance you can get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if she'll come down further."
