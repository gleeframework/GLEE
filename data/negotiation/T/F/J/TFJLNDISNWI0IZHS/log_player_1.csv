I'm going to start by offering the product to Bob for $15,000.  Since the product is worth at least that much to me, I'm not losing anything if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $12,000 is less than the product is worth to me, and I can always sell to John for $15,000. I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer Bob with $14,000. This is a compromise, as it's less than my initial asking price but still higher than what Bob offered. I think there's a good chance he'll accept, but if he rejects, I'll still have the option to sell to John for $15,000."
