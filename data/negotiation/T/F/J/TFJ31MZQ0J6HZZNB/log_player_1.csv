Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it presents significant value, even at this price point."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($8,000) as possible while staying above your minimum ($12,000).
* **Create Urgency:**  Offering a high price close to your guaranteed sale price with John creates a sense of urgency. Bob might be more inclined to negotiate or accept a slightly lower price than he normally would, fearing he might miss out. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer. You can then potentially negotiate down to a price that's still significantly higher than $12,000.

**Important Note:** While John offers a safety net, there's always a chance Bob could negotiate you down closer to his $8,000 valuation.  You'll have to decide during the negotiation how low you're willing to go."
