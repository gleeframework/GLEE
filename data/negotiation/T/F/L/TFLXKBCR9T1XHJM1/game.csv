"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $100.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",100.0,Alice,3,

I'm still not comfortable with $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $95?,95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm really hoping to get closer to $100.  Let's split the difference and go with $97.50.  That way we both get a good deal.",97.5,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $97.50 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to go down to $92?",92.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm really trying to find common ground here.  How about we meet at $94? It's just a little bit higher than your offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",94.0,Alice,7,
