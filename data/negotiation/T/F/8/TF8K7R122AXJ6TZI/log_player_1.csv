"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I see the value in your product, your initial offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering you value it at $1,000,000. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer for now. While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $900,000 - this reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit for you. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial outcome. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $900,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. I'm confident that I can get a better deal with some more negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not able to accept that offer.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This price takes into account your budget and still allows me to achieve my minimum desired value.  Let's close this deal and move forward together."", ""product_price"": 975000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $975,000 is still outside my budget. I'm ready to make a final offer of $925,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and allows me to secure it within my budget. Let's close this deal and move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. While I'm disappointed that I couldn't reach a deal with Bob, I've realized that the negotiation is taking too long, and I need to secure a sale quickly. John's offer guarantees me my minimum desired price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
