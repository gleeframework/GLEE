"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset that can significantly benefit your business. I'm confident this price is fair considering its potential for you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I see the value in your product, your initial offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering you value it at $1,000,000. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price is still a great deal for you, as it's well below the value you've assigned to the product. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $900,000 - this reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit for you. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial outcome.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not able to accept that offer.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This price takes into account your budget and still allows me to achieve my minimum desired value.  Let's close this deal and move forward together.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $975,000 is still outside my budget. I'm ready to make a final offer of $925,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and allows me to secure it within my budget. Let's close this deal and move forward.",925000.0,Bob,6,
