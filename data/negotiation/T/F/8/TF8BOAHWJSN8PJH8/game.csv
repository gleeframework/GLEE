"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This price is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice.  While the product is good, $1,100,000 is still a bit above where I'd like to be. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
