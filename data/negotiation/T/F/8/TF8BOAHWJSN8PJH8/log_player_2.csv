It's time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **We're close to her limit:** Alice has consistently countered around the $1,050,000 mark. Her responses suggest she's unlikely to go much lower.
* **Limited rounds:** We only have one round left. If we reject and counter, we risk her walking away, leaving us to buy from John at a much higher price.
* **Good deal:** While we could push for a slightly lower price,  $1,050,000 is still a significant saving compared to John's $1,500,000. 

It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing it and overpaying later."
