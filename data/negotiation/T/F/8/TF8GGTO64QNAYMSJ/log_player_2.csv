Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $912,500 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit short of where I need to be. Let's split the difference and go with $918,750. This is a fair price that considers both of our needs and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $918,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $918,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate and has been moving closer to your desired price. At $918,750, you're getting a significant discount from her initial offer and are well below your $1,000,000 maximum.  

Continuing to negotiate might get you a slightly better price, but there's a risk Alice could become frustrated and the deal could fall through. It's better to accept a good offer now than risk losing the deal and having to buy from John for $1,000,000."
