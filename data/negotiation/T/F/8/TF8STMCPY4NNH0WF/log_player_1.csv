Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters, but it's still a decent price given my minimum value of $120.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is my minimum, I'd rather try to get a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $140. This is still a good price for me, and it might be enough to convince Bob to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is close enough to my minimum that I'm willing to accept it.  I'd rather sell to Bob than risk another round of negotiation and potentially having to sell to John for $120."
