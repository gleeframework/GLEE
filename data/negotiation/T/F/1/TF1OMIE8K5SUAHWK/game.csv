"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm a bit of a bargain hunter, so I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $105? That's a fair price for both of us, and it still gives you a good deal.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $105 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $105, so how about $97.50?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $97.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $100, which is my absolute bottom line.  This price is fair and allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,
