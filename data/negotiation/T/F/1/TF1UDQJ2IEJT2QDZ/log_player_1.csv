Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This allows room for negotiation without immediately rejecting Bob.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and encouraging message keeps the negotiation open and avoids pushing Bob away.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** $12,000 gives me some wiggle room to make counteroffers if Bob rejects the initial price.
* **John as a Safety Net:** The knowledge of John's offer provides me with a backup plan if negotiations with Bob fail.  

**Note:** This is just the initial offer. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some more. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly less than what I'd like to get. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can counteroffer with a price closer to my target.
* **John's Offer Remains a Strong Backup:** If further negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $15,000. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to $12,000. This will allow me to see if he's willing to compromise further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we split the difference? I'm offering the product for $10,500. This is a fair price that considers both our needs. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offering with a Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This shows a willingness to compromise and potentially reach an agreement.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the offer. This helps to keep the negotiation productive.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will give me a better understanding of how willing Bob is to increase his offer. If he rejects, I can either counter again with a price closer to my minimum or move on to John.

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I will adjust my strategy. If he accepts the offer, I'll secure the sale. If he rejects, I'll need to decide whether to counteroffer again or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but I'm still looking to save some more. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum, but Not Enough:**  Bob's offer of $9,500 is only $500 away from my minimum acceptable price of $9,000. However, it's still not a deal that's financially favorable to me.
* **Risk of Further Negotiations:**  There's no guarantee that Bob will increase his offer further, even if I counter. This could lead to a protracted negotiation that wastes my time and energy.
* **John's Offer is More Attractive:** John is offering $15,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer.  This difference outweighs the potential for a slight increase from Bob. 

**Conclusion:**

It's more profitable and less risky to sell the product to John at this point.  While I'd like to get a price closer to my initial goal, John's offer represents a much better financial outcome for me."
