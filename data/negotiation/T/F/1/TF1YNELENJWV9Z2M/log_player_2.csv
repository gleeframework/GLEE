"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is an incredible deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $11,500 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $12,000 from John if necessary. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of her coming back with a lower price, getting you a better deal."
