Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, it's always best to aim higher initially. Bob's valuation of $1,000,000 gives you room to negotiate.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a sense of a ""good deal"" for Bob, as it's significantly less than your guaranteed sale price. 
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" introduces a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a quicker decision.

**Outcome:**

* **If Bob accepts:** You make a profit of $400,000 (a significant gain over your minimum).
* **If Bob rejects:** You sell to John at your guaranteed price, ensuring you don't lose out on the opportunity."
