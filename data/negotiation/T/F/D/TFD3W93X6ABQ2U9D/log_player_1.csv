Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, considering my minimum value of $80 and the fact that I don't know Bob's value for the product. I'm hoping to get a good price, but I'm also open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $80 is my minimum, Bob's offer is essentially my floor.  I'm not going to lose any money by rejecting, and I have the potential to get more.  It's worth seeing if I can get a better price through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counter with $90.  This is still a decent profit for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but not give away the product for his rock-bottom price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is only $5 less than my counteroffer of $90, and it's above my minimum of $80.  At this point, it's not worth risking further negotiation and possibly losing out to John, who is willing to pay $80."
