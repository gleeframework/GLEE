"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product. However, I believe the price point is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep for you, but I have to ensure I get a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's value while also being more in line with your budget.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for a price closer to $700,000. Would you be open to that?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to get closer to $700,000, but I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair value for the product.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is getting close, but to be honest, I need to be at $750,000 for this to work for me.  What do you say?",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get as close as possible to your target price, but I've already made significant concessions. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is the last price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,7,
