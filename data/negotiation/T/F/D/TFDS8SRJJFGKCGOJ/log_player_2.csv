Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get as close as possible to your target price, but I've already made significant concessions.

This is a good point to take the deal.  Here's why:

* **Price is right:** $825,000 is a significant savings from both your $1,200,000 fallback option and Alice's initial offer. 
* **Alice is firm:** Her language suggests this is her final offer, pushing further could make her walk away.
* **Time is ticking:** You have fewer rounds to negotiate, and there's no guarantee of reaching a better price."
