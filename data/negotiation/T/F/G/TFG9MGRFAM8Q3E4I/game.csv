"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $1500000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for this product.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you have a budget constraint, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $1300000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1300000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1200000, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if that works for you.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'll give you a slight concession, but I need to make sure I get a good return on my investment. I'll counteroffer at $1250000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
