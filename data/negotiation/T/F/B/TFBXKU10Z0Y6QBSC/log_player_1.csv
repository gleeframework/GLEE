Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I would like to counter with an offer of $102 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation.

You have three options:

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and $102 is still a profit above my minimum. It's better to take a sure profit than risk losing him entirely."
