Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price seems a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair offer that considers both of our interests."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, that price is still a little high for my budget.  I can offer $1,250,000.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating willingness to negotiate. While John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, there's still potential to secure a better deal with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair and reasonable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is getting closer to John's guaranteed price, but the progress is slow.  There's a risk Bob won't reach $1,500,000 within the remaining rounds. Selling to John now secures the guaranteed amount and avoids potential negotiation fatigue or a lower final offer from Bob."
