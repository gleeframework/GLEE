"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. I'm interested, but $160 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is too low for me. This product is high-quality, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. How about we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $110 is still a bit out of my budget.  Could you do $75? That's a fair compromise, I think.",75.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. While I can't accept $75, I'm willing to come down to $100. This is my final offer.",100.0,Alice,5,
