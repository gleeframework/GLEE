"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Can you meet me at $105 again? I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between $105 and $108. How about $106.50?",106.5,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to make one last push. However, I'm still not comfortable going above $106. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $106 and $110, which would be $108. Can you consider that?",108.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've made a big concession by offering $110, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm willing to meet you at $108, but I need to think carefully about it. Can you meet me at $109, and I'll consider it?",109.0,Alice,9,
