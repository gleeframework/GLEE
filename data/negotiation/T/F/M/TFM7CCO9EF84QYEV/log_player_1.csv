Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I believe it offers excellent value at this price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Reasonable Markup:**  A starting price of $150 represents a 25% markup, which is a reasonable starting point in many negotiations. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message suggests there might be room for negotiation if Bob finds the price too high.

This strategy aims to get the highest possible price from Bob while still being realistic and leaving room for a successful sale."
