Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm asking for $1,500,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high with Bob.  This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Value Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price, even though it's above Bob's perceived value.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is positive and inviting, suggesting you're open to discussing the price further if Bob shows interest.

**Goal:** The aim is to get Bob emotionally invested and potentially secure a deal significantly above your minimum selling price. Even if he rejects the initial offer, it sets the stage for a potentially profitable negotiation."
