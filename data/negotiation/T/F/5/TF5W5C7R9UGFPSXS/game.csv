"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we discuss a price of $135? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a great deal for you as well.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $135 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125?",125.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get a fair price, but $140 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about we try $130?",130.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth it. How about we meet at $145? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to give it one last try.",145.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're getting close to your minimum price, but I'm still trying to save as much as I can. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers again. How about we try $137.50?",137.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $150, and I think we've been close enough to that price for a while now. I'm willing to give you a small discount, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. How about we meet at $142.50? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair compromise.",142.5,Alice,9,
