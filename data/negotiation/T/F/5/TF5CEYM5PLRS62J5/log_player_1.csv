Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you and a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$11,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of $10,000 but below my minimum value of $12,000. 
* **The message:**  I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation for both of us. This sets a positive tone for the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a quick deal that is fair for both of us. This initial offer leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer, but it also incentivizes him to accept as it's a good price for him.  

If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counteroffer again, but I'll also keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $12,000 if the negotiation with Bob stalls."
