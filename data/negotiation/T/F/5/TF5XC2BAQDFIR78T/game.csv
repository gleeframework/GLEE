"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate that you're willing to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but  $115 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $105?  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $108. It's a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you say?",108.0,Bob,4,
