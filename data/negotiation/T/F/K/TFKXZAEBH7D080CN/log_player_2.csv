"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a great price.  What do you say to a price of $120? Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's offer of $120 is a good deal since it's less than your maximum budget of $150 and significantly less than John's offer of $150."
