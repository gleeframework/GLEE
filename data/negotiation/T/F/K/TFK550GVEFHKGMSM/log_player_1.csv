Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $15,000 to me, I'll try to get as close to that as possible. I'll offer Bob the product at a price of $12,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Since Bob's offer is lower than the product's value to me, I'll reject his offer and try to get a better deal. I'll send a counteroffer to Bob.

I'll offer Bob the product at a price of $11,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and it's still higher than the product's value to Bob.
