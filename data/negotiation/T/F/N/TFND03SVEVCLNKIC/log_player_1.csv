Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 149}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob before resorting to selling to John at $150. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $149 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still staying above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **High Starting Point:** While Bob might value the product at $80, he might be willing to pay more if he perceives the product as having high value or if he needs it urgently. 

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob will reject this offer. However, it's a calculated risk to maximize potential earnings."
