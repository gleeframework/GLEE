"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm happy to start the negotiation at $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's lower than John's price, it's still above the product's value to Alice ($800,000).  This suggests there's room for negotiation.
* **Counteroffer strategy:** By rejecting, Bob can start the counteroffer process. He can aim for a price closer to the product's value to Alice, potentially getting a much better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value, but I can't sell it for less than $1,050,000. This offer reflects the true worth of this product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While she has lowered her price, it's still higher than the product's value to her ($800,000).  There's still potential to negotiate further.
* **Counteroffer strategy:** Bob should continue to counteroffer. He can aim for a price closer to his initial counteroffer of $950,000 or propose a price slightly above Alice's minimum acceptable price, potentially reaching a compromise."
