Bob should reject Alice's offer. $15,000 is far more than Bob is willing to pay. It makes sense to try to negotiate with Alice first."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $13,000. It's a fair price, considering the value it will bring to you. What do you think?

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's limit.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice before going to John."
