"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of your product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my target price.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for the value this product brings.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
