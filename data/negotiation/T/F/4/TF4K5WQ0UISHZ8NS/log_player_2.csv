"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget and your maximum willingness to pay.  It's better to reject and start counter-offering to see if you can get a more agreeable price."

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum willingness to pay. While it's closer to my budget, it's still not a good deal. I'll reject her offer and counteroffer again, hoping to find a more agreeable price."
