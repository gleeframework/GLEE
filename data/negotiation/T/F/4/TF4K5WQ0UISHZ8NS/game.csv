,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your starting price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than your offer.  I could consider letting it go for $1,800,000. This is a compromise, but I believe it reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $1,800,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
