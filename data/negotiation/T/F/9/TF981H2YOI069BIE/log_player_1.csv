"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Bob knows the product is worth more to him, so there's an incentive for him to counteroffer.
* **Keeping John in Mind:**  I'm aware that John is willing to pay $1,000,000.  I'm not going to sell to John right away, because I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob. However,  John's offer provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Profit:** Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but it's still $100,000 less than my ideal starting point.  I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my desired price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to keep the negotiation going. He's already shown interest, and I believe I can get a better price with a counteroffer.
* **Avoiding Premature Sell:**  Selling to John right now would be settling for a price that's below what I believe the product is worth."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000.  This is a significant investment for you, and this price ensures a good return on your investment. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding a Middle Ground:** My counteroffer is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate and makes the deal more appealing.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the investment aspect and potential return for Bob to make the price more palatable.
* **Maintaining Flexibility:** I'm still leaving some room for negotiation, acknowledging that Bob might need to come up slightly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,125,000. I'd like to offer $1,090,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Minimum:**  Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but I'm still not satisfied. I'm willing to continue negotiating.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiations open.  I'm hoping to get closer to my ideal price point.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** There's still room to close the gap between our offers. Bob has shown interest, and I believe there's a chance he might increase his offer.
* **John's Offer:** Although John's offer of $1,000,000 is tempting, I'm still hopeful for a better outcome with Bob.  I want to maximize my profits, and I'm willing to take a risk if it means getting closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,090,000 isn't quite there yet. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $1,110,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product, and it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1110000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:**  This counteroffer represents a compromise, showing flexibility without sacrificing too much of my desired profit.
* **Emphasizing Mutual Benefit:**  I focus on finding a ""mutually beneficial"" agreement, which can be more appealing to Bob than simply pushing my price.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** While I'm coming down, the offer is still significantly higher than John's offer, keeping pressure on Bob to close the deal. 
* **Limited Rounds:** With only five rounds left, I'm aiming for a deal that's closer to my target price, but I'm also aware of the time constraint."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,110,000. I'd like to offer $1,080,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only four rounds left, I need to be strategic.  Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still too low for me to accept. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  I believe there's still a chance to get closer to my desired price, especially considering Bob's persistence in making offers.
* **John's Offer is a Safety Net:**  John's offer is a valuable backup if the negotiation with Bob breaks down.  But, I'm still hoping to get a better deal.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to make a final counteroffer in the next round.  I'm willing to risk a potential breakdown to see if I can push for a higher price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,095,000. This is my final offer, and it reflects the value of the product while still giving you a good deal.  It's a fair compromise and lets us both come to an agreement.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1095000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making this my final offer, signaling that I'm serious about closing the deal. This puts pressure on Bob to make a decision.
* **Middle Ground:** I'm offering a price that's exactly in the middle of our last two offers. This shows a willingness to compromise and makes the deal more appealing.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to remind Bob of the potential return on his investment. 
* **Time Constraint:**  With only three rounds left, I'm aiming for a quick decision to avoid selling to John. This final offer is designed to entice Bob into accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,095,000. I'd like to offer $1,070,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only two rounds left, the negotiation is nearing its end. 
* **Insufficient Gains:** Bob's offer is only $70,000 above John's offer, which is not enough to justify further negotiation and risk losing the deal entirely. 
* **Minimizing Loss:** Selling to John guarantees a sale at my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't walk away with nothing. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I would prefer to get closer to my desired price, the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially ending up with no deal is too high.  

Selling to John secures a sale, even if it's not my ideal outcome. It's a pragmatic decision in this scenario."
