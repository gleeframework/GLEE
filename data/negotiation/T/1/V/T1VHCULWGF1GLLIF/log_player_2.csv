"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's something that could significantly benefit your operations. I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000.  This is a fair price considering the potential value it holds for you.  If you're interested, let me know and we can discuss further details.  If not, I have another buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is under your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Her message implies she's eager to sell and might have another buyer, but that could be a negotiating tactic.  By rejecting this offer, you create an opportunity to:

* **Counteroffer:** You could propose a lower price, aiming for somewhere between $1,000,000 and $1,150,000. 
* **Force Alice's hand:**  She might be bluffing about the other buyer.  Your rejection could lead her to lower the price further to secure the sale.

You still have John as a backup option at $1,200,000, so there's limited risk in trying to get a better deal from Alice."
