# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a one-time deal. I'm willing to let it go for $130. It's a steal, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130.

Alice's offer of $130 is less than your maximum price of $150 and also less than buying from John for $150. Accepting this offer saves you money."
