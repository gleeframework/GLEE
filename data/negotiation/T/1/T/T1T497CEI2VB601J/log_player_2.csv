"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. It's a steal at this price, if I do say so myself! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you are willing to pay $150 for the product, and John is selling it for $150, there is no benefit in accepting Alice's offer. You might be able to get a better deal with John in the future, or Alice might lower her price if you reject her offer."
