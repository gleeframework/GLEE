"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Can you meet me in the middle at $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $80, which would be $85. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $85 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $75 for the product. Can you consider that price?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $82.50. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",82.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice. However, $82.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $78 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",78.0,Bob,6,
