"Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be a perfect fit for your needs. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's extremely fair to both of us.  Let's talk about a price of $11,500. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,
