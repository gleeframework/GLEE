"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $775,000, which still leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's meet in the middle on this.",775000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $775,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to meet you at $725,000, which I think is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  However, $725,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $750,000, which is a fair compromise and allows us to both get a good deal.  Let's try to finalize this.",750000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, but I'm afraid $750,000 is still too high for me. I'd like to make a final offer of $725,000, which I believe is the best compromise we can reach. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $800,000.",725000.0,Bob,6,
