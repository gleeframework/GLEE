"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $1400000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be compensated for the product's value. I'm proposing $1550000. This is still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it reflects the product's potential.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
