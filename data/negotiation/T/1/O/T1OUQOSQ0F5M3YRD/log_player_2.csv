"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price. Given its high value and quality, we believe it's worth more than $80 to you. Considering its actual worth of $120, I'm extending this opportunity to purchase it for $95. This is a great chance to get a fantastic deal on something you truly value. Please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is less than your maximum budget of $120 and significantly less than buying from John for $120. While you could try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, there's no guarantee she'll go lower and you risk losing the deal. Accepting this offer represents a good balance of acquiring the product and saving money."
