Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, the value this product offers is significantly higher than your proposed price. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000  as a show of good faith, but that's my firm limit."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Could we meet in the middle somewhere, perhaps around $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly moving towards my price, but I'm still better off aiming higher. I'll hold firm for now and see if I can negotiate him up further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be completely transparent, I have another offer on the table for a million. However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I value our negotiation. Would you be willing to meet me at $900,000?"",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's closer, but I'm still a bit off.  I could potentially do $800,000.  This is my final offer, as John is also willing to sell at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** This is a tricky situation.  Bob has now reached his maximum valuation and has introduced competition (John selling at the same price). While I could push for more, there's a real risk Bob will walk away. Accepting $800,000 ensures a significant profit and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
