"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this amazing product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $100.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the optimal choice."
