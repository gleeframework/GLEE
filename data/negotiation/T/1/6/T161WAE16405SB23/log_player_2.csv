The product is worth $15,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $20,000. It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $16,000 for this product, given its value to me. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $18,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $18,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $17,000. This is my final offer, let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $17,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $18,250. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,250.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,250

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value of this product, I'm still not quite at $18,250.  How about we split the difference and go with $17,625?  This would allow us both to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 17625}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your creative suggestion, but I'm not willing to meet you at $17,625. I'm still holding out for $18,500. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you, and I'm willing to hold firm on this one. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is holding firm on a price that's higher than Bob's comfort zone. With only a few rounds remaining, Bob's chances of negotiating a lower price are diminishing. It's more prudent to buy the product from John at $15,000, which aligns with Bob's initial budget and ensures a successful transaction."
