"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive deal on this fantastic product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I think you won't want to pass up. I'm willing to let it go for $20,000.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $16,000 for this product, given its value to me. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",16000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $18,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $18,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $17,000. This is my final offer, let's see if we can finalize this deal.",17000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $17,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $18,250. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",18250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value of this product, I'm still not quite at $18,250.  How about we split the difference and go with $17,625?  This would allow us both to close this deal.",17625.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your creative suggestion, but I'm not willing to meet you at $17,625. I'm still holding out for $18,500. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you, and I'm willing to hold firm on this one. What do you think?",18500.0,Alice,7,
