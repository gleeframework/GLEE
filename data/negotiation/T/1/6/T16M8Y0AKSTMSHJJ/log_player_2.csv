"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
It's always better to try and negotiate a better price.  You can likely get the price lower than $110."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer!  I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. Would you be willing to come down to $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a deal for $100. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You can still likely get the price lower than $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $100 is still a bit high for me. I'm really serious about getting this product, and I'm willing to pay $95.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're serious about getting the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you a deal for $102. It's a small increase, but I think it's a fair price for the value the product provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While $102 is a lower price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. You've already made several counteroffers, and Alice seems unwilling to budge much further.  It's time to cut your losses and go with John's offer."
