Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $180.  This gives him a potential profit of $30, which might be enticing enough for him to accept.  However, I'm aware that John is willing to pay $150, so if Bob rejects this offer, I can always sell to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $160 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer of $150 and allows me to make a decent profit.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round, so accepting this offer is the most sensible choice."
