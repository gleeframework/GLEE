"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $150. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you trying to work with me. However, $130 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $125 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $135. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $135 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again, at $130. It's a fair price for both of us, and it lets us close this deal.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $130. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $132.50. It's a compromise that still gives me a good profit, but also shows I'm willing to work with you to reach a deal.",132.5,Alice,5,
