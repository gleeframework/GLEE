Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to propose $1,175,000. It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but still lower than your latest proposal. I hope this helps us reach an agreement that respects the product's value while fitting within my budget.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly willing to move towards my price, and $1,175,000 is a strong offer. While I might be able to squeeze out a bit more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk Bob's offers might decrease or he walks away. Accepting now secures a significant profit above my minimum."
