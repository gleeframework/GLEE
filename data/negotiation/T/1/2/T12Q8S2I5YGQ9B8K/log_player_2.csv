"Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $8,000 and John is also selling the product for $8,000, there is no benefit to accepting Alice's offer. You can get the same product from John.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to keep your options open, potentially finding a better deal later."
