I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me a good starting point, considering my minimum value is $10,000. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum value, so I'm not losing money by rejecting it. I want to see if I can get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, hopefully showing I'm willing to negotiate but still trying to get a better price than Bob's offer."
