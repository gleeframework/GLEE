,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $70. How about we meet in the middle at $82? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $82 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $75 for the product. Can you meet me at that price?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $75. How about we compromise at $80? It's the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",80.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $78. How about we meet in the middle at $79? It's the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",79.0,Alice,7,

"I'm getting a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $78? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",78.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $78. I'm willing to pay $76 for the product. That's my final offer. If you can't meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $150.",76.0,Bob,10,
