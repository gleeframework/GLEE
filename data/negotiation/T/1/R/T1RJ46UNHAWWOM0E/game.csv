"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. That's a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to reach an agreement. I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000, but that's my final offer.  If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm going to have to move on to other buyers.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
