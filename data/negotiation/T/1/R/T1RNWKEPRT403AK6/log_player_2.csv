"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for less than $10,000, and there's no reason to settle for a higher price when he can try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. It's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can still get the product for less than $9,800, and there's no reason to settle for a higher price when he can try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see you're serious about getting this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle at $9,800, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal? This way, you'll get a great product and I'll get a fair price. Let's talk about the extras. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While the ""extras"" might be appealing, he can still get the product for less than $9,800 without them, and there's no reason to settle for a higher price when he can try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm still hoping for a lower price.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  That's a fair compromise, and it'll allow us to close the deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see we're close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, but I'd like to propose a small adjustment. I'll throw in an additional service that will add significant value to the product. This way, the price remains the same, but you'll get even more bang for your buck. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. The additional service is a bonus, and at $9,500, he's getting a good deal. It's better than paying $12,000 to John, and continuing to negotiate might not lead to a better price, especially since Alice is willing to meet him at $9,500."
