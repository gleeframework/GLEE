**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down, the negotiations are progressing slowly and it's unlikely we'll reach a price significantly lower than John's offer of $800,000.  At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation with Alice are outweighed by the risk of her increasing the price or the deal falling through. Buying from John guarantees the product at our target price."
