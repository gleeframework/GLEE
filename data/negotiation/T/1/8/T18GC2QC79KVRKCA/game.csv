"Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product for a steal at $220. I think you'll find it's a fantastic deal!",220.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $220 is way too high for me.  I'm only willing to pay $80. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to me. Let's make a deal.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $220 is quite a leap from $80.  How about we meet somewhere in the middle? I'm willing to let it go for $180.",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $180 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $100. That's a significant increase from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $100 is closer, but still quite a ways off from what I need to get for it. Let's settle this right now - how about $160?",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still not there.  I'm willing to go up to $120, but that's my absolute maximum.  Let's finalize this deal.",120.0,Bob,6,
