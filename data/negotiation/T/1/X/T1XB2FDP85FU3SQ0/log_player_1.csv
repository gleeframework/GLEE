Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal, considering its worth to both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your bottom line:** You have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 to John, so you shouldn't accept anything less from Bob.
* **Maximizing profit:**  You aim to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible without going below your own minimum. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you could still settle on a price above your guaranteed sale. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob and maximizing your potential profit."
