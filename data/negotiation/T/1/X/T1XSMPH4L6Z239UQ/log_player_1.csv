Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've chosen a price of $100. This is above Bob's perceived value of $80, but still lower than my minimum of $120. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit.
* **Message:** I'm trying to build a rapport with Bob by emphasizing the value of the product for him and expressing confidence in his satisfaction. This can make him more likely to accept my offer.

**Strategy:**

By starting with a relatively high price, I can see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product.  If he rejects, I can lower the price in subsequent counteroffers while still making a profit.  I have the safety net of John's offer to fall back on if I can't reach an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $90 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's better to accept his offer than to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with nothing.  Selling to John for $120 is a guaranteed outcome, but accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a sale and potentially build a relationship with a new customer."
