Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $800,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate and leaves a significant profit margin. It's also a strong opening position to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from my initial offer to show willingness to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a significant profit and a price point closer to my desired value.  This counteroffer also shows Bob that I am serious about selling the product to him, but I am not willing to settle for a price that is too far below my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $950,000 is getting closer to my desired price, and it's higher than John's offer of $800,000. I'm willing to accept this offer to secure the sale and make a profit."
