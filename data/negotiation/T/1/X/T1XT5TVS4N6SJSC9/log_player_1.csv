Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $100 right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

While Bob's valuation matches my minimum, it's unlikely he'll go higher. Accepting his offer would mean no profit. John guarantees the same amount without further negotiation."
