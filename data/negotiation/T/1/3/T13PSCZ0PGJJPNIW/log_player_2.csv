"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know the product is worth a lot more to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's ideal price range. There are 9 rounds remaining, providing ample opportunity to negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter with a lower price and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity, but I'm looking to get the product for closer to $12,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $13,000? That's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his target.  Bob can continue to negotiate and potentially secure a price closer to $12,000.  With several rounds remaining, the risk of losing the deal is low.  It's better to keep trying to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $12,500.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're holding firm on your price. Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $13,500. This is a good price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still determined to get the product for as close to his target price of $12,000 as possible. While Alice's offer of $13,500 is getting closer, it's still not within Bob's ideal range.  He has five rounds remaining, which gives him some leverage to continue negotiating. Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows Bob to try and bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit higher than where I need to be.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $13,000.  This is a fair price, given the value of the product.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 13000}
