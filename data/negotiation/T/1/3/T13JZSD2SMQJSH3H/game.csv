"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $90 is a bit high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. How about we meet in the middle at $82.50? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $82.50 is still a little high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $80 for the product, which would be a fair price for both of us.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $80 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $81.50. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for this amazing product.",81.5,Alice,5,
