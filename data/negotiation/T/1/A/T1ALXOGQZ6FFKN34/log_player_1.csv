"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $110 for it."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum because I have a backup buyer in John. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob is willing to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $90 is a bit lower than I can go right now.  How about we split the difference and settle on $100?  That's still a good deal for you, and it works for me."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $92 is still a little too low for me. Let's compromise one more time.  If you're willing to go up to $95, we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still very interested in the product, and I'd like to revisit my previous offer of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $100.  While Bob's offer of $90 is tempting, I've reached a point where I'm unlikely to get a higher price from him, and John is guaranteeing me my minimum acceptable price."
