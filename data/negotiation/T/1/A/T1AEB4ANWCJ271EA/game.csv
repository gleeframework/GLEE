"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,100,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is significantly below its true worth. Let's find a middle ground. How about we agree on $975,000? This reflects the product's value while still offering you a reasonable price.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $975,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $850,000.  This reflects the value of the product while also staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
