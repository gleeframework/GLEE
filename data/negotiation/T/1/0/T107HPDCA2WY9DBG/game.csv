"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,300,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our previous discussions.  I hope you'll consider it.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
