"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still within a reasonable range to incentivize negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This price gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary, while still aiming for a profitable sale.
* **Friendly tone:** The message is friendly and open to discussion, encouraging Bob to engage in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,750,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Opportunity for negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a more reasonable price and continue the negotiation process.  
* **Exploring options:** While selling to John for $1,500,000 is a safe option, I'm willing to risk further negotiation with Bob to potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, but gives us both room to reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a lower but still profitable price:** $1,400,000 is a substantial drop from my initial offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.  This shows flexibility while protecting my interests.
* **Highlighting value:**  I emphasize the product's value to justify the price. 
* **Focus on agreement:** The message encourages Bob to find common ground and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering our previous discussions and my budget limitations. I hope you'll consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $1,200,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for higher offer:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, I'm willing to take the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob, hoping for a better outcome."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,300,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our previous discussions.  I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By splitting the difference, I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my desired range.
* **Focus on fairness:** I emphasize that the offer is ""fair"" considering both the product's value and past negotiations.
* **Urgency:** By stating ""I hope you'll consider it,"" I subtly hint at the possibility of moving on to other options if Bob doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still not quite there yet. My final offer is $1,250,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while staying within my budget.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not enough:**  While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, it's still not enough. 
* **Few rounds left:** With only 4 rounds remaining, I need to be careful about losing valuable time. However, I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly lower than my desired amount.
* **Potential for better outcome:** I believe there's a good chance that Bob might increase his offer slightly in the next round. 
* **Balancing risk:** While selling to John is always an option, I'm willing to take the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob, hoping for a slightly higher price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand this is a difficult negotiation, and I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000.  This price recognizes your budget constraints while ensuring I receive a fair amount for the product.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Increase:** I'm offering a slight increase from my previous counteroffer to show flexibility while staying close to my preferred price. 
* **Finality:** The message emphasizes finality by suggesting ""Let's finalize this deal."" This creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to accept.
* **Fairness:**  I reiterate that the price is ""fair"" to both parties. This helps maintain a positive tone while reinforcing the value of the product."
