"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm very interested in the product, $925,000 is still a bit higher than where I'd like to be. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $850,000.  It's a fair price, and I believe it reflects the value of this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $925,000 is still a bit above your target price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,
