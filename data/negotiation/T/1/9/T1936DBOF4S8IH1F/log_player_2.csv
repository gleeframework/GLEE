**Explanation:**

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $925,000 is still a bit above your target price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's latest offer of $875,000 is a good deal for you. It's significantly lower than your initial valuation of $1,200,000 and  only slightly higher than your previous offer of $850,000.  Continuing to negotiate may lead to a lower price, but there's a risk that Alice will walk away, and you'll be forced to buy from John at a much higher price ($1,200,000).  Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product at a good price and avoids the risk of losing the deal."
