Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  $11,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  The offer is not so high that it immediately discourages Bob. 
* **Show flexibility:** It demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate. 

It's important to remember that I can always fall back on John's offer of $12,000 if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to accept a price that undervalues it.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a price we're both happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a little further to $11,000. This price reflects the product's value and still allows you a good deal. Let's see if we can finalize this."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $11,000. This is:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:**  This shows I'm willing to compromise but still value the product.
* **Closer to my minimum:** It gets me closer to my desired price of $12,000.
* **Communicates my willingness to negotiate:**  It shows I'm open to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.

I believe this counteroffer is a fair compromise that could potentially lead to a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'm willing to go up to $10,750. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,750 is still too low for me. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $12,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. Therefore, I will sell the product to John for $12,000."
