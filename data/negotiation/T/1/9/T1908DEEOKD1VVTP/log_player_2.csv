# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth $10,000 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $12,000. It's better to try and negotiate with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product. Let me know what you think.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice has come down to $11,000, which is closer to Bob's ideal price of $10,000. However, Bob can still try to negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows him to make another counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant at $11,000.  I'm willing to go to $10,500. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're getting close to your target price, but I'm still looking to get a bit more value out of this deal. I'm willing to meet you at $10,800. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800.

```

Alice's offer of $10,800 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay, and further negotiation may take too long. At this point, it's more efficient for Bob to buy the product from John for $10,000, ensuring a good deal and avoiding further negotiation."
