"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! After considering your interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I think you'll find it's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly lower than your maximum willingness to pay of $15,000. This means you can save $3,000 by accepting her offer. While you could get the product for $8,000 from another seller (John), it's still a good deal to accept Alice's offer and save some money."
