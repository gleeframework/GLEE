"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and features, I'm asking for $18,000. I think it's a fair starting point for negotiation. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I think $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider this price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly less than what I had in mind.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is my final offer.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down to $16,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14,000. Can you consider this price?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $14,000 is still cutting it close to my bottom line. I can do $15,000, but that's my absolute final offer.",15000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that $15,000 is your absolute final offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,500. Can you reconsider?",13500.0,Bob,6,
