"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer it to you for $850,000.",850000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $850,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a lower price, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $820,000. What do you think?",820000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $820,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $780,000. I think this is a fair price that allows both of us to make a reasonable deal. What do you say?",780000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to find a fair price, Bob. However, I've already compromised quite a bit from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you at $790,000, but I think that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",790000.0,Alice,5,
