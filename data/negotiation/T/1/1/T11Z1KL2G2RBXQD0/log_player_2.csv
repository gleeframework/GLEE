 Alice's offer is very close to my maximum budget, but there's still room for negotiation.  I'll try a counteroffer to see if I can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to go down to $90. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $105. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $120.

Alice is moving closer to my range, but I think there's still some wiggle room. I'll try another counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not comfortable going down to $98. I'll meet you at $102. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me is $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and $102 is a reasonable price. It's better to accept this offer than risk the price going up or having to buy from John for $120."
