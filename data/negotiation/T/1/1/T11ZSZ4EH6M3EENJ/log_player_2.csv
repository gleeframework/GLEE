"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd find very useful. I'm offering it to you for $95. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $95 is less than the $100 from John, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower offer, aiming to find a middle ground. $85 is closer to Alice's value of $80, making it more likely for her to accept. It also leaves room for further negotiation in future rounds if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $85 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90, let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** $90 is still within Bob's budget of $100 and a better deal than John's offer.
* **Negotiation:**  While Bob could try to push for a lower price, the potential gain might not be worth the risk of Alice rejecting the offer again. 
* **Time:**  Accepting the offer saves time and avoids further rounds of negotiation."
