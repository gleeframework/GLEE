Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd find very useful. I'm offering it to you for $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's close to my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay close to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not ready to sell just yet. I believe I can get a better price. I'll counter his offer and see if we can come to a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $85 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90, let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 90}
