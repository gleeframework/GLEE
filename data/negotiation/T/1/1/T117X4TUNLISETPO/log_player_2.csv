"Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $100 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $180.  This is significantly higher than Bob's maximum price. It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

Bob is trying to get the product for his maximum price of $100. This is a significant drop from Alice's asking price, but it's a starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $160 is closer to Bob's maximum price, it's still higher. Bob can continue negotiating and see if Alice will come down further. It's always better to try and get the best possible deal."

``` 

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway, offering $120. This is a reasonable compromise, as it's a significant decrease from Alice's last offer, but still higher than Bob's ideal price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is not budging much, and her latest offer is still too high for Bob. It's time to cut his losses and buy the product from John for $100. This guarantees Bob the product at his maximum price, and it saves him time and effort in further negotiations."
