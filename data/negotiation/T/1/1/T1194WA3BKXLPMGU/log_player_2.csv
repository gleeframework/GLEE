"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot more to you, and I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:**  While Bob is willing to pay up to $15,000, Alice's offer of $12,000 saves him $3,000. 
* **It's a win-win:** Alice gets a better price than her minimum of $8,000, and Bob gets a lower price than his maximum."
