"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $800,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $800,000 is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $700,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my costs.",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I see the value at $700,000, I need to stay closer to my budget. Would you consider $550,000?",550000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $550,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $650,000. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value to you and my costs.",650000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $650,000 is getting closer, but I need to be at $600,000 for this to work for me.  Do you think that's possible?",600000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're getting close to your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $620,000. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal.",620000.0,Alice,7,
