"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering the product to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  Since you value the product at $1,500,000, you can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a great deal, and I think you won't find a better offer elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a good deal for Bob.  It's lower than his initial offer of $1,100,000, and it's still within his budget of $1,500,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject his counteroffer, forcing him to either buy from John at a much higher price or walk away entirely.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price without risking a breakdown in negotiations."
