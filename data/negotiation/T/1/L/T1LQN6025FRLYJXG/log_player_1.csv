Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000. 
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,500,000.
* **John's Offer:** You have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to get Bob to accept an offer that's more beneficial than John's guaranteed offer.  By starting at $1,300,000:

* **Potential for Negotiation:** You leave room for Bob to negotiate, potentially pushing the price closer to his maximum perceived value. 
* **Above Your Minimum:**  Even if Bob negotiates down, you're still likely to get a price higher than $1,500,000.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't know the absolute maximum Bob would be willing to pay. If you had more information about Bob's financial limits, you could potentially push for a higher initial offer."
