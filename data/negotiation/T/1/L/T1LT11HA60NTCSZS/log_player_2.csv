"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll really love it, and I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $1,200,000. This is a great deal, and I think you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you in the middle at $1,000,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $900,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $900,000. Since you can get the product for $800,000 from John, it makes more financial sense to buy from John and save the extra $100,000."
