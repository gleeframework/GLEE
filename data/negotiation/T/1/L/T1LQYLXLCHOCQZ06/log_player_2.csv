"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth attempting to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to budge."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value I see in this product, I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1400000. This is a fair price considering the value I believe the product holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,400,000 is still above your budget.  You can likely negotiate further, especially since you already know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still confident that the product's value exceeds $1200000. However, I'm willing to compromise further. I'm now offering the product to you for $1300000. This is a reasonable price considering the product's unique features and benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is getting closer to your budget, it's still above what you're willing to pay. You know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's still room for negotiation with Alice. Rejecting this offer allows you to continue trying to drive the price down further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1250000, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment. I'll sell the product to you for $1280000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,280,000 is still a significant amount over what you're comfortable paying. You have a guaranteed alternative with John at $1,000,000. There's no guarantee that you can negotiate further with Alice and get the price down to your desired level.  Buying from John at this point saves you money and provides certainty."
