,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1800000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value I see in this product, I'd be willing to pay $1000000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1000000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1400000. This is a fair price considering the value I believe the product holds.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1400000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1200000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I've assessed and the price I can get elsewhere. Let's see if we can make this work.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still confident that the product's value exceeds $1200000. However, I'm willing to compromise further. I'm now offering the product to you for $1300000. This is a reasonable price considering the product's unique features and benefits.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'm happy to offer $1250000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1250000, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment. I'll sell the product to you for $1280000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",1280000.0,Alice,7,
