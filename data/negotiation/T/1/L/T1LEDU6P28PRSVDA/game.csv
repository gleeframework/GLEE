"Bob,  I appreciate your interest. $9,000 is a bit low for me, considering the value of the product. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. ",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $9,000, so I'll offer $10,250. Can you consider that?",10250.0,Bob,4,
