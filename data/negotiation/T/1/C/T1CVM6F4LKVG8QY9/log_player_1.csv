Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product and understand your position. However, I am only willing to pay up to $1,050,000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell now, I believe I can get a better price if I continue negotiating. $1,050,000 is still significantly less than what the product is worth to Bob. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you and allows me to get closer to my desired selling price.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
