Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with an ambitious price of $1,500,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I'm hoping to capitalize on Bob's potential interest.  If he rejects, I'll have to assess his counteroffer and see if we can still reach a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm happy to secure my minimum value, I'm not willing to give up on the possibility of a higher price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to lower my price to $1,350,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal. I'm hoping this will be enough to get him to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is only $50,000 less than what John is offering, and I'm not sure I'll be able to get a better price.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer to secure the sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
