"Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to negotiate a fair price.  I'm offering it for $1,400,000.  Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000? This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and it shows my commitment to making this deal work.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. I think that's a fair compromise considering the value I see in this product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,250,000 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating.  What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not going to see eye-to-eye on price. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to be at $1,320,000 to make this work for me. If you're not able to go that high, I may need to consider my other options.",1320000.0,Alice,7,
