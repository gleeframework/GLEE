"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. After considering your offer, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,350,000.

"Bob, I understand that you're firm on your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. Considering the value I believe the product brings, I'm willing to make one more compromise. My new counteroffer is $1,300,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
