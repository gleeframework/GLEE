"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to work together. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. There are 10 rounds, so there's time to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this product. While I'm very interested, my budget for this purchase is $1,200,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. After considering your offer, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,350,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value I believe the product brings. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but it's still above his budget. There are still 7 rounds left, giving Bob the opportunity to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While I value the product, my budget remains firm at $1,200,000.  If we can reach an agreement at that price, I'm ready to finalize the purchase.  Let's see if we can find a way to bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're firm on your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. Considering the value I believe the product brings, I'm willing to make one more compromise. My new counteroffer is $1,300,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still above Bob's budget at $1,300,000. While there are still 5 rounds left, Bob has been insistent on his $1,200,000 budget and Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate. However, it's unclear if she will continue to lower her offer to meet Bob's budget. At this point, it's safer for Bob to buy from John and guarantee the lowest price."
