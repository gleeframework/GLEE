"I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $120?",120.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $120 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $90 for it.  Let's try to meet in the middle.",90.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $90, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think $110 is a more reasonable price for this product. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,
