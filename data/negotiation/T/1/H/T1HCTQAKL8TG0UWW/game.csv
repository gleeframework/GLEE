"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it, considering its value to me is capped at $1,200,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While the product holds significant value at $2,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your previous offer, so I'll counter with $1,850,000. I hope we can find a price that works for both of us.",1850000.0,Bob,4,
