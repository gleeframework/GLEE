"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $150 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is offering the product for $150. Since you have a backup option to buy the product from John for the same price, you are not losing anything by rejecting Alice's offer. You can always go to John if you decide you want the product. This gives you a chance to see if Alice might lower her price if you reject her initial offer."
