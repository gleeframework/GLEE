"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I think your initial offer is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable starting point for further negotiation.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 undervalues the product significantly. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This reflects the true value and potential this product offers.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
