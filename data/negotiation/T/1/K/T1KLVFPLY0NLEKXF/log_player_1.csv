Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This would still leave you with a good profit, and it would be a great deal for me.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
