"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $900,000.  This is a very competitive offer for a product of this caliber.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $900,000 is still a little steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
