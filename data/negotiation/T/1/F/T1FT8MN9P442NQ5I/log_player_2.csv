"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but it leaves us room to negotiate upwards while staying well below our $15,000 limit and John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $13,000, which is still a great deal considering the value this product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice is coming down, but we can still negotiate further.  We'll reject this offer and propose something closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $11,000? That's a fair price for both of us."",

We're pushing slightly closer to the middle ground, aiming for a price that benefits both us and Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm willing to compromise a bit more. I can do $12,500, which is still a good deal for me, but also takes into account your desire to pay a lower price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for both of us. It's close enough to our target price and further negotiation may not yield significantly better results. Accepting now avoids the risk of Alice raising her price again."
