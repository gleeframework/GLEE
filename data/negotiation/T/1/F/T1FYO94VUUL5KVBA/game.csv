"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my value for the product and allows for a significant profit for you.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be fair to both of us, I can come down to $1,025,000. This still reflects the significant value this product offers.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm prepared to offer $912,500 for the product.  This would allow for a substantial profit for you while staying within my budget. ",912500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $912,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I need to get a bit more. How about we settle at $975,000? I think this is a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product.",975000.0,Alice,5,
