"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You are willing to pay no more than $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for it.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be fair to both of us, I can come down to $1,025,000. This still reflects the significant value this product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but her offer is still above your maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get a price closer to your desired range."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm prepared to offer $912,500 for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $912,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I need to get a bit more. How about we settle at $975,000? I think this is a fair compromise that reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly, her offer is still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's unlikely that further negotiation will get her down to your desired price, and John is offering the product at your budget limit.  Therefore, it's the most financially sensible option to buy the product from John."
