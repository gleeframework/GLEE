{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial. I'm asking for $1,450,000.  Let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss further!"",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a price close to your guaranteed sale price ($1,500,000) sets a high anchor. This makes Bob perceive the final price as a better deal if he negotiates you down. 
* **Slight Negotiation Room:**  Offering a slightly lower price than $1,500,000 allows for some negotiation room if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Urgency (Implied):** Mentioning that you believe the product is valuable ""for someone like you"" subtly implies that you have other potential buyers.

**Important:** While you have a guaranteed sale with John, aiming higher with Bob is a smart move.  Even if he negotiates you down a bit, you could still end up with a better deal than $1,500,000."
