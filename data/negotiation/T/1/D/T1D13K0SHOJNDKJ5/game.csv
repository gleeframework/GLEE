"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product looks great, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $11,000 is quite a bit lower than I hoped for. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $17,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for continuing this conversation.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $15,000 for this product. That's my final offer.",15000.0,Alice,5,
