"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to discuss."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advisable to start negotiations above your desired price. This allows room for concessions and signals that you value the product highly. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value and potential,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth, even though I know his valuation is lower.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Phrasing it as a ""starting point for discussion"" implies flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Alternative Option:**  Keep in mind my fallback option (selling to John) ensures I don't need to settle for anything less than $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is far below both my valuation and my initial asking price. Accepting this would mean a significant loss. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, especially with the security of John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and acknowledging the product's value. While I understand your perspective, $650,000 is significantly below what I can accept. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This reflects the true worth of what I'm offering."",
""product_price"": 975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:**  I want to maintain a positive and collaborative tone, so I start by appreciating his response.
* **Firm but Fair:** By stating his offer is ""significantly below"" acceptable, I'm standing firm on my valuation.
* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a substantial concession from $1,100,000 to $975,000. This shows willingness to negotiate but also aims to anchor the price closer to my target range. 
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob about the intrinsic value of the product to justify the higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, there's still a gap between our valuations. I'm willing to increase my offer to $720,000. I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $720,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving in the right direction, $720,000 is still too far from my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I need to see more significant increases from him to justify not selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise and your understanding of the value this product brings. To bridge the gap, I'm proposing a price of $900,000. This is a significant move on my end and reflects my strong desire to see you benefit from this opportunity."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Reinforcement:** Acknowledging Bob's efforts to compromise helps maintain a good negotiating atmosphere.
* **Strategic Concession:** I'm reducing my price by $75,000, demonstrating flexibility but remaining above my $800,000 target.
* **Framing:** By positioning the offer as a way for Bob to ""benefit,"" I'm subtly shifting the focus from price to the value proposition. 
* **Time Constraint (Implied):**  As we progress through the rounds, the implicit pressure of my alternative option (selling to John) increases."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm encouraged by the progress we're making. To meet you closer to the middle, I'm willing to offer $780,000. I'm hoping this demonstrates my serious interest in closing the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is negotiating incrementally, but his offer of $780,000 is still too far from my $900,000 offer. I need to signal that more significant movement is required to continue this negotiation.  I'm willing to risk him walking away at this point because I have the security of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but the gap between our positions remains significant.  I'm willing to make one final concession to get this done. If you're prepared to meet me at $850,000, we have a deal. Otherwise, I need to explore other options for this product."",
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Deadline:** I'm introducing a sense of urgency and a clear deadline for Bob to make a decision. 
* **Final Offer:** By explicitly stating this is my ""final concession,"" I'm signaling that I won't go any lower. 
* **Alternative Option:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of my ability to walk away and sell to John.
* **Meeting in the Middle (Slightly):**  My offer of $850,000 is a slight move from $900,000, but it's still above Bob's last offer and closer to my target.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a risk Bob might walk away, but the potential reward of getting closer to my desired price is worth it at this stage."
