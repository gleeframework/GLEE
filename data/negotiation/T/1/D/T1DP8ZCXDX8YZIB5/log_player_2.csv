Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but the gap between our positions remains significant.  I'm willing to make one final concession to get this done. If you're prepared to meet me at $850,000, we have a deal. Otherwise, I need to explore other options for this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has drawn a line in the sand and is unlikely to go much lower.  While a deal at $800,000 might still be possible, it's risky to continue negotiating. John offers a guaranteed price of $800,000, which meets your maximum budget. It's time to secure the product at the best guaranteed price."
