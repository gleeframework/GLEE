"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to start with a price of $1400000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should reject the initial offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Lower price:**  This counteroffer lowers the price significantly from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's serious intent to negotiate. 
* **Reasonable starting point:** $1,300,000 is still above Alice's minimum value of $1,200,000, suggesting a potential middle ground.
* **Positive tone:** The message maintains a polite and cooperative tone, fostering a good relationship with Alice for continued negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1350000, but I think that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Alice's offer is a reasonable compromise, falling between Bob's counteroffer and her previous offer. 
* **Saving money:** Accepting this offer saves Bob $50,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **Limited time:** With 7 rounds remaining, there's no guarantee that further negotiations will yield a better price. Accepting now secures a good deal while minimizing risk."
