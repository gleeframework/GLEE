"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think!",85.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest in the product.  I can't go as low as $85, but I'm willing to drop the price to $95.  This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you say?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really looking for something closer to $90.  Would you be willing to consider that?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $92.50.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to make this deal work.  Let me know what you think!",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping to stay under $90. Would you consider $91? That's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.",91.0,Bob,6,
