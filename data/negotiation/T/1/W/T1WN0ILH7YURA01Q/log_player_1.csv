"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than what Bob values the product at, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price.  This gives me some room to negotiate if he counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. That's the highest price I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, so I'll reject it. I'll try to counteroffer with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? I'm sure we can find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping this shows flexibility and encourages Bob to come closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm willing to pay $87.50 for the product. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to move closer to my target price.  There are still a few rounds left, and selling to John is always an option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand this is your final offer, but it's still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm raising the counteroffer slightly, but still trying to be flexible. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not going to settle for a price that's too low for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I really need to stick to my budget. I'm willing to pay $82.50 for the product. This is my last offer, I'm not willing to go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, and I'm running out of rounds.  It's getting too risky to continue negotiating with him.  I'll sell the product to John for $120, which is my minimum acceptable price and guarantees me a good profit."
