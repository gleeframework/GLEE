Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is a bit higher than my minimum value. This allows for some room for negotiation, but still puts me in a good position to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still too low. I'll counteroffer again in the next round.  While John offers a guaranteed $120, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial price of $150 with Bob."
