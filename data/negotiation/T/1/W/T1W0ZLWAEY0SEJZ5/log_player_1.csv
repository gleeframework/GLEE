"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000, making it tempting for him to accept.  However, it's still well above my minimum of $800,000, ensuring I get a good return on my investment. 

This first offer is a strategic move to gauge Bob's interest and potentially initiate a negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than my desired price range.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to potentially achieve a better deal closer to my initial $1,200,000 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price to $1,100,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to meet Bob halfway, while still securing a price closer to my initial offer. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that could lead to a successful deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is getting closer to my desired price range, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I believe I can get closer to my initial offer of $1,200,000 with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price again to $1,050,000. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price above Bob's last offer. I believe this counteroffer could be appealing enough for Bob to accept, given the consistent reduction in price and the proximity to his own offer."
