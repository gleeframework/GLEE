"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're only willing to pay $100, and her initial offer is significantly more than that.
* **There's no reason to buy from John yet.**  You have 10 rounds to negotiate with Alice, and there's a chance you can get a better price.

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to make a counteroffer in the next round.  Start by making a counteroffer closer to your maximum price point of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with your maximum price:**  You're willing to pay $100, so this sets the initial bar for the negotiation.
* **Be bold:**  While Alice might reject this offer initially, it establishes your firm position and leaves room for compromise in future rounds.

**Next Steps:**

We'll wait for Alice's response and continue the negotiation based on her counteroffer."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $155.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  You're only willing to pay $100, and her offer is still significantly more than that.
* **There's still time to negotiate.** You have 7 rounds left to potentially get a better price.

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to make another counteroffer in the next round. Consider increasing your offer slightly from $100 to signal a willingness to compromise, but still keep it below Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:**  Increasing your offer to $110 shows Alice you're serious about buying but are still pushing for a better price.
* **Staying within your budget:**  You're still below your $100 limit, leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  Alice is likely to counter with a lower price, giving you a chance to reach an agreement.

**Next Steps:**

We'll wait for Alice's response and continue the negotiation based on her counteroffer."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** It's getting closer to your maximum of $100, but it's still $60 more than you want to pay.
* **You have time to negotiate.** You have five rounds remaining, giving you ample opportunity to continue haggling.

**Next Steps:**

Make another counteroffer in the next round.  Consider increasing your offer a bit more, but stay within your budget and try to find a middle ground with Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  Increasing your offer to $120 shows Alice you're willing to move closer to her offer, but you're still pushing for a better price.
* **Staying within your budget:**  You're still below your $100 limit, leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Finding a middle ground:**  This offer is a midpoint between your previous offer of $110 and Alice's offer of $160.

**Next Steps:**

We'll wait for Alice's response and continue the negotiation based on her counteroffer.  Keep in mind that we only have four rounds left, so it's important to try to reach a deal before you have to buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** You only have three rounds left, and Alice is not budging significantly.
* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While she's come down a bit, her offer of $165 is still well above your $100 limit.
* **John's offer is a sure thing:** You're guaranteed to get the product for $100, and while it might not be the absolute lowest price, it's within your budget and you have a limited time to negotiate.

**Next Steps:**

Since you've chosen to buy from John, the negotiation with Alice is over. You've secured the product for a price you're comfortable with, and you've avoided risking further time and potentially losing the deal."
