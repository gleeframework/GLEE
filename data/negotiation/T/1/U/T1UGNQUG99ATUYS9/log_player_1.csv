Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $150 as possible (the price John will pay).
* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $120, so we need to offer a price higher than that.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $140 leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially reaching a price higher than $120 but still lower than John's $150 offer."
