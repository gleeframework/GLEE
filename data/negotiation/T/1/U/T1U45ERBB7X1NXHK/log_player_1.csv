"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $20000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a fair price for this valuable product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 16000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16000 is still a bit high for me. I'm firm on $10000.  If you're serious about selling, let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $10,000 is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm open to finding a middle ground, but $10,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $13,000. This is a fair price for the value I'm offering, and it's a significant step towards your offer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $13000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $10000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value we're both looking for in this transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $15,000.  Bob seems stuck on his $10,000 offer, and I'm not willing to go lower than $13,000.  It's time to cut my losses and move on to a more willing buyer."
