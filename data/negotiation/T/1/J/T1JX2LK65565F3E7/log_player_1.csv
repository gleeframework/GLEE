Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is strategically chosen:

* **It's higher than Bob's valuation:** $900,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $800,000. He might be willing to pay a little extra for it.
* **It's lower than my fallback price:** I'm still getting more than my fallback price of $1,000,000 from John, so I'm not losing anything if Bob rejects the offer.

This approach maximizes my chances of getting a higher price while still having a safety net."
