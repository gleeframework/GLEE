You can get the product from John for $150, and Alice is offering it for $140.  It's worth rejecting Alice's offer and trying to get a lower price from her."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $135?

You have three options:

Alice has lowered her price to $135. This is a good deal for you, as you're willing to pay up to $150, and John is selling it for $150. Accepting the offer saves you $15."
