"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'll reject the offer. If I accept, I'll be paying $1,400,000, which is $100,000 more than I want to spend. If I reject the offer, I can buy the product from John for $1,500,000, which is still within my budget. So, I'll choose to reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John.
