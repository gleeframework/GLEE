Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum price.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal.  Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum value gives him an incentive to buy from you rather than risk missing out.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers you."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Clear and Direct:** The message is straightforward, outlining the purpose and the offer.
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant benefits"" subtly reminds Bob of what's at stake.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The $1,400,000 price gives Bob a $100,000 discount on his perceived value, making it an attractive proposition while still netting you a significant profit.

**Important Note:**  This is just one potential offer. You can adjust the price slightly higher or lower depending on your risk tolerance and how aggressively you want to negotiate."
