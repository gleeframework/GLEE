"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's something I value at $8,000 or more, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's worth $10,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
