Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $120, which is higher than what Bob values the product at ($80), but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer positively, emphasizing the value and deal aspect to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Flexibility:** I'm leaving room to adjust the price if Bob makes a counteroffer.  I'm prepared to go down to $150 if needed, but hopefully, we can find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher Value:** While $90 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's room to negotiate further.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John as Backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $150 gives me leverage.  I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point.  I can go down to $105.  That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm  meeting Bob halfway, moving closer to his offer, but not going below my minimum.
* **Value Emphasis:** I reiterate that the price is still a ""good deal"" for him, reminding him of the product's value.
* **Flexibility:** I'm still open to negotiation but setting a clear lower limit, giving Bob a clear understanding of my boundaries."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and for coming down to $105. I'm still a bit hesitant, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $95. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  $95 is only $5 away from my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Limited Upside:** Further negotiation might not yield a significantly better price, and the risk of Bob backing out or John becoming unavailable increases with each round.
* **Time Efficiency:** Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a sale relatively quickly and avoid further back-and-forth negotiations."
