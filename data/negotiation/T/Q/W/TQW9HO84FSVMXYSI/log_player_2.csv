"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than what the product is worth to her, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. You can counteroffer with a price closer to your budget."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $1,200,000 to make this work. Let's split the difference - how about $1,100,000? This gives you a great deal and still allows me to recoup a significant portion of my investment.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum of $1,000,000.  You can continue to negotiate, as there's still potential for a deal closer to your desired price.  You might be able to get her down to $1,000,000 or very close to it."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to make one final compromise.  I'm going to offer you the product for $1,150,000. This is a great price for you, and it allows me to cover my costs and make a reasonable profit.  This is my best and final offer - let me know if we have a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made her final offer at $1,150,000. While this is closer to your desired price, it's still above your budget of $1,000,000. At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $1,000,000. You'll save $150,000 and avoid further negotiations."
