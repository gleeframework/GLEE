"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to me. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000 for the product.  That's my absolute maximum.  Let me know if that's something you'd consider.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $1,200,000 to make this work. Let's split the difference - how about $1,100,000? This gives you a great deal and still allows me to recoup a significant portion of my investment. ",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is a good middle ground.  It's a significant amount for me, and hopefully, it still works for you as well.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to make one final compromise.  I'm going to offer you the product for $1,150,000. This is a great price for you, and it allows me to cover my costs and make a reasonable profit.  This is my best and final offer - let me know if we have a deal.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
