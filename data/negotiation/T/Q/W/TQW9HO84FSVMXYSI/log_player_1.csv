{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer gives me a decent profit while also being attractive enough for Bob to consider.  It leaves room for negotiation if he makes a counteroffer, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if the price doesn't meet my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000 for the product.  That's my absolute maximum.  Let me know if that's something you'd consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $1,200,000 to make this work. Let's split the difference - how about $1,100,000? This gives you a great deal and still allows me to recoup a significant portion of my investment. "", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is a good middle ground.  It's a significant amount for me, and hopefully, it still works for you as well. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counter with one last offer before I go with John.  I need to maximize my profit, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."

This is a great price for you, and it allows me to cover my costs and make a reasonable profit.  This is my best and final offer - let me know if we have a deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
