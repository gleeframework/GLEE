"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for us to begin our discussion."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 
 
I am starting high to establish a strong anchor point and leave room for negotiation. I don't want to go too low too quickly, as I know the product is worth significantly more to me. However, the offer is still attractive enough to Bob, potentially saving him $100,000.  Let's see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum. While meeting ""halfway"" sounds appealing, it would be a substantial loss for me. I'll counter in the next round, aiming for a more reasonable price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product. However, $900,000 is quite a distance from what I had in mind.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the product's true worth and ensures a fairer outcome for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm:**  I'm reducing my price, but not drastically. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but not desperate to accept a low offer. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""fairer outcome,"" I subtly remind Bob that his initial offer was heavily skewed in his favor.
* **Strategic Positioning:** I'm aiming for a compromise within a range where I'm comfortable, rather than getting locked into a back-and-forth closer to Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise further and propose a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, which shows he's still very interested. However,  $950,000 is still too low for me. I need to hold firm and show him I'm willing to walk away if necessary. John's guaranteed offer is looking more and more appealing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our valuations remains substantial.  I'm willing to consider $1,025,000 as my final offer. However, I need to be upfront - if this doesn't work, I'm prepared to pursue other options for this product."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** I'm explicitly stating this is my ""final offer"" to create urgency and signal that I'm not willing to endlessly haggle.
* **Slight Concession:** I'm dropping the price slightly, but not significantly, to show I'm trying to find middle ground.
* **Alternative Option:**  Mentioning ""other options"" subtly reminds Bob that I have John's offer as a fallback and am not desperate to close a deal at any cost. 

This is a calculated risk. Bob might be willing to meet my price to avoid losing the deal. If not, I'm prepared to walk away and accept John's offer, ensuring I get my minimum valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm not comfortable going above $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a price of $975,000. I believe this is the highest I can go without compromising my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's clear that Bob is firm on his valuation, and further negotiation is unlikely to bridge the gap significantly. While $975,000 is a tempting offer, it's still substantially lower than both my minimum and John's guaranteed offer. 

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Bob. Accepting John's offer ensures I receive my desired value for the product without further risk or time investment."
