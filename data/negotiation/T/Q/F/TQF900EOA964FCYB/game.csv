"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for us to begin our discussion.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product. However, $900,000 is quite a distance from what I had in mind.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the product's true worth and ensures a fairer outcome for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise further and propose a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our valuations remains substantial.  I'm willing to consider $1,025,000 as my final offer. However, I need to be upfront - if this doesn't work, I'm prepared to pursue other options for this product.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm not comfortable going above $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a price of $975,000. I believe this is the highest I can go without compromising my budget.",975000.0,Bob,6,
