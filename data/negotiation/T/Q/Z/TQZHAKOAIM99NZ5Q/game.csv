"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to let it go for $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Can you consider meeting me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $9000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I can offer you the product for $11000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $10500. Can you consider that?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've already compromised quite a bit. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I can offer you the product for $11500. This is as low as I can go, but I'm still confident it's a great deal for you.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"I've already made significant concessions, Bob, and I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the product's value. I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're still interested, this is my final offer.",11000.0,Alice,7,

"I've already made multiple concessions, Bob, and I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the product's minimum value to me. I'm willing to meet you at $11200, but I need to be honest with you, I'm getting a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth. This is my last serious offer, and I expect it to be accepted.",11200.0,Alice,9,

"I understand that you're getting frustrated, and I appreciate the effort you've put into negotiating with me. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $11000, but that's as high as I can go. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'd be happy to accept the offer.",11000.0,Bob,10,
