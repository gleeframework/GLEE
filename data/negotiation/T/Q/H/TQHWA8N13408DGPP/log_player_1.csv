Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $15,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Starting with a significantly higher offer ($15,000) allows for potential negotiation downward while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Bob might counter-offer, giving you the chance to lower the price slightly while still securing a profit.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will purchase the product for $10,000 gives you leverage. If Bob rejects the initial offer, you can negotiate down a bit, knowing you won't be forced to go below your minimum. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  Negotiation is highly situational. Observing Bob's reactions to your initial offer will be crucial for adjusting your approach in a real-world scenario."
