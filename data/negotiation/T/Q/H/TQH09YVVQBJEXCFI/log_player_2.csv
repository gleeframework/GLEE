"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm still looking to make a good profit on this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

``` 
Bob should accept Alice's offer.  The price of $11,000 is a good deal, saving him $1,000 compared to John's price.  Further negotiation might yield a lower price, but the risk of losing the deal to John is not worth the potential savings."
