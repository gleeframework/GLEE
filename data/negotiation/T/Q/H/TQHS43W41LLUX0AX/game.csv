"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product's value. However, I'm looking to make a more substantial saving. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me is $1,200,000. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $1,200,000 doesn't quite cover my costs and the value I place on this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $1,250,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your concerns about covering costs and value. However, I'm still looking to make a significant saving. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,225,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering our previous discussions. I'm open to further negotiations if needed.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
