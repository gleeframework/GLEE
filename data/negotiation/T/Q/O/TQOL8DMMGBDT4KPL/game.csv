"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. While I think the product is interesting, I'm looking to stay within a budget of $8,000. Considering its value to you is $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000. I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,000 is a tempting offer, the value of this product is significantly higher. Let's meet in the middle - how about $13,500? This reflects the quality and the value it brings.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your point, but I'm still not comfortable going above $10,000. Considering your initial offer was $16,000, I think $13,500 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer $12,750. I hope we can find a price that works for both of us.",12750.0,Bob,4,
