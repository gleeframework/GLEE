"Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $115. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me halfway?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $105 is a good starting point, I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we split the difference and go with $110? That would be a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $108? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.,108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $109? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can avoid further negotiation.",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not comfortable with $109. Would you be willing to go down to $107? That's the best I can do.,107.0,Bob,6,
