Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're interested in the product, but I'm afraid $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $11500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.

Alice's offer:

Wait, I have an idea. I'll make one last counteroffer to try to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $11,000, and I'll also ask Alice to throw in some extras, like a free warranty or some additional training, to sweeten the deal.
