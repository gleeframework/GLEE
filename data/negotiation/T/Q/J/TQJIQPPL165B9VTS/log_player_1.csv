However, I need to be upfront â€“ while I value our discussions, $950,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I'm willing to accept a final offer of $975,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $975,000 is a compromise on your end, but I'm still not comfortable going above $950,000. I'm willing to make one final counteroffer of $955,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. If this is still not acceptable, I may need to consider purchasing from John for $800,000.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very unlikely to go above $955,000.  He's using John's offer as leverage, but his valuation of the product ($800,000) suggests he won't reach our minimum. Accepting his offer would mean losing a significant amount compared to John's guaranteed offer."
