Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm asking for $19,000, which reflects its true value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's value to Bob, you're providing a reason for the higher price, making it less likely to be immediately dismissed.
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  Phrases like ""What do you think?"" invite Bob to engage in a conversation and potentially make a counter-offer.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is extremely price-sensitive, you might want to adjust your initial offer slightly lower. 
* **Market Conditions:** If the product is in high demand and you have other potential buyers, you could be even more assertive with your pricing.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still maintaining a good chance of securing a deal with Bob. If he rejects the offer, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer at your minimum price."
