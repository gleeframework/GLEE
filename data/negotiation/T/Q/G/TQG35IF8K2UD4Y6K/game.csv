"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $775000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still not convinced that $775000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to go up to $760000, but I'd like to see if we can meet at that price. Can you consider it?",760000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your hesitation, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $760000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $765000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",765000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, Alice. However, I'm still not convinced that $765000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $760000, but I'd like to throw in a condition: I'd like to negotiate the payment terms. Can you consider a 10% deposit upfront and the remaining balance due in 30 days? Can you meet me at $760000 with this payment structure?",760000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your request, Bob, and I'm willing to consider the payment terms. However, I'm not comfortable with the 10% deposit upfront and 30-day payment structure. I'm willing to offer a 5% deposit upfront and 60-day payment terms. This is a compromise, and I believe it's a fair deal. I'm still willing to sell the product to you for $760000. What do you think?",760000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise on the payment terms, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with a 5% deposit. I'd like to propose a 3% deposit upfront and 60-day payment terms.
