I'm not willing to sell the product for $75, as it's worth at least $80 to me. I'll try to get a better offer from Bob in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $85?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth the price."", ""product_price"": 85}

While $78 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
