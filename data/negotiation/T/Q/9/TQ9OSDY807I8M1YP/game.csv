"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $22,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000, which is still a good deal for you.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $19,000? This reflects the product's true value.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $19,000 is still a bit steep. How about $16,000? This is a good middle ground, and I'm confident we can find common ground.",16000.0,Bob,4,
