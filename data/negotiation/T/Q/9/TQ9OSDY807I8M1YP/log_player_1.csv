"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I'm asking for $22,000 to start.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you seem more flexible as you come down. 
* **Anchoring:**  By starting high, you ""anchor"" the negotiation at a higher point, potentially influencing Bob to make counteroffers closer to your target price.
* **Testing the Waters:** This first offer helps gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $22,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000, which is still a good deal for you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Bob's counter-offer suggests he's interested and willing to negotiate. I'll reject this offer to see if I can push for a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $19,000? This reflects the product's true value."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (Appearing Flexible):** I'm coming down significantly from my initial offer to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Still Above Target:**  My new price of $19,000 leaves room for further negotiation while keeping me well above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""true value,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth and trying to steer him away from focusing solely on his budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $19,000 is still a bit steep. How about $16,000? This is a good middle ground, and I'm confident we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $16,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Good Deal:**  While I could try to push for more, there's a risk Bob might walk away. $16,000 represents a strong profit, and it's best to secure a good deal rather than risk losing the sale entirely."
