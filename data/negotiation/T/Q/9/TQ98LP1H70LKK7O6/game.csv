"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm aiming to stay within a budget of $800,000. Would you be willing to consider a price of $825,000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while allowing us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",825000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $825,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still not quite there. To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial arrangement. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
