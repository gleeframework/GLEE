"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to go down to $90?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  How about $100?  That's a fair price and it would allow me to get the product I need.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob! However, I'm not willing to give up too much profit. How about we compromise at $105? It's still a great deal for you, and I'll make a bit more profit than at $100.",105.0,Alice,5,
