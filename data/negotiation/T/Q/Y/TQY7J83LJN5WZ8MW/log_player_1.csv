"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  I'm confident that Bob might be willing to negotiate down from this price, as the product is worth $80 to him. If he rejects this offer, I'll see what his counteroffer is.  I'm prepared to negotiate, but I'm also aware that I have the option of selling to John for $100 if things don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $95 is a good price, I'm aiming for a higher profit. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price in the next round. I'm also aware of the option to sell to John for $100, so I'm not under any pressure to accept a price that I'm not happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $105. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a good price for me, and I think it's a reasonable offer that Bob might accept. I'm aware that I have the option to sell to John for $100, but I'd rather get a slightly better price from Bob if possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $92 is a decent price, I'm not going to settle for anything lower than $100.  I have a guaranteed sale to John at that price, and I'm willing to take the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob.  I believe I can get a better price from him, and I'm willing to keep trying."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $100.  This is my floor price, and I'm not willing to go any lower.  I'm hoping Bob will finally accept, as this is a good price for him, and it's a good profit for me.  I'm also aware of the option to sell to John for $100, so I'm not taking any risks by holding firm on this price."
