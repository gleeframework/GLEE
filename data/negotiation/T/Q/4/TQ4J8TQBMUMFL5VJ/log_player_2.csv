(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $8,000 for the product. Alice's offer is $8,000, which is your maximum price. However, you have a guaranteed alternative with John who will sell the product for the same price.  Rejecting Alice's offer keeps your options open and doesn't cost you anything."
