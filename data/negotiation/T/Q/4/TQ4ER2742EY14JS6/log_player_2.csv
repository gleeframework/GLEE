"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is tailored to meet your specific needs. We believe it's a perfect match for you. Considering its value and benefits, we're offering it to you for $16,000. This special price includes a comprehensive warranty and personalized support for the first year. Let's make this a win-win situation! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. While the product might be good, there's room for negotiation. You can try to get a lower price from Alice before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. The product looks great, but $16,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower offer ($12,000) leaves room for negotiation. It also signals that you're serious about buying but looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. After careful consideration, I understand your position. To find a middle ground, I am willing to offer the product to you for $14,000. This still includes the comprehensive warranty and personalized support for the first year. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, which is a good sign. However, the price is still above your ideal budget.  You have room to negotiate further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $14,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $13,000. Would that price work for you?"",
""product_price"": 13000
}
```

**Reasoning:** You're incrementally increasing your offer to show Alice you're willing to negotiate but holding firm to stay within your budget. This counter-offer keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a significant discount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. In an effort to reach an agreement, I am willing to consider $13,500 as the final price for the product. This still includes all the benefits you've been looking for. I hope this offer aligns better with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer and is now only $500 above John's price. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and further negotiation might make you lose the deal entirely. This offer represents a good balance between getting a discount and securing the product."
