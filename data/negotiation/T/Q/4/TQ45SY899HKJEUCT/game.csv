"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your desire to find a good deal. While $900,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is my final offer, as I'm confident I can find other buyers at this price point if needed.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Considering your previous offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to move forward with the deal if you're willing to accept this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still significantly below my bottom line. I can do $1,000,000, and that's my absolute final offer.  I need to respect the value of this product.  If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
