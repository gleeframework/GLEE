"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is too high for me.  How about we settle around $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $11,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about we split the difference at $12,500?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $12,500 is still a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. Would $11,750 work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $11,750 is a good deal and getting closer to my goal.  Continuing to negotiate risks the possibility of him walking away and me having to sell to John for a lower price."
