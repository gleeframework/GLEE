Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be interested in.  I'm asking $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is closer to my ideal price than the floor of $80. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:**  Using a friendly tone (""I think you'll be interested"") helps build rapport and makes Bob more likely to consider the offer.
* **Open-Ended Question:** Asking ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation rather than just accepting or rejecting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a nice product, but $100 feels a bit high for me.  Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher Value for Bob:** Bob is willing to pay $120 for the product, so $85 is still a good deal for him. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Rejecting his offer leaves room for me to potentially secure a price closer to my desired $100.
* **Potential Counteroffer:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer closer to my asking price. 

I'm not willing to sell the product to John for $80 yet, as there's still a chance to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm counteroffering at $92.50, which is the midpoint between my initial offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $85. 
* **Motivating Language:** I'm using positive language (""Let's get this deal done!"") to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Appeal to Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a compromise (""split the difference"") to make it seem reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Bob has come up to $90, which is very close to my desired price. 
* **Avoiding Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to further back and forth, potentially lowering the price or wasting time.  
* **Minimizing Risk:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at a price above my minimum floor of $80.

While I'd ideally like $92.50, the risk of Bob rejecting my counteroffer and potentially lowering his offer further is not worth it.  It's better to secure a good deal at $90."
