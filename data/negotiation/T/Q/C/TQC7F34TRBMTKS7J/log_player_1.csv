{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential return on investment for someone with your insights. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Alice knows the product's worth much less to Bob, but she starts significantly higher than his valuation. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a price closer to her own valuation.
* **Justification and Value Emphasis:**  Instead of a blunt offer, Alice highlights the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value proposition."" This framing attempts to justify the high price and shift Bob's focus towards potential gains.
* **Open for Negotiation:** By asking for Bob's thoughts, Alice invites negotiation. This allows her to gauge his interest and adjust her strategy if needed. 

**Strategy:**

Alice is using a combination of anchoring and value-based pricing. By anchoring the initial price high, she aims to influence Bob's perception of the product's value. If Bob negotiates, Alice can gradually reduce the price, knowing she has John as a guaranteed buyer at her minimum acceptable price."
