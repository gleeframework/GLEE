Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to counter with a slightly lower price, but still aiming for the highest possible profit.  I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,300,000 is a good price, I believe I can still get closer to my desired value.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm countering with $1,400,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility. I'm aiming for a price that's attractive to Bob while still leaving me with a significant profit.  I'm confident that this counteroffer will get us closer to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $1,350,000 is a very good price, and it's getting close to my desired value.  While I could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob will walk away or that I'll end up selling to John for less.  This offer secures a good profit and minimizes the risk."
