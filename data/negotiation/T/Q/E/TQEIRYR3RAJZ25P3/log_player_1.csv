Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **Above your minimum:**  It's higher than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000, so you'd still make a profit.
* **Room for negotiation:** It leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to haggle.  
* **Testing the market:** It allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay more.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's perceived value:** You don't know what Bob thinks the product is worth. If he believes it's worth significantly less than $15,000, he'll likely reject the offer. 
* **Your risk tolerance:** If you're very confident in the product's value, you might consider a higher starting price. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Observe Bob's response:**  If he rejects, you can always lower your offer slightly or stick to the $12,000 with John. 
* **Be prepared to negotiate:** If Bob accepts, you may want to see if he's willing to pay a little more."
