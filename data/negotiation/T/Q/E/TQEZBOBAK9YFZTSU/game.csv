"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I'm on a tight budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit below what I need.  How about we split the difference and settle on $950,000? This would allow me to move forward with the sale and still give you a good deal considering the value you place on the product.  Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
