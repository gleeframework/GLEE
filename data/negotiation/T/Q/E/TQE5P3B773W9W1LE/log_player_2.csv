The product is worth no more than $80 to Bob.  Alice's offer is too high.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but $80 is a bit low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $110. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob is still aiming for a price below $80. While Alice's offer is a slight improvement, it's still above his maximum. Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $110 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we settle on $90? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're still in negotiations, Bob! However, $90 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $110, so I'll offer you $100. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has reached a point where he needs to decide whether to continue negotiating with Alice or go with John's offer. While Alice's offer of $100 is closer to Bob's target price, it's still above his maximum of $80. To avoid further negotiation and ensure he gets the product within his budget, Bob should choose to buy from John for $80."
