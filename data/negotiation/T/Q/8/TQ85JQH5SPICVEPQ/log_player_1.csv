Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I know it's valuable to you and believe this is a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $140 allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Ensure a Good Deal:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, selling to John at $120 still ensures a profit."
