"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the value to me and the potential for negotiation, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  Considering its potential for your business, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe we can finalize the deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $925,000?  This would be a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",925000.0,Bob,4,
