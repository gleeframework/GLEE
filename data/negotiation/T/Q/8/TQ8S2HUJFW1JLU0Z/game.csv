"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to my business, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I could do  $600,000.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about budget, but I still believe my product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you is $800,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $900,000 is still too high for me. I'm serious about buying this product, but I have a limit. I can do $700,000.  That's my best and final offer.  If we can't make a deal here, I'll have to explore other options.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell at $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $850,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're interested, please let me know.",850000.0,Alice,5,
