"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,100,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  I believe this price reflects the true value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $2,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000.  This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
