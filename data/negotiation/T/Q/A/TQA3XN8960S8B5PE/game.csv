"I understand you're willing to go up to $1050000, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at that price yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I get a better deal. I'm now offering the product to you for $1250000. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
