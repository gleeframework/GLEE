"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $9000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $9000. How about we meet at $7500? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $7500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8500, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in that.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $8500 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we meet at $7000? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",7000.0,Bob,6,
