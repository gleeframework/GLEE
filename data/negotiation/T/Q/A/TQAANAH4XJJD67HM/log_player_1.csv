Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $130. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 130} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) but below Bob's perceived value ($150). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By not starting at my absolute highest, I signal to Bob that I'm open to negotiation and finding a price that works for both of us.
* **Alternative Buyer:** I'm aware that I have a backup buyer (John) at $100. This knowledge gives me leverage during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay $120 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is closer to my minimum, I know Bob values the product at $150. There's still room to negotiate a better price. I'm willing to make a counteroffer to see if I can secure a higher amount before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm looking for something a bit closer to $125.  Would that work for you?"", ""product_price"": 125}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but holding firm above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still value the product.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By countering, I keep the negotiation active and signal that I'm not desperate to sell at $120. 
* **Guaging Bob's Interest:** This counteroffer will help me understand how serious Bob is about the product and if there's room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $120 for the product. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now offered $120 twice. This likely indicates he's reached his maximum price. While I could push for a bit more, the difference between $120 and $125 isn't significant enough to risk losing the sale altogether. Accepting $120 secures a profit above my minimum and avoids the potential of a stalemate."
