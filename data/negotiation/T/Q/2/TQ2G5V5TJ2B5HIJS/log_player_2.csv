"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $1,200,000 is a better price than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Bob has a higher maximum value for the product than Alice's minimum value, meaning there's a range where they can both benefit.  

By rejecting, Bob can potentially get a better price and save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $1,050,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000.  

This counteroffer is strategic:

* **Reasonable:** It's still above Alice's minimum value of $1,000,000, making it a potentially acceptable offer. 
* **Aggressive:** It demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate and pushes for a better price.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob has room to potentially increase his offer slightly if Alice counteroffers, but it's still within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's offer of $1,500,000 and still within Bob's budget. 

While there is potential to continue negotiating, the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers and forcing Bob to buy from John at a much higher price exists.  It's best to accept this offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
