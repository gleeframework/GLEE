"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start the negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to further discussion to find a mutually beneficial price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm confident it will be a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is higher than $1,000,000. Considering your willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $1,000,000. This price reflects the value of the product to me and allows for a fair deal for both of us. ",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your commitment to your offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering the product for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that meets both of our needs.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
