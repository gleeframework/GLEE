Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is higher than $1,000,000. Considering your willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your commitment to your offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering the product for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that meets both of our needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Since Alice has declared this her final offer, continuing to negotiate is unlikely to yield a better price. It's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $1,000,000 to secure the deal within your budget."
