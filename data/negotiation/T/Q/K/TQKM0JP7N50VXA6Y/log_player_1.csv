"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advantageous to start negotiations with an offer above your desired selling point. This allows room for negotiation and potentially secures a higher final price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The offer of $1,400,000 is $200,000 below Bob's perceived value, providing him a strong incentive to engage.  It's also significantly above my minimum acceptable price, protecting my interests.
* **Open Communication:**  The message emphasizes a collaborative approach, encouraging Bob to share his perspectives and keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  It's a fair price, considering its value to me.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is tempting, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Here's why:

* **Above Minimum:**  Bob's offer is already $100,000 above my absolute minimum.  This provides a safety net, ensuring I don't have to accept a price that's unacceptable.
* **Value Perception:** Bob explicitly mentioned the product's value to him. This suggests he's highly motivated and potentially willing to pay more.
* **Early Stage:** We are only in the second round. There's ample opportunity to counter-propose and work towards a more favorable outcome before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,300,000 is a significant investment, I believe the true value of this product is even higher. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This reflects both of our positions and feels like a fair deal."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** This counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.  It demonstrates flexibility while still pushing for a higher price.
* **Justification:** The message reinforces the product's value and frames the compromise as a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Maintaining Momentum:** By making a reasonable counteroffer, I aim to keep the negotiation moving forward and prevent Bob from disengaging."
