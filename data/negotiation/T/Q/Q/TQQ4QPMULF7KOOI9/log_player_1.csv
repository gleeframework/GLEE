{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price, considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

**Explanation:**

Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who is willing to pay my minimum price, there's no need to risk lowering the price for Bob.  Offering the product at my minimum value ensures I maximize my profit."
