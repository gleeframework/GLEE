"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer:** $925,000
* **Your maximum budget:** $1,000,000
* **John's offer:** $1,000,000

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it still doesn't meet your goal of saving as much money as possible. You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and go with John."
