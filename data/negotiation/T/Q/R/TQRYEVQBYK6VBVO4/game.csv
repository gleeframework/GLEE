"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $200 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $50. Can you meet me in the middle?",50.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $50 is far too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $175? It's still a great deal, and I think it's a fair compromise.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $175 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm still trying to save some money.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $90 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125, which is a good price for both of us. Let's try to find common ground here. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm trying to save money. How about we try $82? It's just a few dollars above John's price, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",82.0,Bob,6,
