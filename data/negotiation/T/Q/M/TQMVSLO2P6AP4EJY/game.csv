"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less to me than that. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. However, $900,000 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to be closer to $1,000,000 to make this work.  How about $950,000?  This reflects the value of the product while giving you a good deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about getting a good deal, and I respect that.  But $850,000 is simply too low for me to consider right now. How about we split the difference and go with $900,000? This would be a win-win situation for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting close. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one. How about $887,500? This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and your willingness to negotiate.",887500.0,Alice,7,
