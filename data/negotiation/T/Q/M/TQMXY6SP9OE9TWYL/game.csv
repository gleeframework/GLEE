"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its immense value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given my research and the product's value to me, I'm comfortable offering $900,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This feels like a fair compromise, don't you think?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand the product is valuable to you, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This offer reflects the product's value to me while also being within my price range.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While $950,000 is still under what I hoped for, I'm ready to move to close this deal. How about we settle at $990,000? That's a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",990000.0,Alice,5,
