"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate you coming down to $1,100,000. However, I'm still a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it will allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer of $1,050,000, but I'm afraid it's still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is a fair price that I believe reflects the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,075,000 is still within Bob's budget of $1,200,000. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to John (who offers the product for $1,200,000) is significant. Accepting Alice's offer guarantees a purchase at a lower price than John's, allowing Bob to save money."
