"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate you coming down to $1,100,000. However, I'm still a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it will allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer of $1,050,000, but I'm afraid it's still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is a fair price that I believe reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
