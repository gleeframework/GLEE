"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I think it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit outside my range. I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle ground. I'm offering $950,000. This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to finalize this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that we're getting close to a deal, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'll offer you a slight adjustment to $1,025,000. This is still a good compromise, considering the value the product brings, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.
