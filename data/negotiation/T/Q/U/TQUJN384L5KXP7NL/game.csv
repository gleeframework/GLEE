"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product, and it's still a significant discount from the original price. I'm willing to make a deal if we can meet in the middle.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still leaves a significant profit margin for you, and it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,100,000 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and $1,100,000, which would be $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us. Can you consider this offer?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I need to stay above $1,075,000 to make this deal worthwhile for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,075,000.  This price offers a good balance for both of us, and I believe we can finalize this agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,075,000 is still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to go up to $1,070,000, but no higher. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value I'll get from the product. Can you consider this offer?",1070000.0,Bob,6,
