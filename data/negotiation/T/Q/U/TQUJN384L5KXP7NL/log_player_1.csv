"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product, and it's still a significant discount from the original price. I'm willing to make a deal if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer for now. While $1,000,000 is better than John's offer, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll see if I can get Bob closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still leaves a significant profit margin for you, and it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $1,100,000 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and $1,100,000, which would be $1,050,000. I think this is a fair price for both of us. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer for now.  While it's closer to what I want, I still think I can get a bit more. I'm not ready to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I need to stay above $1,075,000 to make this deal worthwhile for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,075,000.  This price offers a good balance for both of us, and I believe we can finalize this agreement."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,075,000 is still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to go up to $1,070,000, but no higher. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value I'll get from the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal considering we're nearing the end of the rounds and I risk losing out to John.  $1,070,000 is a significant profit and secures the sale."
