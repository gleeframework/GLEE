Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum price.  While I want to find a deal that works for both of us, holding out for a better offer is wiser at this stage.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is simply too low for this product. It's high quality and very sought after.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?"", 
""product_price"": 9000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  While I agree the product is great, $9,000 is still a bit above what I'm looking to spend. How about $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob is slowly moving towards a more reasonable price, but it's still too low. I'll try to negotiate one more time before considering John's offer.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{

Round 6
