"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident it's even more valuable to you.  I'm starting with an offer of $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts high, acknowledging the value of the product to both of you. It's a good starting point for negotiation, and leaves room to lower the price if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm not going to give up the potential for a higher price just yet. Bob's offer is low, but he's shown interest. I'll counter with a higher price and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is still a good deal for you, considering the value you've placed on the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $8,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has come up to $8,500, which is closer to my desired price point. While I'd prefer more, it's getting late in the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  It's a good deal for both of us, and I'd rather close the sale now than gamble with John's offer."
