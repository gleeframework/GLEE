"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's a valuable asset that could be a game-changer for your business. I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,400,000 is still outside my budget. To make this work, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price considering my needs and the value I see in the product. I'm confident this is a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. It's worth risking a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I also haven't exhausted all my negotiation options yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints. However, $850,000 is simply too low for me.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This still reflects the significant value of the product and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is still outside my budget. To make this work, I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is increasing his offer, it's still significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm not desperate, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate. I'm also aware that John is a reliable backup buyer, so I'm not under immense pressure to accept a low offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. While $950,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still not in the range I need to make this deal work.  To keep moving forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows both of us to benefit.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a profitable deal for both of us.  I hope we can finalize this agreement soon. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is inching closer, but $1,000,000 is still far from my desired price. There are only 4 rounds left, so I need to be more aggressive in my counteroffers. I'm confident that I can get a better deal, and I'm not willing to settle for a significant loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  $1,000,000 is still too low for me. To close this deal, I need to be at $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident that this will be a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm trying to be as fair as possible. I can't go any higher than $975,000.  This is my final offer. If we can't agree, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the wire with only two rounds left.  While Bob's offer is a bit higher, it's still not close to my target. I'm confident that John will buy the product for a much higher price.  Selling to John guarantees me a significant profit, and I don't want to risk losing out on that opportunity."
