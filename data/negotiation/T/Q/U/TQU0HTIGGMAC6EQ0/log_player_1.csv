Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000, but leaves some room for negotiation. It also positions me closer to my desired $15,000 target. 

This offer sets the stage for negotiation. By offering a price that is not immediately acceptable to Bob, but not outrageous, I can encourage him to make a counteroffer. This gives me the opportunity to gauge his interest and potentially work towards a mutually agreeable price.  

I'm also keeping in mind the possibility of selling to John for $15,000, so I won't be afraid to walk away from the deal if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still significantly lower than my desired price and my minimum value of $15,000.  While it's tempting to accept, I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a more favorable outcome. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price to $11,000.  This shows flexibility while still staying above Bob's last offer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that satisfies both of us. This price also gives me a good buffer in case I need to lower it further, but still keeps me closer to my desired $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $10,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly less than my minimum value of $15,000. I believe I can still do better and reach a price closer to my desired outcome. I'm confident in my product's value and will continue to negotiate with Bob, as he's clearly interested in the product and willing to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering $10,500, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's latest one. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while also staying above Bob's offer.  This counteroffer is a strategic move, aiming for a quick agreement while keeping me closer to my desired price. If Bob is serious about buying the product, I believe he will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd like to get closer to my ideal price, Bob's offer of $9,800 is getting too close to his perceived value of $8,000. Further negotiation might only lead to more rounds of back and forth with no guarantee of a significantly higher price. Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $15,000, it's in my best interest to sell to him and secure the highest possible profit."
