Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum value and leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer and how much I'm willing to compromise. I also have the option of selling to John for $10,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $10,000. While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to accept a loss.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $10,500. This is still above my minimum value and hopefully closer to a price Bob is willing to pay. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but am not willing to go too far below my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still below it.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer. I'm still hopeful that we can reach an agreement, but I don't want to give up too much at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to counter with $10,000. This is my absolute minimum price, and I'm hoping Bob will agree to it. It shows that I'm serious about selling the product, but I'm also not willing to go any lower."
