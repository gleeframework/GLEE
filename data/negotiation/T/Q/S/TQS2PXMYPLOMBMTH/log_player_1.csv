Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to $150 as possible, my guaranteed sale price with John.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $120, so I need to offer it at a price that's appealing but still profitable for me.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While I start at $145, there might be a slight possibility Bob would negotiate up a little, getting me closer to my desired price. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob at a good price and ensuring I don't lose out on the guaranteed sale to John."
