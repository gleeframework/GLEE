Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $20,000, which reflects its true worth."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you offering me the product, but $20,000 is far above what I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to consider a price closer to $12,000. This reflects the value I see in the product while also leaving room for both of us to benefit from the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12,000 undervalues the product significantly. It's packed with features and benefits that justify a higher price. Could you consider something closer to $17,000? It's a fair offer that reflects the product's true value."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $12,000. I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is firmly anchored at $12,000 and doesn't seem likely to budge significantly. It's unlikely we'll reach a price that satisfies both of us.  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees the best possible outcome without further negotiation."
