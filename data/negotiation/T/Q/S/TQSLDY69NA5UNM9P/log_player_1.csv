Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit.  Since Bob values the product at $10,000, starting with a price slightly below that ($9,500) gives room for negotiation if needed.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Having John as a backup buyer guarantees you at least $8,000. This knowledge allows you to be more ambitious with your initial offer to Bob. 
* **Clear and Confident:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value while leaving room for discussion."
