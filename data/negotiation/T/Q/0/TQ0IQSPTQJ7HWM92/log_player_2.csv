"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by many satisfied customers. Given its quality and features, it's worth $150 to me, but considering your appreciation for it, I believe we can come to a fair agreement. I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. This price not only reflects its value but also allows us both to benefit. Please let me know if this offer suits you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $120 is lower than her stated value, you know you can get the product for $100 from John.  Rejecting this offer opens the possibility of a better counter-offer from Alice, or you can always purchase from John at your target price."
