{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $900,000, knowing it's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room:**  This price allows for potential compromise and counteroffers while still ensuring a significant profit for me.
* **Setting the Stage:** The message emphasizes fairness and invites Bob to engage in a conversation. 

I'm confident that this initial offer will open a dialogue and increase the chances of a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss. 
* **Negotiation is Still Possible:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, it shows his willingness to negotiate.  I believe there's still potential to reach a more favorable agreement. 
* **Protecting My Interests:** Selling to John immediately would guarantee $1,000,000, but I'm not willing to abandon the possibility of a better deal with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer and counter-offering, I can continue the negotiation and try to achieve a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, $700,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a significant profit for you.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I've moved closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still protecting my minimum profit.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I emphasize the profit Bob can still make, hoping to incentivize him to accept.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains positive and encourages further negotiation, aiming for a mutually beneficial outcome.

This counteroffer balances my need for a decent profit with the desire to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $775,000. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Further Negotiation:** I believe there's still potential to push for a higher price. Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and I'm not ready to settle for a loss.
* **Risking John's Offer:** Selling to John would guarantee a significant profit, but I'm still optimistic about getting a better deal with Bob.

I'll counter Bob's offer, hoping to inch closer to a price that meets my minimum requirement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  While $775,000 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers, offering $812,500.  This price still allows you a healthy profit, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product.  Let's seal the deal!"", ""product_price"": 812500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Incentive:**  I'm offering a price that's the midpoint between our last offers, showing flexibility while still keeping my profit.
* **Highlighting Mutual Benefit:** I emphasize the profit Bob will still make, hoping to encourage him to accept.
* **Closing the Deal:**  The message is positive and optimistic, aimed at closing the deal and avoiding further rounds of negotiation. 

This counteroffer represents a significant compromise from my perspective, while still ensuring I don't settle for a loss. I'm hopeful that this offer will convince Bob to accept and finalize the transaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $812,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the price I was initially considering for the product from John. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting the Minimum:** Bob's offer of $800,000 finally reaches my minimum acceptable price. While it's not ideal, it's a significant profit for me and avoids further negotiation.
* **Avoiding Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate risks Bob backing out entirely or my patience wearing thin, leading me to sell to John at a lower price.
* **Finalizing the Deal:**  Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a sale and move on, minimizing the potential for further delays or complications.

While I'd prefer a higher price, the risk of losing the deal altogether and settling for John's $1,000,000 offer outweighs the potential benefits of further negotiation."
