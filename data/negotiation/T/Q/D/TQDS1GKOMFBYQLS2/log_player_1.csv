Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000, which is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000), making it likely he'll consider it. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and optimistic, emphasizing the mutual benefit of the deal. 
* **Negotiation:**  I'm leaving room for negotiation, understanding that Bob might counter-offer. I'm prepared to go back and forth until we reach an agreement that's fair for both of us. 
* **Plan B:** I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiations with Bob fall apart. This acts as a safety net and allows me to be more assertive in my negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is still a good profit for me, it's significantly lower than my initial offer and my minimum desired value of $1,000,000. I'm willing to try and get closer to my desired price. 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter-offer with a price closer to my original offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down to $1,100,000, but I can't go that low just yet. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?  It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this quickly."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm countering with $1,250,000, which is a compromise between my original offer and Bob's counter-offer.  
* **Message:** The message remains positive and emphasizes the mutually beneficial aspect of the deal. I'm also trying to create a sense of urgency by saying I'm confident we can finalize the deal quickly.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  By moving slightly closer to Bob's price, I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining my desire to get a price closer to my original offer. 
* **Plan B:**  I'm still keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net, which allows me to be more assertive in my negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're not ready to go as low as $1,100,000 yet. Let's try to make this work. Would you consider $1,175,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,175,000 is getting closer to my desired price and significantly higher than John's offer.  While I would have preferred to get closer to $1,250,000, accepting this offer ensures a good profit for me and avoids the risk of further negotiations potentially breaking down."
