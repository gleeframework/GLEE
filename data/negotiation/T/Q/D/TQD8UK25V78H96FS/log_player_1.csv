"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80 but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product. 
* **Open-Ended Question:** I leave the door open for Bob to negotiate and allows him to feel like he has some control."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal is to maximize profit:**  While $100 is better than $80, I still have room to negotiate and get closer to the $150 value the product holds for Bob. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows that I'm not desperate for a quick sale and am willing to hold out for a better price. 
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $100 is a little lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'm aiming for a price closer to the middle ground between my minimum and Bob's perceived value.
* **Appeal to Value:** I reiterate the value of the product and highlight the ""great deal"" aspect for Bob.
* **Building Momentum:** By showing willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a higher price, I'm building momentum toward a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Goal:**  $105 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 6 rounds remaining, the risk of continued negotiation is high. 
* **Potential for Future Deals:** Even if I could negotiate a slightly higher price, the time and effort might not be worth it, especially if I could potentially make a future deal with Bob for another product."
