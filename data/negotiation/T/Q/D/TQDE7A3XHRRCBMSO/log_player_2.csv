"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than $12,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'm interested in your product, and I'm willing to offer $10,500. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I believe the value of this product is closer to my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $1,000 lower than John's price:** This is a significant saving for Bob.
* **Meeting in the middle is a reasonable compromise:**  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal altogether by pushing too hard exists.  
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing to negotiate could take longer, and Bob might lose the opportunity to buy from Alice if he waits too long."
