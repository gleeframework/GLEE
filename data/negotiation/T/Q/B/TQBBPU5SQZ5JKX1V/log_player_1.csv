"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows me to make a decent profit while still providing you with a significant value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. This is a fair price that allows you to make a profit while giving me a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is better than selling to John, I'm confident that I can get a better price.  Bob clearly values the product at $12,000, so there's room for negotiation.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to $10,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  How about $10,500?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a profit that reflects the value of the product.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to maximize your profit, but $10500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has come up to $10,000, which is very close to my desired price.  I could try to negotiate further, but there's a risk he'll reject my offer, or we'll reach an impasse.  Selling for $10,000 is a good outcome, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
