"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows me to make a decent profit while still providing you with a significant value.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a better deal than $12,000, Bob can likely get a lower price by negotiating. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price that allows you to make a profit while giving me a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  How about $10500?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a profit that reflects the value of the product.  Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While $10,500 is better than $11,000, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to drive the price down further in subsequent rounds."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
