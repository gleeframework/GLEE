"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Its value is immense and I believe it will be a game-changer for you.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,800,000 is far too high, and he can likely get a better deal through negotiation or by buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is significantly higher than what I'm comfortable with.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a win-win for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is a strong offer, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This reflects the considerable value it will bring to your operations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,600,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still too high for Bob. He should continue negotiating to get a lower price.  There's a good chance he can get closer to his target price or even secure a better deal than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still above my budget.  I'm confident we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. This reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a reasonable price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's make this happen. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. I believe this is my final offer, reflecting the product's significant value and my desire to see it put to good use. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and this is a good opportunity for Bob to secure the product at a reasonable price.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or that he'll lose the opportunity altogether. At $1,500,000, he's still getting a good deal, and it's likely that he'll be able to make a profit on the product, making it a worthwhile investment."
