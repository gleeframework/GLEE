"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $135.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($120) but lower than my minimum ($150). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product and framing it as a good deal. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm not being rigid with the price and am inviting Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $120 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I won't accept it.
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get a price closer to my minimum. 
* **John is a Safety Net:**  I have the option of selling to John for $150 if negotiations with Bob fail. This provides a strong fallback position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $125. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing willingness to negotiate by reducing my price from $135 to $125.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm still emphasizing the value of the product to justify the price. 
* **Clear Goal:** I'm stating my price point directly and giving Bob a clear decision to make."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate it, but I still believe we can find a price that suits both of us. Would you consider selling the product for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Persistence:** Bob is stubbornly sticking to his initial offer of $120.
* **My Minimum:**  I'm still committed to my minimum price of $150.
* **Counteroffer Opportunity:** Rejecting Bob's offer again keeps the negotiation open and allows me to make another counteroffer. 
* **John is Always There:**  The option to sell to John for $150 provides a safety net if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but I'm not willing to go lower than $125. This is a fair price for the product, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Standing Firm:**  I'm sticking to my previous counteroffer of $125, demonstrating my willingness to compromise but also my resolve.
* **Reiteration of Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price. 
* **Closing Statement:**  I'm using language that encourages Bob to agree, highlighting the fairness of the price and suggesting a potential close."
