"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly below Bob's perceived value, hoping to entice him into accepting the deal quickly. I'll be prepared to negotiate further if he rejects, but I want to see if I can close this deal right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $13,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm offering $14,000, which is a bit higher than Bob's last offer, but still below my ideal price. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,200 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I want to try to push for a higher price, so I'm going to reject and see if I can get closer to my goal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13750}
```

I'm offering $13,750, which is a midpoint between Bob's last offer and my desired outcome. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a better price than $13,200."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $13,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  With only 4 rounds left, it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers.  This is a good deal, and I'm going to accept it."
