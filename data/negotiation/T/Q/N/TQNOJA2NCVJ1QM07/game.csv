"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $1,400,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial price, but I need to ensure I receive a fair return. Let's meet in the middle at $1,600,000. This would allow us both to benefit from the deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I respect the value you place on the product, I still feel that $1,600,000 is beyond my budget. I would like to suggest a price of $1,550,000. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both parties.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
