"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, and hopefully, it will pique Bob's interest. It's also significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, leaving me with a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but I'm not ready to accept it yet. I believe I can still get a better price. I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}

I'm going to counter with $1,900,000. This is still a good profit margin for me, and it's closer to Bob's offer, showing him that I'm willing to negotiate."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to settle for that price. I'm confident I can get a better deal, so I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to come up further."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1775000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,775,000. This is a smaller step than my previous counteroffer, showing that I'm getting closer to accepting his offer. It also gives Bob some room to negotiate without feeling like he has to concede too much."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,725,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

With only two rounds remaining, I need to be realistic. Bob's offer of $1,725,000 is only $25,000 less than my last counteroffer, and it's significantly above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm accepting his offer to avoid the risk of losing the deal altogether and ending up with only $1,500,000 from John."
