Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $10,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $7,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This product truly delivers exceptional value, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is not showing willingness to meet near my minimum price. It's becoming less likely he'll suddenly jump up to a reasonable offer.  I'd rather take the guaranteed $8,000 from John than risk getting stuck in a protracted negotiation."
