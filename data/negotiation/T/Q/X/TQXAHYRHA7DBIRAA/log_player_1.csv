Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

This offer is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves some room for negotiation if he's interested. It also allows me to quickly sell to John for my desired price if Bob isn't willing to meet halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to sell for less than my minimum value of $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show flexibility, but I'm still holding out for a significant profit. This price is a good midpoint between my minimum value and Bob's offer."
