Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's highly valuable to you, and I'm confident we can agree on a price that benefits us both. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a fair offer considering its potential value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You have valuable information â€“ Bob values the product at $1,500,000. This gives you significant leverage.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring you get a price significantly higher than your minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Highlighting Value to Bob:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly reminding him of its worth and why he'd be willing to pay a premium.
* **John as a Safety Net:** You have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 from John, ensuring you don't lose out completely if Bob declines.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit by aiming high while still presenting a compelling offer to Bob."
