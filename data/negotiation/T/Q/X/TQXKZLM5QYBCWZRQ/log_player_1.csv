"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay this price, but I'm prepared to negotiate if he's not."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $70. It's below my minimum value of $80, so I'm not willing to sell at that price. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm offering Bob $85, which is still higher than my minimum value but closer to his offer. I'm hoping this will be a good compromise and that Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum value, so I will accept it.  It's not ideal, but I'm satisfied with this outcome.  I don't want to risk losing the sale and getting only $80 from John if I keep negotiating."
