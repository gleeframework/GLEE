Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, and it reflects the fact that the product is worth at least $800,000 to me.  I'm confident I can make a good profit, but I'm also open to negotiation to make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $600,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to make more than that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $850,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's closer to my initial offer. I'm hoping Bob will see that it's a fair price and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $750,000 is a decent compromise and still a good profit for me. It's also more than John's offer, so it's the best outcome at this point."
