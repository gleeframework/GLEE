"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1150000. It's a valuable asset that's worth significantly more to you, and I believe this price reflects a fair deal for both of us. Let's discuss further.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  I'm willing to try and get a lower price.  I'll see if I can counteroffer and get closer to my target."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1050000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000, which is still a good deal considering the value to you.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference at $1,075,000?  This would allow us both to walk away with a favorable outcome.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1075000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1087500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's in both of our best interests to close this deal. Let's make it happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,087,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,087,500 is very close to my target price of $1,050,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price is too high.  Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a price that's still within my budget and is a good deal for me."
