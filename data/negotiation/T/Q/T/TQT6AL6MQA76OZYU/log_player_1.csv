Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a valuable asset that's worth significantly more to you, and I believe this price reflects a fair deal for both of us. Let's discuss further."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1050000.  I believe this price is fair considering the value to me and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I have 8 more rounds to try and negotiate a better price.  Selling to John right now would be a loss for me.  Rejecting and counter-offering gives me a chance to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a good deal considering the value to you.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference at $1075000?  This would allow us both to walk away with a favorable outcome.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still not a good deal for me. I'm not willing to settle for less than $1,000,000 at this point.  I'm going to counter-offer again and see if I can get him to budge."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,075,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,087,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's in both of our best interests to close this deal. Let's make it happen."", ""product_price"": 1087500}
