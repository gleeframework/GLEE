"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1050000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000, which is still a good deal considering the value to you.  Let's meet in the middle and finalize this.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1075000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1087500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's in both of our best interests to close this deal. Let's make it happen.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
