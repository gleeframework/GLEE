"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply not a viable price for me.  Considering the value and potential of this product, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This still allows for a healthy profit for you, while ensuring I receive a fair price.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's potential.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire for a good deal, and $750,000 is closer to what we're looking for. However, considering the value and potential of this product, I'm only able to go down to $850,000. This price reflects a fair compromise, and I believe it still represents a great opportunity for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,5,
