I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This gives me a potential profit of $300,000 over my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John and secure a profit of $1,200,000. This approach balances the potential for higher profit with the security of a guaranteed sale."
