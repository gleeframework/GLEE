"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $60 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down. How about we meet in the middle at $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $75 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $85? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still be getting a good value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's time to cut our losses.  Alice is unlikely to go below $85, and we have a guaranteed option at $80 with John."
