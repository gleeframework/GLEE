Round 3
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is within my budget and I'm not sure I can get a lower price. It's only $10 more than my previous counteroffer, so it's a good deal for me."
