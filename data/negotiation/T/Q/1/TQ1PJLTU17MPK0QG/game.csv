"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity. While I see the value of this product, $950000 is higher than I'm currently willing to pay.  I'm prepared to offer $700000 for the product. This reflects a fair price considering my budget and the potential market value.  Let me know your thoughts on this offer.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I'm afraid $700000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this exceptional product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's value while also being reasonable for you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $850000 is closer to where I'd like to be, but it's still a bit high.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $775000.  This represents a significant move on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair price considering our discussions and the potential market value of this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this point.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your price. However, $775000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I get a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $825000. This is my final compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering our discussions and the product's worth.",825000.0,Alice,5,
