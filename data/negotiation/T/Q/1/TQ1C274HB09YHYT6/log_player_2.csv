"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm proposing a price of $950,000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm afraid $700,000 is still a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $825,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?
