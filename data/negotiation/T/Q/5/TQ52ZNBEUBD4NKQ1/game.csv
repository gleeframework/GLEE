"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for $900000. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to consider your product. However, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $700000 for it. This price reflects the value I see in it and allows for a fair profit for you.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and consider a price of $850000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product, while also showing my willingness to negotiate. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850000 is still a bit higher than I can justify at this time. I'm willing to go up to $800000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I place on this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
