"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering my budget and the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit below that. How about we try $900,000? I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but that figure is too far removed from its actual value. I'm willing to come down slightly to $990,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",990000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $990,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, and I'm thinking $920,000 is a fair price. Can we consider this offer?",920000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitancy on your end. While I'm committed to finding a fair deal, I need to be realistic. I'm willing to consider $950,000, but this is absolutely my final offer. Let me know if this works for you.",950000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $915,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",915000.0,Bob,8,
