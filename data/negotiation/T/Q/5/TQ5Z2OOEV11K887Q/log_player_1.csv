**Reasoning:**

Bob has consistently been unwilling to meet even close to the minimum price.  At this stage, further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better offer. Accepting his current offer would mean a loss of $285,000 compared to John's guaranteed offer. It's time to cut losses and secure the guaranteed sale with John."
