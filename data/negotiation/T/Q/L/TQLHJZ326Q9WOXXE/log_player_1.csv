"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a truly unique opportunity with significant potential value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $600,000 is a significant amount of money, it's still below the minimum value I've set for the product ($800,000). I believe there's room for negotiation, and I want to explore whether Bob is genuinely interested in a higher price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a more favorable price and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $600,000 is a good starting point, I need to consider the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still reflects its unique potential. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $850000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $750000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still holding out for a better deal. Bob seems willing to negotiate, and I want to see if I can push him further. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a slightly higher price and potentially close the deal at a more favorable price for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $800,000. This is my final offer, considering the value of what I'm offering."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $790000. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $790,000 is very close to my minimum value of $800,000. However, considering we're only in Round 6, there's a risk of further negotiation reducing the price even lower.  

Selling to John at $800,000 guarantees me my minimum value and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob.  It's a safe and secure choice to achieve my goal."
