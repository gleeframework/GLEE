{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price point in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit to $110. This is still a good price for you, and it's closer to my minimum. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 110}

I'm still holding out for a better price.  $105 is closer to my goal, but I'm confident I can get a little more, especially since I have a backup offer from John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's split the difference this time - $107.50. It's a fair price for both of us, and it's getting us closer to a deal.  How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 107.5}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While I'm getting a little nervous about running out of time, I'm still holding out for a better price.  I'm not quite ready to accept $102.50 yet.  I believe I can get a little closer to my desired price in the next round."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've been negotiating with Bob for a while now, and it doesn't seem like we're going to be able to agree on a price that meets my minimum.  I've already reached a price with John that is much closer to my goal, so I'm going to take the sure thing and sell to John for $120."
