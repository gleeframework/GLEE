"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $110, which is less than the $120 John would charge.
* **You're getting a good deal:**  Even though the product is worth $120 to you, you're getting it for $110, which is a savings of $10."
