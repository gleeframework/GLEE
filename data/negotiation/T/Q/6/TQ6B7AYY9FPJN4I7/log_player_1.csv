Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly tone makes Bob feel more comfortable and open to negotiation.
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the value of the product can make Bob more inclined to accept. 
* **Prepared for Counteroffers:** I'm ready to negotiate further if Bob rejects my initial offer.  If things don't work out, I can always fall back on John's offer for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I'm only willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. Let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** It's below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Opportunity to Counter:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price.
* **John's Offer as Backup:** I have a guaranteed sale with John for $12,000, so I have the luxury of holding out for a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to accept $11,000 for the product. This gives us both a fair deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want to secure a decent profit.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains friendly and positive to keep the negotiation open.
* **Focus on Fairness:** Emphasizing a ""fair deal"" for both parties can help Bob feel more comfortable accepting.
* **Prepared for Further Negotiation:**  I'm still open to further discussion if Bob doesn't accept this offer. I have John as a backup, so I have the flexibility to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm still not able to meet at $11,000. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not enough:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. 
* **Chance for a higher counteroffer:** I believe I can likely get a better price by making another counteroffer.  
* **John's offer as a safety net:** I have a guaranteed sale with John, giving me the confidence to continue negotiating."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we compromise at $11,000?  That's halfway between our last two offers, and it would be a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stand my ground:** I'm sticking to my previous counteroffer of $11,000.  This shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price.
* **Compromise:**  I'm framing the offer as a compromise to make it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Focus on fairness:**  Reiterating the ""fair deal"" aspect can help build trust and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Prepared to walk away:**  I have John as a backup, so I'm not desperate and can afford to hold firm on my price."
