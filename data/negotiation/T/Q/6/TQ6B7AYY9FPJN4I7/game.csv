"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to accept $11,000 for the product. This gives us both a fair deal.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. I'm still not able to meet at $11,000. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we compromise at $11,000?  That's halfway between our last two offers, and it would be a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
