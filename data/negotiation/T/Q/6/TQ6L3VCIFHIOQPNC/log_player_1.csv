"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm going to start with my highest possible price. I know the product is worth at least $1,200,000 to me, so I'm not willing to settle for less. Bob may reject this offer, but I'm confident that I can negotiate with him if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below what the product is worth to me. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, so I'm not going to settle for such a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to lower my price to $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's still a price that I'm comfortable with. I believe that Bob might be willing to accept this offer, especially given that he's already shown interest in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While his offer has increased, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I believe that I can negotiate a higher price with Bob, and I'm not willing to settle for less than $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm going to offer $1,050,000.  This is getting close to Bob's estimated value, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping that Bob sees that I'm willing to negotiate and will meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is finally at my minimum acceptable price. It's better to secure this deal than to risk losing him and potentially ending up with a lower offer from John or having to negotiate further rounds with Bob."
