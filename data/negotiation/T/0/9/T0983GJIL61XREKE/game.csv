"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $11,000 is a little steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,200. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",10200.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9,600?",9600.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go as high as $9,600. I'm willing to give a bit more, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $10,500. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal.",10500.0,Alice,5,
