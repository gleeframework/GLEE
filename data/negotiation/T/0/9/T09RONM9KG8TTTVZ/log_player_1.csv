Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Optimistic:** I'm being optimistic that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay something closer to my desired price.
* **Safety Net:** I'm keeping John as a backup option, ensuring I can always get at least $15,000 if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $9,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob is already showing interest, and I might be able to get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps me in control and allows me to set the terms of the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Close to My Minimum:**  I'm coming down from my original offer, but still keeping the price above my minimum acceptable value.
* **Show Willingness to Compromise:** This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate, increasing the chance of reaching an agreement.
* **Keeping the Pressure On:** I'm not giving in completely, keeping the negotiation open and showing that I'm still in control."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is still significantly below my desired price of $15,000. 
* **No Significant Progress:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's not a substantial increase, and I don't believe there's much room for further negotiation. 
* **Risk of Lower Offers:** If I continue negotiating, Bob might lower his offer even further, putting me at a significant financial disadvantage. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John ensures I receive my minimum acceptable price, guaranteeing a profit and minimizing the risk of losing a better deal."
