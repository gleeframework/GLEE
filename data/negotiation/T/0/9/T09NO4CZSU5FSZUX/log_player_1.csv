Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me at $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $8,500 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price of $10,000. I'm going to try to negotiate further with Bob before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great deal for a product worth so much. Let's meet in the middle, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Can you meet me at $8,200? I'm really interested in the product, and I think it's worth it to me at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer, $8,200 is still too far below my minimum target of $10,000.  I'm confident I can get a better price.  We've got time and John is a good fallback option, but I want to see if I can close with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $8,750. It's a fair price for both of us, and I think it reflects the value of the product.  Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to the price I'm comfortable with, but I still think we can meet in the middle. Can you meet me at $8,500? I'm willing to pay that price for the product, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's tempting to close at $8,500, I'm still hopeful I can get closer to my desired price.  We've only got a few rounds left, but I think there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close. How about we meet in the middle at $8,625? It's a fair price for both of us, and it shows how committed I am to making this deal happen. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8625}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500, but I think I can do even better than that. Can you meet me at $8,300? I'm really interested in the product, and I think it's worth it to me at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds remaining, the offers are getting closer to my minimum target of $10,000. However, the negotiation is getting harder, and it's unlikely I'll be able to close with Bob at a price I'm satisfied with.  I'm going to cut my losses and sell to John, who will pay my minimum price."
