"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly unique, and I think you'll find it's well worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer.  $12,000 is above his budget, and he has a fallback option of buying from John for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price between $10000 and $12000. How about we meet in the middle at $11000? This is still a great deal for the product, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, he can still get the product for $10,000 from John. It's worth seeing if he can negotiate Alice down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $11,000 is closer, I'm still a bit above my budget.  I'm happy to meet you halfway, but I can only offer $10,500.  If you're open to that, I'm ready to move forward. "", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price between $10500 and $11000. How about we meet at $10750? This is still a great deal for the product, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  $10,750 is still above his self-imposed budget of $10,000, and he has a guaranteed way to acquire the product for his limit. While it's possible to continue negotiating with Alice, it's a risk - there's no guarantee she'll come down to his price, and the risk of her rejecting another counteroffer is too high."
