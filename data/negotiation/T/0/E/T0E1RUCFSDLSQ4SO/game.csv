"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,000,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $900,000 is still significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my desired price point. I'm offering $950,000.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering $937,500.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",937500.0,Alice,5,
