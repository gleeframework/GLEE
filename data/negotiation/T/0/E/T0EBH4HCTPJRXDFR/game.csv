"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something worth a million dollars to you for a slight premium. I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a better solution for both of us. I am willing to pay $950,000 for your product.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $950,000 is a little too low for me. The product is worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm sure you can see the value in that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This would be a good compromise for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I still feel that $1,025,000 is a bit steep. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose $1,000,000 as a fair price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
