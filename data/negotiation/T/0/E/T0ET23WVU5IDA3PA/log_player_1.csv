Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This leaves a significant profit margin for me while still being attractive to Bob, as it's below his perceived value of $1,200,000.  I want to see if he's willing to negotiate from this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but it's still lower than the initial offer I made. I'm going to counteroffer again to try and push for a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000.  This is a slight increase from Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $920,000 is a good compromise. It's a substantial profit for me, exceeding my minimum goal of $800,000, and it seems unlikely that further negotiation will yield a significantly better price.  Accepting this offer ensures a solid deal."
