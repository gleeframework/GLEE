**Reasoning:**

Alice is consistently meeting you halfway. At this point, the difference between your offer and hers is getting smaller ($200). It's unlikely she'll drop much further, and continuing to negotiate might irritate her.  $8,100 is a reasonable price, saving you almost $4,000 from John's offer."
