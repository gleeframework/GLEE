Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, but still potentially appealing to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's my minimum value. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135} 
```

I'm making a counteroffer that's halfway between my minimum and my initial offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is only $5 less than my initial offer and above my minimum. It's not ideal, but it's worth accepting to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially ending up with John's offer of $120."
