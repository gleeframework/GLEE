"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $15,000 is far above your budget of $10,000. It's better to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer, about half of Alice's initial price. This will gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and hopefully set the stage for a more balanced negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still above my budget, but closer. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm raising my offer slightly to $9,000. This demonstrates that I'm serious about buying the product, but still pushing for a price closer to my limit.  It also leaves some room for compromise in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While $11,000 is getting closer to my limit, I'm still only 10% away from my ideal price with John. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my target without jeopardizing my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer again, but only by a small margin. I believe this shows Alice that I'm serious about making a deal and that I'm willing to compromise.  I'm hoping that Alice will see that this is a fair price, considering her previous offers and my willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm still willing to negotiate. Although Alice's offer is only $500 above my ideal price, I'm not willing to pay that much extra just to avoid the risk of further rounds. I believe I can still convince Alice to come down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm finally reaching my maximum budget limit. I'm confident Alice is realizing she's unlikely to get a higher price. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping she accepts. If she doesn't, I'll move to John as a backup."
