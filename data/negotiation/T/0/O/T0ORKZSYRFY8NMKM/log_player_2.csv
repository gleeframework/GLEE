Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit lower than my target price. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Even though Alice has come down in price, it's still beneficial to see if you can get closer to your target. You have room to negotiate before hitting John's $12,000 price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your continued flexibility.  $13,500 is getting close, but to make this work for me, I'd need to be at $11,500.  Do you think that's something we could agree on?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and my costs. I think it's a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $12,500.  It's better to secure the product from John at your target price of $12,000 rather than risk Alice sticking to her price or the negotiation stalling."
