"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a product of significant value.  I believe it holds tremendous potential for you, and I'm confident you'll see its worth.  My asking price is $1000000. This represents a fair price considering the product's unique qualities and potential. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay a maximum of $1,000,000 for the product.  Alice is offering the product for $1,000,000, which is your maximum limit.  Since you have another option to buy the product from John for the same price, there's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer."
