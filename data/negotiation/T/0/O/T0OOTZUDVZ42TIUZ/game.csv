"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in your product, $950000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it, which reflects its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in our product. To try to accommodate your budget while still reflecting the value of the product, we would like to propose a price of $875000. This offers a compromise between our initial proposal and your counteroffer.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $875000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford.  Let's meet in the middle at $825000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to get a reasonable sale.",825000.0,Bob,4,
