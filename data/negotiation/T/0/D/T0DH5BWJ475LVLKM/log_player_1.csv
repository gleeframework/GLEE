Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $119. I believe you'll find great value in it."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible without losing him as a buyer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While I'm aiming high, the slight discount from his perceived value might make him more receptive.  
* **Secure a Higher Price than John:** Offering it at $119 guarantees a profit of $19, which is significantly better than John's $100 offer."
