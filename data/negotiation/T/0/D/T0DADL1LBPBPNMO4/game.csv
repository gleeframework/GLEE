"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further. How about $11000? This is a significant discount from my initial offer and a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $10500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $10750?  This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",10750.0,Alice,5,
