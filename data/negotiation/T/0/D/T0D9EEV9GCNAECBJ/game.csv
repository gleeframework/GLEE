"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to my business, but I need to stay within a reasonable budget. How about we start closer to my range? Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a good deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,000.  That's a significant jump from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $7,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a good deal. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",8500.0,Alice,5,
