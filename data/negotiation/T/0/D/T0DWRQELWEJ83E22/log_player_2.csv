"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, and I believe it's also a great value for the price. I'd like to offer it to you for $100. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's starting price is higher than what you know you can get it for from John ($120).  There's room to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're starting the negotiation significantly lower than Alice's opening offer but still giving some room to negotiate upwards. This approach aims to establish a lower price range early on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. To better accommodate your budget, I am now offering the product for $90. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, which is a good sign. However, we're still above our ideal price and have room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $87?  That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 87
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're nudging the price closer to our goal while still showing willingness to compromise.  By suggesting a middle ground, we encourage Alice to continue negotiating."
