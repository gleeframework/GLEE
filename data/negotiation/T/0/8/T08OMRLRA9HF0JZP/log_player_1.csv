Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This leaves room for negotiation, as the product is worth $15,000 to him, but still gives me a profit greater than my minimum of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is still above my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident that further negotiation will not yield a significantly higher offer. Therefore, accepting his offer is the most rational choice."
