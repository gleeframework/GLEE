"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1050000.  It's a valuable asset that I know will be worth every penny to you. I'm open to negotiation, but I'm confident this price reflects its true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950000 is a good starting point, I need to stay closer to my asking price to make this worthwhile for me. I'm willing to come down to $1000000, which still represents a fair value for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.

Alice has come down to a price that is equal to what John is offering.  At this point, there's no benefit to continuing to negotiate.  Accepting Alice's offer saves time and ensures the deal is finalized."
