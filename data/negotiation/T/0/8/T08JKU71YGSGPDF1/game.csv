"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1050000.  It's a valuable asset that I know will be worth every penny to you. I'm open to negotiation, but I'm confident this price reflects its true worth.",1050000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of your product, $1050000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $950000 for it. Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950000 is a good starting point, I need to stay closer to my asking price to make this worthwhile for me. I'm willing to come down to $1000000, which still represents a fair value for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
