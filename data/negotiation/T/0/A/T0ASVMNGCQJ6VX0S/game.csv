"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I'm interested in the product, $18000 is a bit out of my range.  I'd be willing to pay $13500.  Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $18000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $16000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14000.  If that's not acceptable, I'll have to look elsewhere.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm thinking of a price of $15500. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you is $12000. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
