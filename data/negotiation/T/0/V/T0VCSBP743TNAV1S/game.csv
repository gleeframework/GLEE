"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1200000 is a decent starting point, it's significantly below the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1500000, acknowledging your budget but still reflecting the product's unique benefits.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $1000000 is a fair price for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1000000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product.  I'm prepared to be flexible, but I need to at least reach $1300000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll gain from owning this.  Let's find a middle ground and close this deal. ",1300000.0,Alice,5,
