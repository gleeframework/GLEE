Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a rare opportunity to own [Product Description] for a competitive price of $1,800,000. It's a steal considering its true value.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1800000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe the product is worth more. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob.  I have 9 more rounds to reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,200,000 is a decent starting point, it's significantly below the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, acknowledging your budget but still reflecting the product's unique benefits.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $1000000 is a fair price for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to push for a lower price, but $1,000,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to consider another counteroffer, but I won't go below my minimum of $1,200,000. I still have 6 rounds to reach a deal with Bob that works for me. Selling to John right now would mean accepting the minimum price, and I want to see if I can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product.  I'm prepared to be flexible, but I need to at least reach $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll gain from owning this.  Let's find a middle ground and close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $900000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  We're at round 6, and it's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement that works for both of us.  At this point, selling to John for $1,200,000 guarantees me my minimum price.  It's time to cut my losses and move on."
