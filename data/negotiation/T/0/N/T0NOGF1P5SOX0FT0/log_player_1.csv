Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value, but I'm willing to negotiate slightly if you're serious. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you want to start higher with Bob to see if you can maximize your profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message implies flexibility, which might encourage Bob to counter-offer instead of outright rejecting the initial price. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's value, you're providing a reason for the high price, even if Bob values it less.

**Important:** This is just one strategy. Depending on Bob's personality (if you had more information about him), you might choose a different approach."
