Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're trying to meet in the middle, but $750,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $850,000.  It's a fair price, considering the value of this product, and allows us to both walk away with a good deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $850,000 and I can get the product for $800,000 from John. It's not worth the risk of continuing negotiations with Alice."
