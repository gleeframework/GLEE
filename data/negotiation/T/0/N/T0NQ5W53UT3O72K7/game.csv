"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us - a fair price for you and a significant profit for me. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still leaves room for both of us to make a profit.  Let's find a middle ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit far off from that number. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to meet in the middle, but $750,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $850,000.  It's a fair price, considering the value of this product, and allows us to both walk away with a good deal. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
