Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  I understand your perspective, however, the value of this product is truly significant and $600,000 undervalues it considerably.  I could consider a price of $925,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value you'll gain.
