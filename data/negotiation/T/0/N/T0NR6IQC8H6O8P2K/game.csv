"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  I understand your perspective, however, the value of this product is truly significant and $600,000 undervalues it considerably.  I could consider a price of $925,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value you'll gain.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the reply.  I appreciate you coming down, but $925,000 is still a bit beyond what I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle somewhere, say around $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
