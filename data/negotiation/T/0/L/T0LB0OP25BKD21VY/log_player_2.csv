"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1100000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's always advantageous to negotiate, especially since you have a guaranteed alternative (buying from John).  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to spend no more than $1,000,000 on this product. Would you be willing to consider that price? I'm very interested in purchasing, but that's my maximum budget."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
