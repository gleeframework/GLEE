# Alice's message: Bob, I'm confident this product is worth at least $1 million to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a significant discount from what you'd be able to get elsewhere, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within a budget, and I'm willing to compromise a little. $850000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to go, but I'm open to meeting you at $900000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.
