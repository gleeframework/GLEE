"Bob, I'm confident this product is worth at least $1 million to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a significant discount from what you'd be able to get elsewhere, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I really like the product, but I'm trying to stay within a budget. Can you meet me at that price?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within a budget, and I'm willing to compromise a little. $850000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to go, but I'm open to meeting you at $900000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $880000. Can you meet me at that price?",880000.0,Bob,4,
