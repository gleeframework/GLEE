"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. I'm willing to start with a price of $1400000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product at such a high value. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1400000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1300000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $1350000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price, Alice. It shows your flexibility and understanding of my budgetary constraints. While I understand that $1350000 is the lowest you can go, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1325000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see that you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1325000 and $1350000, so I'll propose a counteroffer of $1337500. This is the best I can do, and I hope it's acceptable to you.",1337500.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your effort to find a mutually agreeable price. Based on your latest proposal of $1337500, I would like to counter with an offer of $1330000. I believe this price reflects a reasonable compromise while still respecting your bottom line.",1330000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close to reaching an agreement, Bob. However, I'm still a bit above your latest offer. I'm willing to make one final adjustment to $1335000. This is my absolute best price, and I hope it's acceptable to you.",1335000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your final offer, Alice. It's a step in the right direction. Based on your latest proposal of $1335000, I would like to counter with an offer of $1332500. I believe this price strikes a balance between respecting your position and staying within my budget.",1332500.0,Bob,8,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1335000. I'm willing to make one more slight adjustment, and I'll meet you at $1333750. This is the absolute limit of my flexibility, and I hope you can accept it.",1333750.0,Alice,9,

"Thank you for your final offer, Alice. I've considered your latest proposal carefully, and I would like to counter with an offer of $1332000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between our respective positions.",1332000.0,Bob,10,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $1333750, Bob. I've already stretched my limit, and I'm starting to think that selling to you might not be the best option. I'm willing to walk away and sell the product to John for $1200000 if we can't come to an agreement. I'll give you one last chance to meet me at $1333750, but if not, I'll be forced to consider other options.",1333750.0,Alice,11,
