Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not quite comfortable with $110, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $125? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125

Alice is very unlikely to go below $125, and it's not worth the risk of further negotiation.  Buying from John for $120 guarantees the best price."
