"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $140.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  The product is worth $120 to her, so there's room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be open to $130? Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  How about $135? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135

Alice's counteroffer of $135 is a good compromise.  It's within my budget and still a good deal for both of us."
