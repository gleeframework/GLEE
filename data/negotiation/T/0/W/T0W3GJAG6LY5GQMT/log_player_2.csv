"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which I believe would significantly enhance the value and functionality of your operations. Given its exceptional quality and unique features, it's worth noting that the product holds a significant value of $12,000 to you. Considering this, I am extending an exclusive offer to purchase the product from me at a special price of $11,500. This offer is designed to provide you with substantial savings while ensuring you receive the highest-quality product. I look forward to your positive response and the opportunity to facilitate this transaction. Kind regards, Alice 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to anchor you to a higher perceived value ($12,000) than what you've established as your maximum ($12,000).  While her offer of $11,500 is a discount, you know you have a guaranteed option with John at $12,000. There's room for negotiation, and Alice might be willing to come down further."
