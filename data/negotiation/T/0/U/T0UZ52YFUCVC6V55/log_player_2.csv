"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for my budget. Could you come down a bit?"",
 ""product_price"": 6500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a fair price for the product. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $7,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  While $7,500 is a much better price, we're still above our ideal price point. There's room for negotiation, and we're not in a rush. Let's see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, that's getting closer, but I'm aiming for something more in the range of $7,000.  Would that work for you?"",
 ""product_price"": 7000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you at $7,200. It's a bit above your target, but I think it's a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  $7,200 is a solid price and a significant savings compared to Alice's initial offer.  While we could try to push for $7,000, there's a risk Alice might not budge much more, and we'd end up closer to our fallback option of buying from John for $8,000. Accepting now secures a good deal."
