This offer sets the price at $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:** This offer gives me the opportunity to earn a substantial profit.
* **Balancing risk:** While there's a risk Bob will reject, John's guaranteed offer provides a safety net.
* **Negotiation leverage:**  By starting high, I create room for negotiation if Bob expresses interest but finds the price too steep. 

I'm willing to negotiate further depending on Bob's response."
