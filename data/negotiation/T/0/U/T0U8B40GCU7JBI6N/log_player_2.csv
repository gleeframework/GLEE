Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're almost there!  I understand your budget constraints, but $7,900 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $8,400.

It's time to cut your losses. Alice is very unlikely to go below $8,000, and you have a guaranteed option at that price with John.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice and potentially missing out on John's offer."
