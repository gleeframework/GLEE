"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $85?  It's still a good price for you, and it's a great deal for me!",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, $85 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a great price for you considering the value you'll get from this product.  Let's see if we can make this work!",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $90 is still a bit higher than what I'm willing to pay.  How about we split the difference and settle on $87.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal.",87.5,Bob,4,
