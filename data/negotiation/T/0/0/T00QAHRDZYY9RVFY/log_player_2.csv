You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth $100 to you, and Alice is asking for $95.  It's worth trying to get a better price.  You can likely get a better deal with a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, $85 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a great price for you considering the value you'll get from this product.  Let's see if we can make this work! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

While $90 is better than $95, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I'm going to try to get Alice down to $85, which is a fair price for both of us."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $90 is still a bit higher than what I'm willing to pay.  How about we split the difference and settle on $87.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
