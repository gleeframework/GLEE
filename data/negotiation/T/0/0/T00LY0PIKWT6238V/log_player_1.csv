"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in your product, but $14000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  How about $13000?  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's still well above what the product is worth to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer, as I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500 to show you I'm serious about making a deal. This still offers you a great value, and allows me to get closer to my desired price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $13250?  This would be a good compromise, and I'm sure you'd still make a decent profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer, I'm still confident I can secure a better price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $13,250 is still below what I need. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13,375. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both agree on. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13375}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13375 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really close to my budget limit, and I'm not sure I can go any higher. How about $13125?  This is a fair price that allows us both to get what we need from this deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's getting very close and I'm concerned that if I reject it, he might walk away or continue to haggle down to a point where I'm better off selling to John.  I'm also running out of rounds."
