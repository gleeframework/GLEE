"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe is worth a significant amount to you.  I'm asking for $1,100,000 for it. This is a price that reflects the value of the product while still leaving room for you to profit.  If you're interested, let's discuss further.  If not, I have another buyer lined up.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
