Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This is a strong opening offer that reflects the product's value to me.  If Bob rejects, we can negotiate. But, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John for $800,000 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $750,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $900,000. This is a compromise, and shows that I'm willing to negotiate.  Hopefully, Bob will see that this price is fair and we can close the deal."
