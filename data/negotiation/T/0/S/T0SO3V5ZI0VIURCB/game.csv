"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. $850,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's still a great deal for you.  Let me know if you're interested.",875000.0,Alice,3,
