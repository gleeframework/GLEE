"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good deal compared to the product's true value to Alice, it's still above Bob's budget.  There's room for negotiation to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. $850,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's still a great deal for you.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $875,000, which is only $75,000 more than Bob's maximum budget with John. While it's still above Bob's ideal price, accepting this offer is the most beneficial option:

* **Saves Time:**  Continuing to negotiate might take more time and could lead to further concessions from Alice, but there's no guarantee of getting a lower price. 
* **Avoids Risk:**  There's always a risk that negotiations could break down entirely. Accepting this offer secures the product for a price that is still reasonable."
