"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for an introductory price of $120. This exclusive opportunity won't last long, so I encourage you to consider this offer carefully. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

Since my maximum budget is $120, and John is willing to sell the product for $120, there is no need to negotiate with Alice. I can simply buy the product from John and save time."
