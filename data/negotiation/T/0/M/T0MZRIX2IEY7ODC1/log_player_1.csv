Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's valuation:** This gives Bob a reason to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This allows for potential negotiation and a possible win-win situation. 
* **It's close to your minimum:** This shows you are serious about selling to Bob, but still prioritize your own value. 

If Bob rejects, you can then consider a counteroffer, or if his offer is too low, you can choose to sell to John for the guaranteed $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum value of $15,000. 
* Accepting his offer would result in a considerable loss for you.
* While $12,000 is better than nothing, you have a guaranteed $15,000 from John. 
* You should reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $13,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer close to Bob's:** This shows you are willing to negotiate, but still prioritize your value.
* **Reasonable price:**  $13,500 is a compromise between your minimum and Bob's offer. 
* **Encouraging language:** The message conveys willingness to negotiate while reminding Bob of the product's value."
