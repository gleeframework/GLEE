"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This would be a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm trying to stick to a tighter budget. Could we do $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $7,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $8,000, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested.",8000.0,Alice,5,
