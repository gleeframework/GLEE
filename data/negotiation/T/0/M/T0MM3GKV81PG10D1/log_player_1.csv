Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth it to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it is:

* **Higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him an incentive to negotiate.
* **Lower than your minimum value:** You still get a good profit.

By starting high, I can potentially negotiate down to a price closer to my desired value. However, if he rejects, I'm ready to counter-offer, or go with John's offer of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low. It's less than half of my minimum value and less than what I offered him.  I'm going to counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value and see if we can come to a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm trying to stick to a tighter budget. Could we do $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell it for that price. I'm going to counter-offer again to try and get closer to my desired value. If he rejects, I will go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $7,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $8,000, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 8000}
