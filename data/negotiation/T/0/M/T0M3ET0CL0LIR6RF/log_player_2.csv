"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth more to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,500 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $13,500.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $14,000?  That's still a good deal for both of us. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get the product for as close to $13,500 as possible.  While Alice has lowered her price, it's still not at a point where Bob is ready to accept.  He'll continue to try and negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.
