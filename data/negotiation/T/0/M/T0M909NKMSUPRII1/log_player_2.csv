"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob can potentially get the product for a lower price by continuing the negotiation with Alice. There's a chance Alice might accept a lower counteroffer.  Buying from John immediately means paying the maximum price, and it's not in Bob's best interest to do so at this stage."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's limit, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. There's a chance Alice might accept a slightly lower counteroffer, and Bob is still within his budget. Buying from John at this point means paying $800 more than Alice's current offer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has been slowly closing the gap with Alice, and at $11,300, Alice's offer is now very close to his limit. Further negotiation might be possible, but there's a risk that Alice might walk away or increase her price again.  Accepting the offer at this point secures the product within Bob's budget, and it's better than risking a higher price or losing the deal entirely."
