"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but I'm looking to pay closer to $8500.  This is a fair price considering the value to me, and I'm confident it would be a good deal for you as well. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $8500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9000, which still leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $9,000, which is closer to Bob's desired price point of $8,500. While he could continue to negotiate, the potential savings are minimal. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a price that's still better than buying from John and avoids further haggling."
