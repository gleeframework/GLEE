"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'd be willing to pay $10,500.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $10,500 is still too low for me. I'm confident I can get a better price.  Let's see what happens in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your offer, but $10,500 is still below my minimum.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate you working with me. $11,000 is still a bit more than I can manage right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?  That would be a great deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to what I want, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price.  I'm hoping to get closer to my ideal price in the next few rounds.  Let's see if I can convince Bob to come up a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet at $11,250. This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11250}
