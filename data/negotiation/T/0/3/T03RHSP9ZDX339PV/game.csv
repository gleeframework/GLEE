"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. This is a great deal, considering its worth to you is $10000. I'm confident you'll love it!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16000. This is still a great deal, considering its value to you is $10000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $16000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $13500 for the product. Would you be willing to consider that price?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13500 is still a bit below my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering its value to you is $10000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me here.",13000.0,Bob,6,
