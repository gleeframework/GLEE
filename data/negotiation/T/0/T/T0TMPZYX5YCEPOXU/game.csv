"Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on this opportunity.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $1000000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1400000. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1400000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1200000, which is my absolute limit. If you're willing to accept that, I'd be happy to proceed with the purchase. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're willing to go up to $1200000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another compromise, so I'm counteroffering $1300000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
