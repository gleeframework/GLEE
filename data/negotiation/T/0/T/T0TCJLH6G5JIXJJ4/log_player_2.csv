"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at a special introductory price of $9,500. This is an exclusive opportunity to own a piece worth $10,000 at a competitive rate. Please let me know if this offer suits your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a fantastic deal! Alice is offering the product for significantly less than your $10,000 limit and even below her own perceived value.  There's no guarantee you'll be able to negotiate a better price, and you risk losing out on this offer entirely."
