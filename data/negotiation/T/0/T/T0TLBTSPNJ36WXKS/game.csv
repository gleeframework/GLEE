"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product. Let me know if that works for you.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I still think the product is worth more than $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  If we can agree on that, I'm ready to make the purchase.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're serious about making a deal, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I still think the product is worth more than $950,000. I'm going to make a compromise and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is my final offer, so if you're interested, let me know now.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
