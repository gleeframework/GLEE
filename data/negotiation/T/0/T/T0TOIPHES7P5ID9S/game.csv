"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $120 is too low for me. This product is high-quality and worth a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $170?",170.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product is high-quality, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $170. I'm willing to meet you at $145, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",145.0,Bob,4,
