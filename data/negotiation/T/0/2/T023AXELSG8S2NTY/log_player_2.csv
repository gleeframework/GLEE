Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great price, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a fair starting point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save a bit more, but I'm still confident in the product's value.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $850,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $875,000 is within your budget and only $75,000 more than your ideal price of $800,000.
* Accepting the offer saves you $125,000 compared to buying from John. 
* Continuing to negotiate might get you a slightly lower price, but it's not worth the risk of losing the deal or running out of time."
