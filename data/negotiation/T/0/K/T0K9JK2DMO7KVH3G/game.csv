"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value to me, I'm willing to pay $850000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850000 is still a bit low for me, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $950000. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and is a fair compromise.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $950000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900000.  This is a fair price considering my needs and your desired selling point.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $900000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, taking into account the value you've placed on the product. I'm offering the product to you for $1050000. This is a fair price considering the value I've placed on it, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
