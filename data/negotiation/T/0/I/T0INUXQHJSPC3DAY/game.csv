"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $90 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  Let's split the difference. How about $100? It's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Alice,3,
