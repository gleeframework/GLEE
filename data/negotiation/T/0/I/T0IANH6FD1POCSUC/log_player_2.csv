"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is a good price, it's still higher than Alice's perceived value. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, demonstrating Bob's intent to negotiate hard.  
* **Within Budget:**  It's still within Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **Room for Compromise:** It leaves room for Alice to counter without going below her minimum value of $1,000,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm not quite ready to come down to $1,200,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,300,000? This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Compromise:** Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is a good compromise, as it's halfway between Bob's counteroffer and her initial offer.
* **Saving Money:**  It's still a significant saving compared to John's offer of $1,500,000.
* **Avoiding Further Negotiation:**  While there might be a chance to get a slightly lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers or going back and forth for several more rounds outweighs the potential savings. Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids the uncertainty of prolonged negotiations."
