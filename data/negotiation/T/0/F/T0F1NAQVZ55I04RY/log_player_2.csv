Round 7

Alice's counteroffer is a step back, moving further away from your desired price.  You still have a few rounds left and haven't reached your maximum budget.  Rejecting this offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price.  It's possible Alice may be willing to compromise further in the remaining rounds to avoid losing the deal entirely.  However, if her next offer is unfavorable, you'll be closer to considering buying from John."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price, but $1,200,000 is still beyond what I can afford. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000 as my final compromise.

Let's not let this opportunity slip away."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to get concerned that we're getting too close to the end of our negotiation. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1250000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle for once. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above your desired price and is getting closer to John's price. You have only one round left, and with only one round left, it's unlikely that you can get a better deal from Alice. It's more beneficial to buy the product from John for $1,500,000. Although it's not your ideal price, it's still within your budget, and it avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
