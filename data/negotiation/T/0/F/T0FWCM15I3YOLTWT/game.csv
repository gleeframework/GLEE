"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1500000 is higher than I'm willing to go at this time.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $1000000.  Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1000000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $1300000? It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. ",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1300000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a bit higher than my comfortable range.  I'm prepared to go to $1150000.  This is a serious offer, and I'm confident this product has potential, but I need to stay within my budget.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your serious offer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $1150000 is still a bit below where I need to be. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1250000? This represents a significant opportunity for you, and I believe you'll see a strong return on your investment. ",1250000.0,Alice,5,
