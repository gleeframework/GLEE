"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $950000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be happy to pay $700000 for this product, but I'm not sure I can go higher.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit over my budget at $850000. I'm willing to go up to $825000, but that's my absolute final offer.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $825000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $875000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value.
