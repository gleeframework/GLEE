Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum acceptable price:** I know I can get $1,000,000 from John, so that's my baseline.
* **Potential upside:**  I'm aiming to earn more than $1,000,000.  By setting a price of $1,500,000, I'm leaving room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay more. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a risk Bob will reject this offer. However, the potential reward of a higher price makes this risk worth taking.

**Important Notes:**

* This is a starting point.  I may need to adjust my offer based on Bob's reaction or other factors.
* If Bob rejects, I will sell to John for $1,000,000 to ensure I don't lose out on the opportunity."
