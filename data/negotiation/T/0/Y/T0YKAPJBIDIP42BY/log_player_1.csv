**Reasoning:**

While I'd ideally like to get more, Bob is firmly rooted at $8,700 and has called this his final offer.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better result, and there's a risk Bob will walk away altogether. Accepting his offer secures a profit above my minimum and avoids potentially missing out on a sale entirely."
