"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I believe $1,400,000 is a bit steep. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This price allows both of us to benefit from this transaction.  Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm aiming for a higher number, I'm willing to move closer to your proposal. How about we settle at $1,325,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value to both of us.",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,325,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $1,300,000, which is a fair middle ground.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
