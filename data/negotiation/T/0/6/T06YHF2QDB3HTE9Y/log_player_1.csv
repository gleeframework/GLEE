{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000.  It's a unique and valuable item, and I believe it could be a great asset for you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's a bit higher than my minimum value ($10,000) but leaves room for negotiation.  By explaining the value of the product, I'm hoping to pique Bob's interest and encourage him to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $12000 for it. Could we possibly come to an agreement at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $13,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to still make a good profit on the sale."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad you're willing to negotiate, Alice. I'll consider $13500 as a starting point. Can we aim for $13000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer of $13,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to my desired price and is significantly better than selling to John for $10,000.  I'll accept his offer."
