"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $850000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $600000.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to pay closer to $600000, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with $725000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",725000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $725000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $675000?  I believe this would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",675000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $675000, but I'm not quite ready to give up on getting a higher price. I'll counter with $700000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product.",700000.0,Alice,5,
