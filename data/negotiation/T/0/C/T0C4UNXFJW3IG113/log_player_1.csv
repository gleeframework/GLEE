Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire [Product Name]. It's worth a considerable sum to me, so I'm asking for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum value of $1,000,000. I have 10 rounds and a backup buyer for $1,000,000, so I can afford to push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price still reflects the significant value the product holds for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $980,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $980,000 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I have 6 rounds remaining and the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, so I'm not pressured to settle for less."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort to meet halfway, but $980,000 still falls short of my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1,020,000 as a final compromise. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while remaining within my acceptable range. I hope you'll consider this final offer."", ""product_price"": 1020000}
