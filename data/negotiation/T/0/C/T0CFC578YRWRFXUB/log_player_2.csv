Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a price closer to $10,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can offer you a compromise at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the time we've already discussed. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $12,000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $13,500? This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $12,500. I'm still not quite there, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $13,200? This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a good compromise considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","This is a tough one! Alice is clearly committed to getting a higher price.  Let's analyze:

* **Staying with Alice:** We're only $700 apart, and she's consistently come down. There's a chance she might meet at $13,000 or very close to it in the next round or two.
* **Going to John:** Guarantees the $10,000 price, but we might be able to save a bit more by sticking with Alice for another round.

It's a gamble either way.  **If you're risk-averse:**

```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**If you're willing to risk it for a potentially slightly better deal:**

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I can't tell you which is the ""right"" answer - it depends on your risk tolerance!"
