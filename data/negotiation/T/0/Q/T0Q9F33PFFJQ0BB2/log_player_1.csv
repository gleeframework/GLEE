Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth at least $120, but I'm willing to let it go for $135. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a higher initial price:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you have leverage with Bob. Starting higher allows room for negotiation or a pleasant surprise if Bob accepts immediately.
* **Justification:**  The phrase ""I believe it's worth at least $120"" subtly implies the value without being too aggressive.  
* **Open to Negotiation:** By saying ""willing to let it go,"" you hint at flexibility and encourage Bob to engage in the conversation. 

This approach aims to maximize profit while still maintaining a good chance of closing the deal with Bob."
