"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This represents a fair compromise given its value to both of us.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However,  $1,100,000 is considerably below my initial assessment of the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,450,000?",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,450,000 is still a stretch for me. Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm prepared to pay $1,200,000. This would allow us to both close this deal fairly.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm prepared to move a bit closer to your price, but $1,200,000 is still too low. How about we settle on $1,325,000? This represents a significant compromise on my end.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
