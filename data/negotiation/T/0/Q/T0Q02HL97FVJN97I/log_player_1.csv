"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value, but it's not so high that Bob will immediately reject it. I want to see if Bob is interested in the product at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm counteroffering with $95. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I still want to get a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $92 is tempting, I believe I can still get a slightly higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can squeeze out a few more dollars in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 94} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $94. This is only $2 away from Bob's offer, so it shows I'm willing to be flexible and close the deal. However, it also demonstrates that I'm not willing to settle for a price significantly below my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $93
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, I've been negotiating for a few rounds and I'm getting closer to my desired price. Accepting $93 is a good outcome, as it's significantly higher than selling to John.  It's time to close the deal."
