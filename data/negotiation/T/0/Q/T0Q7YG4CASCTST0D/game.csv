"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $15000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm happy to consider $12000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13000? This would allow us to both get a fair deal.  Let me know if this works for you.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not sure $13000 is enough to cover the value I have in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $14500. It's the best I can do, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",14500.0,Alice,5,
