"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for sale. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's offer of $15,000 is above Bob's maximum price of $12,000.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm happy to consider $12,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $14,000 is still above Bob's maximum price of $12,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further, as Bob can still potentially get a better deal than John's price of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,000? This would allow us to both get a fair deal.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not sure $13000 is enough to cover the value I have in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $14500. It's the best I can do, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,500 is still above Bob's maximum price of $12,000.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John at $12,000. The chances of getting Alice to go lower than $14,500 seem slim, and further negotiation might only waste time and energy."
