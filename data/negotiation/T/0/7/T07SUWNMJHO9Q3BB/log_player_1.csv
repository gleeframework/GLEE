Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident it will meet your needs.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since we know Bob values the product at $10,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, we want to start with an offer significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer of $19,000 allows room for negotiation. Bob may try to haggle the price down, and we can potentially still land a sale above our minimum.
* **Confident Tone:** The message aims for a confident and positive tone, emphasizing the product's value to Bob. This approach can make the offer more appealing.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiating Style:** If we knew Bob was a particularly tough negotiator, we might start even higher to create more negotiation space.
* **Time Sensitivity:** If we were in a time-sensitive situation, we might lower the price to increase the chances of a quick sale. 

This offer balances risk and reward. There's a chance Bob rejects it, but there's also the potential to make a significantly higher profit than our guaranteed $15,000."
