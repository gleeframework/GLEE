"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $120, but Alice is asking for $110. 
* **Negotiation is possible.** There's room to negotiate a lower price, and you have 10 rounds to do so.
* **Buying from John is a backup.**  You have the option of buying from John if the negotiation fails, but it's better to try to get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $110 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $95 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant drop:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing your seriousness in negotiating.
* **Reasonable price:**  $95 is still within your budget and leaves some room for Alice to make a counteroffer without losing too much.
* **Open communication:**  The message is friendly and shows a willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I understand you're looking for a good deal,  How about we meet in the middle at $102? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good compromise:** $102 is a good compromise, falling within your budget and getting closer to your desired price.
* **Limited rounds:** While further negotiation is possible, you've already used two rounds, leaving you with less time to reach an even lower price.
* **Risk of escalation:**  Rejecting Alice's offer might lead to more rounds of back-and-forth, potentially increasing the price again. 
* **Buying from John:** While buying from John is an option, you're closer to a deal with Alice, and the price difference is only $18."
