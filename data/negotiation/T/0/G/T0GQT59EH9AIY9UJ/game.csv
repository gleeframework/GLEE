"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity for you to acquire something that's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to start with a price of $10,000.",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $9,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle on $9,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm not quite there yet. I can offer you a price of $9,750, which is still a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",9750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that. To be completely transparent, I've found a similar product elsewhere for $9,250. If you're able to match that price, I'm ready to close the deal right now. ",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to match the price you found elsewhere, but I can offer you a price of $9,500, which is still a good deal considering the value the product brings to you. I'm not budging from this price, so if you're interested, let's finalize the deal.",9500.0,Alice,7,
