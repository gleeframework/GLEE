"Thanks Alice, this product sounds great.  However, $850000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $750000 for it. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that 850000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do 820000, which is a significant discount from my original price. What do you think?",820000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $820000 is still a bit high for me. I'm comfortable paying $780000. Let's see if we can reach a deal there.",780000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do 795000, which is a compromise between my original price and your offer. What do you think?",795000.0,Alice,5,
