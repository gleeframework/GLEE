"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. I believe that's a fair price considering the potential benefits it could bring to my business.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand that $1500000 is a significant amount, but I'm afraid I need to consider my costs and the value I've placed on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $1750000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and potential benefits to your business.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1750000. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1600000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the potential benefits it could bring to my business.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1600000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm fairly compensated for the product's value. I'm thinking of $1725000. This is a bit higher than your last offer, but I believe it's a reasonable compromise given the product's potential benefits to your business.",1725000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think that we're getting a bit too far apart, Alice. I'd like to make one final offer. I'm willing to pay $1650000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential benefits it could bring to my business. I'm not willing to go any higher than this, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1650000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm afraid I need to prioritize my own goals. I'm willing to meet you at $1675000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential benefits it could bring to your business. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1675000.0,Alice,7,
