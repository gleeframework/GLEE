"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1500000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm prepared to offer $1100000.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've described.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $1100000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1300000. This is a fair price considering the value I've described, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this unique item.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1300000 is still above my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1200000, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the value we've discussed.  If this isn't acceptable, I may need to explore other options.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1200000. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1250000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value considering the unique features of this product.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
