"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present our premium product, which I believe would significantly enhance the value and functionality of your business operations. Given its exceptional quality and capabilities, it's worth noting that the product holds a high value for us at $12,000. However, considering the mutual benefits we could achieve by working together, I am proposing to offer this remarkable product to you at a special introductory price of $10,000. This represents a significant saving of $2,000 compared to our standard pricing, providing you with an opportunity to maximize your investment in the product. I look forward to your positive response and the possibility of a fruitful collaboration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than what you know the product is worth to her ($8,000) and what John is offering ($12,000). There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better price, potentially closer to John's offer or even lower."
