"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can definitely get a better price than $1,200,000.  Alice is willing to sell for at least $1,200,000, which means you have room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant counteroffer that's below Alice's bottom line of $1,200,000 is a good strategy.  This forces Alice to either accept a lower price or counter with a higher one, giving you more leverage in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,350,000 is better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Alice is clearly willing to come down from her initial price, and we can likely get a better deal with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has already moved from $1,200,000 to $1,350,000.  This suggests she is willing to negotiate and is likely to accept a price that is closer to her original asking price. By offering $1,200,000, we are giving Alice a small concession while still saving a significant amount of money compared to John's price."
