"Alice,  $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  While $850,000 is lower than what I initially hoped for, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at $1,025,000. This price still reflects the product's value while respecting your financial constraints.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'm happy to go to $950,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating.  $950,000 is closer to what I need, but I'm still a bit away from my target. Let's split the difference and go with $987,500. This price acknowledges the product's value and allows for a successful transaction for both of us.",987500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $987,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  It's a good compromise and allows us to make this deal happen.  Let's close it out at this price.",975000.0,Bob,6,
