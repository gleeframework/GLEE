Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This price is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but it leaves some room for negotiation and ensures that Bob gets a good deal as well. I believe this is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired price point. I believe I can get closer to my goal of $95 by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $90. This is a compromise between my previous offer of $95 and his offer of $85. I believe this price is still fair to both of us and could lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to get a higher price, Bob's offer of $82 is getting too close to John's offer of $80. To avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing even more money, I'm going to sell the product to John."
