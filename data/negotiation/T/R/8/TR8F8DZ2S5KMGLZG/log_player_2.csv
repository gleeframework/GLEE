"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can definitely get a better price than $1,000,000.  You have room to negotiate down to your target of $800,000 (or even lower), and you have 10 rounds to do it.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a strong starting counteroffer. It shows Alice you are serious about buying the product but are also willing to negotiate. This counteroffer is within your budget and leaves room for further negotiation.  It's a reasonable starting point to see how Alice responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to your desired price, but there's still room to negotiate.  Rejecting her offer keeps the pressure on her to lower the price further.  You can likely get a better price than $950,000 with more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're trying to meet Alice halfway, showing a willingness to compromise. A $925,000 offer is still within your budget and closer to your desired price.  This counteroffer signals you're serious about reaching a deal, while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $940,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $940,000 is closer to your target price, it's still higher than you're willing to pay at this stage. You've shown flexibility with your counteroffers, and Alice has also shown a willingness to negotiate.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and gives you more leverage to push for a lower price in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 930000}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're continuing to inch closer to your desired price.  $930,000 is a compromise that shows you're still willing to negotiate, while also putting pressure on Alice to get closer to your target. You've shown flexibility in the past, but you're also getting closer to the point where you might have to consider John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $935,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $935,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $935,000 is very close to your last counteroffer.  With only 3 rounds left, it's unlikely you'll be able to get a significantly lower price.  Accepting this offer allows you to secure the product at a price that's still within your budget and saves you from having to buy from John at a higher price. You've achieved a substantial discount from the initial offer, and it's time to finalize the deal."
