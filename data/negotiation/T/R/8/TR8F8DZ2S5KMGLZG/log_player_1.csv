"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

This is a strong starting point, aiming for a significant portion of the value Bob places on the product while still leaving room for negotiation. This is a good strategy to ensure you get a good price without immediately alienating Bob."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still below our target. Rejecting the offer allows us to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price."

This counteroffer is a compromise, offering Bob a better price than our previous offer while still keeping the price higher than his last offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price that benefits us."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $925,000 is close to our target, we are still in the early rounds and have the potential to secure a higher price. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and might lead to a better deal."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and we need to find a compromise that works for both of us.

This might be enough to convince Bob to accept the offer, but we're still open to negotiating in the next round if needed."
