"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget.  You should reject and attempt to negotiate a lower price.  There's no reason to accept this offer, especially since you can buy the product from John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, but $8,000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $12,000. This is a compromise that should be more acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial $18,000, it's still above your budget.  You can get the product from John for $8,000, so there's no point in accepting this offer.  Continue negotiating to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $8,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to stick to your initial offer, but I'm not willing to go below $12,000. I'll make one more compromise, so I'll offer it to you for $11,000. This is my final concession, so please consider it carefully. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has clearly indicated this is her final offer. While $11,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum willingness to pay.  Since you have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $8,000, it's the most sensible choice to end the negotiation with Alice and buy from John.  There's no point in risking another round of counteroffers with Alice when you can get the product for a lower price from John."
