"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I believe your initial asking price is a little high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000 as a starting point for our negotiation.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is considerably below its true worth.  I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we consider $1,075,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the product's value.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,075,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $985,000? I'm eager to finalize this deal and believe this offer represents a fair compromise.",985000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I've been considering the value this product holds for both of us, and I'm willing to come down slightly further.  Would you be willing to meet me at $1,025,000? This feels like a fair deal where we both benefit.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer!  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000.  I believe this is a very fair offer considering its value and my budget.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,6,
