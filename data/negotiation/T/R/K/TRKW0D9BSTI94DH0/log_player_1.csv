"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $10,000 is too low. I can still get more from him or from John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $11,000 is still a bit too high. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,500? This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  I'm still holding out for a bit more, and I think I can get it.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $10,500 is a good price, but I'm still a little short of where I need to be. Let's meet in the middle.  How about $10,750? That would be a good compromise for both of us, and we could close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $10,750 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,600. This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,600

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $10,600. It's a good price, and I'm not sure I can get a much better offer from him. I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to settle for John's offer of $8,000."
