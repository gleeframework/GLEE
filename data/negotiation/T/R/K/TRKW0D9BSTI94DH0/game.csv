"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you! Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $11,000 is still a bit too high. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,500? This would be a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $10,500 is a good price, but I'm still a little short of where I need to be. Let's meet in the middle.  How about $10,750? That would be a good compromise for both of us, and we could close the deal.",10750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $10,750 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,600. This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this point.",10600.0,Bob,6,
