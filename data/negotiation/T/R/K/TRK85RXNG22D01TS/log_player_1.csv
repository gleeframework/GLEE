"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high price, significantly above my minimum. This is a common strategy in negotiations. It allows me to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  If he accepts this high offer, it means the product is likely worth significantly more to him, and I might be able to push for an even higher price in the future.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** If he rejects, it gives me the opportunity to adjust my offer in subsequent rounds.
* **Show confidence:**  A high initial price shows I believe in the product's value. 

I'll be closely watching Bob's response and adjusting my strategy accordingly."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to settle for a loss. 

Here's why I'm rejecting the offer:

* **Minimum threshold:**  I've already stated the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I can't accept a lower price.
* **Strategic play:**  By rejecting, I demonstrate my commitment to my price range and force Bob to reconsider his offer.
* **Opportunity cost:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is still on the table, so I'm not losing out by rejecting Bob's offer.

I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob by continuing the negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. Here's why:

* **Meeting halfway:** This offer is a significant compromise from my initial price of $1,500,000, showing that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Maintaining my minimum:** It still remains above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, ensuring I don't lose money on the deal.
* **Testing the waters:** This offer allows me to gauge Bob's seriousness and see if he's willing to come closer to my target price. 

I'm still confident I can get a better price, but this counteroffer is a realistic step forward in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I'm rejecting the offer for the following reasons:

* **Minimum threshold:** I've established that the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I'm not willing to sell it for less.
* **Strategic leverage:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product, and I have a backup buyer in John. This gives me leverage to push for a better price.
* **Potential for higher offer:** There's still a chance Bob will increase his offer further, especially if he realizes I won't settle for a lower price.

I'm going to counteroffer again, aiming to get a price closer to my goal while still respecting my minimum threshold."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer but still keeps me above my minimum acceptable price. 

Here's why this counteroffer is strategic:

* **Closing the gap:** It demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate and meet Bob halfway, while still making a profit.
* **Maintaining pressure:** It keeps the pressure on Bob to raise his offer, as I'm not willing to go any lower.
* **Testing the limits:** This price point allows me to see if Bob is genuinely interested in the product or if he's just trying to get a bargain. 

This counteroffer is a calculated move designed to maximize my chances of getting a good price, while also keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd like to get more, it's a fair offer and I'm not willing to risk losing the deal. 

Here's why I'm accepting:

* **Minimum threshold met:**  This offer guarantees I don't lose money and meet my minimum requirement for the deal.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject, Bob might back out entirely, and I'm not sure if I can get a higher price in the remaining rounds.
* **Opportunity cost:**  I'm securing a profitable sale and avoiding any potential delays or complications with selling to John.

I'm happy with this outcome and am ready to close the deal."
