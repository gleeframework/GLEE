"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've already invested a significant amount in the product and I'm not sure I can go as low as $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8250. Would you be interested in taking it for that price?",8250.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $8000, which is my minimum price. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
