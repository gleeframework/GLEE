"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd like to offer you $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair considering the product's value to you, and it's within my budget. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'd like to counteroffer with a price of $1,250,000. This is a compromise between our initial offers, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,250,000 is closer to my budget, but I'm still a bit stretched. I'd like to offer you $1,200,000.  This is the absolute maximum I can afford, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. What do you say?",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit lower than my initial asking price, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'd like to counteroffer with a price of $1,220,000. This is still a compromise, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go any lower.
