"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth considering a price of $12,000 to you, as it's a fair compromise between its value to me and its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $12,000 is within your budget of $15,000.
* Accepting this offer saves you $3,000 compared to buying from John. 

While you could try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, there's no guarantee she'll go lower, and you risk losing the deal entirely."
