# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1150000? This would still leave me with a decent profit, while allowing you a significant discount from my initial offer.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.
