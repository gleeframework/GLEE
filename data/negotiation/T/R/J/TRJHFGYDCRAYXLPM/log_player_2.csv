# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the significant return on investment you'll see.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the value. However, my initial offer reflected the product's unique potential and the significant return you would experience.
