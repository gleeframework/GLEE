I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, aiming to leave room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob, knowing the product is worth $1,200,000 to him, might be willing to meet me halfway.  However, I'm prepared to accept John's offer of $1,500,000 if Bob doesn't come close."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but it's still lower than what I want. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price a bit to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired amount. I believe this counteroffer could be enticing enough for Bob to accept, especially since my last offer was higher than his current one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm willing to keep negotiating with him, as he seems motivated to buy the product. I'll make another counteroffer hoping to close the gap and reach a mutually acceptable price."

I'm making a more significant concession this time, lowering the price to $1,450,000.  This is a considerable drop from my previous offer, and I'm hoping it will finally sway Bob to accept. He's clearly willing to pay close to my minimum, and this offer should be attractive enough for him to consider.  If he rejects this, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is at my minimum price, but I've already made significant concessions and I don't want to risk further negotiations.  John is offering a significantly higher price, which is closer to my desired amount. It's time to secure the deal with John."
