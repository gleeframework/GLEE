"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to stay within your budget. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $16,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $15,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $16,250? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise to get this deal done.",16250.0,Alice,5,
