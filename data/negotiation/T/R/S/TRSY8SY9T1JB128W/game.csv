"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $22,500 is well above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is a fair price considering my value for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to be flexible, how about we meet halfway at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my initial offer of $10,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it lets us close this deal quickly.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to get a reasonable price for this product. $14,000 is my final offer â€“ it's a significant discount and a fair deal for both of us. ",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still beyond what I can afford.  As I said, my maximum is $10,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm ready to buy it now if you're willing to accept.  Let's close this deal.",10000.0,Bob,6,
