Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 99
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $100, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $99 is a common negotiation tactic. It's slightly below my minimum but significantly above Bob's perceived value. This might make him feel like he's getting a deal. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is my initial offer, I'm open to a counter-offer from Bob if he's interested but finds the price a bit high."
