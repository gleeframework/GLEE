"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable. How about $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While $135 is less than your maximum budget, there's a chance to get a better price. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to propose a lower price in a counter-offer."
