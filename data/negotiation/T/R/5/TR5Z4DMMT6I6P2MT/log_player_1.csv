Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable. How about $135?"", 
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $120.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $135 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. It also ensures you make a good profit even if he manages to bring the price down slightly.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have the safety net of John who will buy it for $120, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
