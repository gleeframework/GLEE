Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand we both want a fair deal. How about we settle at $75? That's a good compromise.

Explanation:  Bob is unlikely to offer a price significantly closer to your minimum ($120). It's more profitable to sell to John at your desired price than to continue haggling with Bob."
