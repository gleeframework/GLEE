"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can come to a better agreement. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price.  How about $1,050,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what the product is worth to me.  Let's make this happen.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I would like to stick to my original valuation of the product. I am willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000. This price respects both our perspectives and allows us to move forward with a fair transaction.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
