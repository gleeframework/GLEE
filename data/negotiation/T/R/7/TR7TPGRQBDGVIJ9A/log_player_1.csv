Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's below Bob's perceived value of the product but still offers me a good profit. It's a reasonable starting point and leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested, but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be willing to do $125?  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $125 is still above my minimum price, I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $125 is a good offer, I'm looking for something closer to $135. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135}
