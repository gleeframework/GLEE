"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for a product worth so much more. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's valuation but still leaves room for negotiation. This is a good starting point to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate your product,  $10,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum valuation of $12,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price. I'm still confident I can negotiate a better deal with Bob or sell to John for my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and meet at $9,250? This would still be a great deal for you, and I'd be happy to close the deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum valuation while still being attractive to Bob.  By splitting the difference and offering a clear reason for my counteroffer, I hope to show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate fairly and reach a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is still below my preferred price, it's getting closer to my minimum valuation and it seems like Bob is firm on that price.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a decent profit, especially considering the time spent already.  I can always try to make up for the difference by selling more products to other buyers in the future."
