"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This establishes a clear starting point for negotiation.  Since I don't know Alice's minimum acceptable price, a lower offer gives me room to negotiate upwards if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget of $1,500,000.  While it's getting closer, I can still try to negotiate further to see if I can get a better price. There's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower.  If not, I can always go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $1,400,000. This is still within my budget and is closer to Alice's offer, potentially making it more appealing.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also trying to minimize my costs."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is very close to my maximum budget, there's still room for negotiation. I'm aiming for the best possible price, and there's a chance Alice might be willing to go down to $1,500,000. If not, I can always go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final counteroffer.  It's my maximum budget, and I believe Alice is likely to accept it given her previous offer.  It's a win-win scenario, as I get the product at my target price, and Alice gets a sale.  If Alice rejects this offer, I'll go with John's offer to ensure I acquire the product."
