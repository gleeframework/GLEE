"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product at a reasonable price. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $1,100,000. I would like to make a counteroffer of $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $1,050,000. This feels like a fair compromise.  Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my position, Alice. I appreciate your effort in finding a middle ground. While I understand the value of the product, I still feel that $950,000 was closer to what I'm comfortable with. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. I hope this might be a point we can agree upon.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
