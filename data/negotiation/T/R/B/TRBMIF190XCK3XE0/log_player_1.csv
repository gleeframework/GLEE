Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $100."",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximizing Profit:** While you could start higher, there's a chance Bob might reject anything above his perceived value of $80. By offering it at $100, you're aiming for the highest price he might reasonably accept. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This offer leaves a little wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate further.
* **Guaranteed Alternative:**  You have a safety net with John, who will buy the product for your minimum acceptable price ($120). This means you don't have to desperately lowball Bob."
