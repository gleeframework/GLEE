"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to ensure that I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $1050000. I'm counteroffering at $1150000.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, and I'm happy to keep negotiating. While $1150000 is getting closer, I'm still a bit too high. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm offering $1100000 for the product. This price would allow me to move forward with the purchase and would still represent a significant gain for you.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
