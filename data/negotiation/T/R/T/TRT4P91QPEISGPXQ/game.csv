"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's start at $1,000,000 and see if we can find common ground. ",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, and $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? It's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see that we're getting closer, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but I think that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to accept it.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I understand your need to make a profit, but I can't go higher than $1,050,000.  This is a fair price for both of us. If you can't accept this, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not be able to come to an agreement. I'm willing to make one final offer: $1,080,000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",1080000.0,Alice,7,
