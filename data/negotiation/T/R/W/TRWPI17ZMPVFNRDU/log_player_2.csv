"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first. $120 is a bit too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $90?"",
 ""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

We're starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much wiggle room Alice has. We want to save money, but we also don't want to lowball her so much that she refuses to negotiate."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $110. What do you think?

Alice is negotiating, which is good.  Let's try pushing a little further down before accepting."

 ""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we settle at $100? That's a fair deal for both of us."",

We're getting closer! This offer is right in the middle of our initial offer and her first counter. It signals that we are willing to compromise but still want a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob! However, I'd like to squeeze a bit more value out of the deal. I can sell the product to you for $105. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

This seems like a fair compromise. We're saving $45 compared to John's offer, and Alice is getting a price closer to her value. It's time to close the deal."
