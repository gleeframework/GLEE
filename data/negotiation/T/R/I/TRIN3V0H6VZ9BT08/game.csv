"Alice, I appreciate you offering this product, and I recognize its potential. However, $1000000 is more than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm willing to offer $700000 for it, based on my research and my own valuation.  Let me know if that's something we can work with.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $850000?  This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a fair opportunity to leverage its potential. Let me know if this is something we can work with.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $850000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $800000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",800000.0,Bob,4,
