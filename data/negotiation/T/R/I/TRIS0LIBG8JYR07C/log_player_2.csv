Alice's offer is quite high.  There's plenty of room for negotiation. I should make a counteroffer significantly lower than her initial price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,250?  That's still a great deal for you, considering how much this product is worth. Let me know if you're interested.

While Alice is moving closer to a price I find acceptable, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to nudge the price down a bit further."
