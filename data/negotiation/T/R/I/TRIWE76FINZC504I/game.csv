"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a little high for me.  I'm really hoping to get it for $100.  If you're willing to come down to that price, we can finalize the deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $100, which would be $105. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm hoping to spend.  I'm really serious about buying this product, but my absolute maximum is $100.  Let's make this happen! ",100.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $100. I'm willing to give you a small discount, but I need to make sure I get a decent profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",115.0,Alice,7,
