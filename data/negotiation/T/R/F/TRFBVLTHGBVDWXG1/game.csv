"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $15,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What are your thoughts?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to let it go for $11,000.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle.  However, $11,000 is still a bit beyond what I'm looking to spend.  Could you consider coming down closer to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $7,000 is still lower than I'd like, I'm willing to consider $9,500 as my final offer. This is a significant discount, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated.  $9,500 is tempting, but I'm trying to stay closer to $8,000. How about we settle at $8,500, and we have a deal?",8500.0,Bob,6,
