"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really value. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still above her perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Direct:**  Maintaining a positive tone is important for a successful negotiation. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help me gauge Alice's willingness to move on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you being interested.  $70 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $85?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a price I'm willing to accept, I still have some negotiating power. I'm aiming to get the price closer to $80 before considering accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $78?  That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 78
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  I'm moving closer to Alice's counteroffer with a small increase, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Aiming for a Win-Win:**  A price around $78-80 seems mutually beneficial, giving both of us a reasonable deal. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the compromise, I'm subtly encouraging Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point. $78 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm willing to go down to $82.  That feels like a fair compromise that allows us both to get what we want. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and $82 is within my acceptable price range.
* **Limited Time:**  We are past the halfway point in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk Alice walking away if I push too hard. 
* **Avoiding John:** While I could get the product for $120 from John, securing it for $82 from Alice represents a significant saving."
