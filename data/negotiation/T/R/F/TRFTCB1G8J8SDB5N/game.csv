"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I don't think I can go any higher than that.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm afraid $900000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can do better than that. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a new offer of $950000. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a decision if you can accept it.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your new offer, Bob! However, I'm still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1020000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
