"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially setting the price at $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential ROI. Let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the product, $1,300,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a significant investment for me.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $850,000 is significantly below its true market value and the value it offers. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects its worth.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm comfortable going up to $950,000, which is a significant jump from my previous offer.  This reflects the value I see in the product, but it's the highest I'm willing to go.  Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Bob,4,
