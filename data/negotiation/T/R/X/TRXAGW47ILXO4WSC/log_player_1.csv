Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially setting the price at $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential ROI. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $800,000, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation and potentially achieving a price closer to your $1,000,000 minimum. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high price and encourage Bob to engage in a discussion about its value.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** By asking for Bob's thoughts, you invite him to counteroffer and start the negotiation process.

This strategy balances ambition with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the product, $1,300,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which is still a significant investment for me.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $850,000 is still significantly below your $1,000,000 minimum. You have room to negotiate further. While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, there's potential to get a better deal from Bob with strategic counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $850,000 is significantly below its true market value and the value it offers. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Lowering the price by $150,000 shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, potentially encouraging Bob to do the same.
* **Holding Ground:** The new price of $1,150,000 is still significantly above Bob's offer, but also leaves room for further negotiation before reaching your $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Justification:** By reiterating the product's value, you are reinforcing its worth and justifying the higher price. This might encourage Bob to increase his offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm comfortable going up to $950,000, which is a significant jump from my previous offer.  This reflects the value I see in the product, but it's the highest I'm willing to go.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob increased his offer to $950,000, it's still below your $1,000,000 minimum. Bob has also indicated that $950,000 is his highest offer.  

Continuing negotiations has a low probability of reaching your desired price. It's time to cut your losses and accept John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000."
