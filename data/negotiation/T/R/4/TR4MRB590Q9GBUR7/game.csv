"I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product, and I'm confident it's a price you'll find reasonable.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably pay. I'm happy to offer $9,500. This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it will allow us to reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
