"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing the details further.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer of $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $800,000 for this product, as that's the value it holds for me.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While $2,200,000 represents the premium nature of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  I believe this price reflects a more realistic compromise while still acknowledging its true worth.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,800,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking with my offer of $800,000. This product is valuable to me, but I'm not willing to pay more than it's worth to me. Let's see if we can reach a compromise that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
