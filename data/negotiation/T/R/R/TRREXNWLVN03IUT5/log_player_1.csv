Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can come to a more mutually beneficial agreement. I am willing to pay $790,000 for your product. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I believe I can still get a better price from Bob or John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $790,000 is still below what I need to move forward. I'm willing to come down to $820,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 820000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I would like to propose $805,000 as the purchase price. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that respects the value of the product while keeping costs manageable for me. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $805,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $805,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's only slightly above my minimum price, it's still a better deal than selling to John for $800,000.  It's also a positive step towards closing the deal, and with limited rounds left, it's a good risk to take."
