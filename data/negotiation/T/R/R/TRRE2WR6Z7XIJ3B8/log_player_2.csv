Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but she's also holding her ground above $800,000.  At this point, the difference between continuing to negotiate and potentially getting a slightly better price is outweighed by the risk that she won't budge much more. Accepting at $800,000 secures a significant discount from both Alice's initial offer and John's price."
