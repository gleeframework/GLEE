"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $14,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we settle at $11,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
