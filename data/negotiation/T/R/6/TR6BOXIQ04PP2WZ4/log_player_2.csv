**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  Your goal is to pay no more than $1,200,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I appreciate your willingness to make an offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,300,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.

This is a fair price that reflects a compromise from both sides."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 5

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $1,290,000 is a good price, it's still just a bit outside my budget.

I'm confident this is the price that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1280000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $1,285,000, which is a small concession from my previous offer. I believe this price is fair and reasonable, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.
* **Small price difference:**  Alice's offer is only $5,000 higher than our target price. 
* **Minimizing risk:**  We're guaranteed to get the product for our target price of $1,200,000 from John.  Continuing to negotiate risks us reaching a deal with Alice or running out of time. 

By buying from John, we ensure we get the product at our desired price without risking further negotiation."
