Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000 to make this deal work. This price still reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to benefit.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,250,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I can do $950,000. That's a fair offer considering the market value."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, but that's my final offer.  Think about it â€“ this product can generate significant returns for your business, making this a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down on her price, she's still significantly above your $1,000,000 limit. Her latest offer of $1,100,000 doesn't leave much room for negotiation if she's firm on it being her final offer.  You have a guaranteed option with John at $1,000,000, so it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation with Alice and potentially missing out on both deals."
