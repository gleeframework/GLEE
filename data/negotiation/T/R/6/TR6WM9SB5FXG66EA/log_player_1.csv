Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's well worth the price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than what Bob values the product at, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives us room to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm highlighting the product's uniqueness to encourage Bob to see its worth.
* **Open to discussion:** I'm using an open-ended question to invite Bob to respond and potentially counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  It's also a very low starting point for negotiation. I will reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000 to make this deal work. This price still reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to benefit.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but fair:** I'm rejecting Bob's low offer but demonstrating a willingness to compromise.

* **Focusing on mutual benefit:**  I'm emphasizing the need for a solution that works for both of us, making it seem like I'm prioritizing a win-win outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,250,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. I can do $950,000. That's a fair offer considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's getting closer, I'm not willing to settle for less than my floor price, especially with John as a backup buyer.  I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, but I'm also keeping John's offer in mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $950,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, but that's my final offer.  Think about it â€“ this product can generate significant returns for your business, making this a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's position:** I'm acknowledging Bob's desire for a good deal to show I'm listening.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's potential for profit, reinforcing the value proposition.
* **Setting a firm limit:**  I'm making it clear that $1,100,000 is my final offer, creating a sense of urgency.
* **Focusing on the future:** I'm highlighting the long-term benefits of the product to encourage Bob to think beyond the initial price.

This approach aims to find a middle ground while still safeguarding my minimum acceptable price. I'm creating pressure on Bob to accept by making it clear that this is my final offer."
