"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it would be fair to propose a price of $900,000 for this exceptional item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to me ($900,000 vs. $1,200,000). I have room to negotiate and try to get a better price.  Buying from John immediately would cost me the full value, so I'll try to negotiate with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000. I believe that's a fair price that benefits us both. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** My counteroffer is a compromise, starting with a price that's closer to Alice's offer but still significantly lower than my maximum budget. 
* **Justification:** I provide a reason for my counteroffer, highlighting the potential for a win-win situation for both parties.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** By moving closer to Alice's offer, I signal my interest in a deal while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. In light of your proposal, we would like to counter with an offer of $950,000. This price reflects a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to my desired price, but $950,000 is still too high for me. I want to see if I can push for a lower price before resorting to buying from John. There are still 7 rounds left, so I have time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise,  $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but I need to stay within that budget. Let's find a way to make this work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing a willingness to compromise but still pushing for a better price.
* **Emphasize Budget:** I reiterate my budget constraints, making it clear that I'm not willing to go significantly higher.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive and collaborative tone, suggesting that we can find a solution that benefits both parties."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. Considering your proposal, we would like to counter with an offer of $960,000. This price aims to meet somewhere in the middle of our previous offers, providing a fair value for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:** Alice's offer of $960,000 is very close to my desired price of $975,000. 
* **Limited rounds:**  We're halfway through the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a higher price from John. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While accepting this offer, I can still try to renegotiate some terms or conditions in the future to further reduce the cost."
