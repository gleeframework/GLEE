"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $11,500 for it. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my interest. While the product does seem great, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at the moment. I'm willing to offer $10,500 for it, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which still gives you a good value and allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Alice's offer of $11,000 is still within Bob's budget of $12,000.
* **Potential Savings:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer, leading to a higher price with John. 
* **Compromise:**  Alice has already shown flexibility by dropping her price, indicating a willingness to compromise.

Accepting the offer at $11,000 is the most rational choice, as it secures the product at a reasonable price and avoids the risk of a higher price with John."
