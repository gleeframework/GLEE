"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $800000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since Alice's initial offer is at Bob's maximum price point, it's worth exploring if a lower price is possible. Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $800,000 is my maximum budget. I'm willing to pay $700,000, but I need to see if that's something you're open to discussing. "", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but within reason:** A $100,000 reduction is a significant offer, showing Bob is serious about buying but also pushing for a better deal.
* **Sets the tone:** It establishes that Bob is willing to negotiate and won't accept the initial price without pushing back.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** There's still room for Alice to counter without Bob immediately switching to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe the product's value is worth a bit more than that, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, indicating she is open to negotiation.
* **Reasonable compromise:** $750,000 represents a good compromise, with both parties making concessions.
* **Risk of escalation:**  Further negotiation could lead to Alice becoming more resistant or even increasing her price. Accepting avoids that risk.

While Bob could continue negotiating, the potential gains are small. Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a decent price and avoids the risk of the deal falling through or having to buy from John at a higher price."
