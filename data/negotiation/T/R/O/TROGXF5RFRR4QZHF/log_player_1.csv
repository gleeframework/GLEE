{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts at a price point that's a good compromise between my minimum value and Bob's perceived value. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a good price, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $90?  I'm sure we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum price, and I am confident that I can get a higher price from him if I continue negotiating. However, accepting his offer now will still give me a decent profit, and the risk of losing him completely by rejecting his offer outweighs the potential gain from further negotiation."
