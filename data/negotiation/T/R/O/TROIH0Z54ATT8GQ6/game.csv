"Thanks for the offer, Alice! However, $18,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $10,000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This is my final offer, let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,4,
