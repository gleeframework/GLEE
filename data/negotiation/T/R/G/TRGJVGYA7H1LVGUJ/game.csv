"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $900,000 for the product. I'm confident you'll see the value it brings and be willing to make a deal.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $800,000. I believe this price reflects the value you'll get from the product, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits it brings.",800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer, but $800,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. Would you consider $680,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",680000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to reach a fair price, Bob. However, I've already compromised quite a bit from my initial offer. I'm willing to make one more adjustment. I'm now offering the product to you for $750,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product you'll be getting.",750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $750,000 is still a tough pill for me to swallow.  I'm prepared to offer $700,000, but that's absolutely my limit.  If this doesn't work, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options. ",700000.0,Bob,6,
