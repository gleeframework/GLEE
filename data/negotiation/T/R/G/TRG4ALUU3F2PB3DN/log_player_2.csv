"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $100 by you. Considering its worth and quality, I am offering it to you for $85. This is a special introductory price, and I believe it offers great value for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is a good price, I can potentially get it for even less by negotiating with Alice. I have 10 rounds to work with, so there's room to counteroffer and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to spend closer to $75.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 75} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I would like to counter your offer with a price of $80 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations while still providing a fair return for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $85 to $80, which is a good move in my favor.  While I was hoping for $75, it's not worth risking another round of negotiation and potentially ending up with a higher price or having to buy from John for $100.  I'll take the $80 offer and get the product."
