"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at no less than $1200000 to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation at a price of $1500000.  This reflects the significant value it can bring. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's always wise to start by rejecting an initial offer that's too high. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows you to set a counteroffer that is more in line with your budget."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the product's potential value, $1,500,000 is a bit beyond my budget.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1000000 is not enough for me to part with this product, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm prepared to offer you the product for $1300000,  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and I'm hoping we can find common ground. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but $1150000 isn't quite where I need to be.  To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $1250000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice has come down in price, $1,250,000 is still above your target.  You're trying to secure the product for as close to $1,000,000 as possible.  Rejecting allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price.  There's a possibility that Alice may become more eager to close the deal in the remaining rounds."
