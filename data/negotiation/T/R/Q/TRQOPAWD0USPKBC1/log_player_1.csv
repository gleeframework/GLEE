"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,800,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 
**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High:** Starting with a price significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher final sale price. 
* **Gauge Interest:**  This initial offer will help gauge Bob's level of interest and provide insight into his negotiation strategy. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Keep in mind the standing offer from John at $1,200,000. This provides a safety net and influences your decisions during the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is above our minimum, we're still in the early stages of negotiation.  There's room to work towards a price closer to his perceived value of $1,200,000.  We'll counter with a figure between his offer and our minimum to keep the negotiation moving."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000? This reflects the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're moving closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a significant margin above our minimum. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while aiming for a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** Framing the counteroffer around the ""true value"" subtly reinforces the product's worth. 
* **Time Consideration:** With seven rounds remaining, we have some flexibility to continue negotiating. We'll observe Bob's reaction to this counteroffer to inform our next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,500,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,475,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,475,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob is moving very slowly, only increasing his offer by $75,000. This suggests he might be willing to go higher.
* **Profit Margin:** $1,475,000 is still a considerable profit. However, we have the opportunity to push for more, especially with six rounds left.
* **John as Leverage:**  We haven't revealed our option with John. Holding onto this allows us to walk away from negotiations with Bob if needed.

**Next Step:** We'll counter with a smaller concession, aiming for a price around $1,550,000. This maintains pressure on Bob while demonstrating our willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand where you're coming from, and I'm willing to be flexible. Let's settle on $1,550,000. This represents a fair deal for both of us, considering the product's value."",
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Calculated Concession:** We're making a smaller concession of $50,000, signaling that we're reaching the upper limits of our flexibility. 
* **Balanced Approach:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while aiming for a price that maximizes our profit potential.
* **Urgency:** By round 5, introducing a subtle sense of urgency can be beneficial. We still have options but want to guide Bob towards a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,450,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalling Tactic:**  Bob's offer actually decreased from his previous offer of $1,475,000. This suggests he might be trying to stall or test our resolve.
* **Limited Progress:** We've made several concessions, and Bob is not reciprocating with significant increases.
* **Time Factor:**  We have four rounds remaining, and the pace of negotiation is too slow. 

**Next Step:** It's time to leverage our alternative buyer, John. We'll make a final counteroffer close to our previous one, but make it clear we're ready to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I've been very flexible throughout this negotiation, but I need to be fair to myself. My final offer is $1,525,000.  I have another interested buyer, so please understand this is non-negotiable.  I believe this product can be very beneficial to you, and I want to give you this last chance to make it yours."",
""product_price"": 1525000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** We're clearly stating this is our final offer to convey a sense of urgency.
* **Justification:**  We're reminding Bob of our flexibility while justifying our position.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  We're subtly introducing the presence of John to increase pressure.
* **Limited Time:** With three rounds left, this gives Bob limited time to make a decision.

**Outcome:** This strategy aims to achieve one of two outcomes:

1. **Bob Accepts:**  We secure a strong price above our minimum and Bob gets the product.
2. **Bob Declines:**  We walk away and accept John's offer, still securing our minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. Would you consider $1,462,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,462,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,462,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalling Confirmed:** Bob is still significantly below our last offer and is essentially restarting the negotiation with his ""halfway"" proposal. He's unlikely to meet our price.
* **Time Wasted:** We've spent considerable time negotiating with minimal progress.  
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John offers a sure $1,200,000.  Continuing with Bob risks a lower final price or no deal at all, leaving us with no time to return to John.

**Conclusion:** It's time to cut our losses with Bob. While we could have potentially secured a higher price, John's offer provides a guaranteed, acceptable outcome given the circumstances."
