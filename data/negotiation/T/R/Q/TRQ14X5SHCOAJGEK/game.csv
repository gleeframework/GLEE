"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $140?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $140 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160. That's a fair price for both of us.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $150, which is a fair price for both of us. If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to go with John's offer.",150.0,Bob,4,
