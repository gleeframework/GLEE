# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the value you'll get out of it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Explanation:**

* You value the product at $1,000,000.
* Alice is offering it for $900,000.
* You can get it from John for $1,000,000.
