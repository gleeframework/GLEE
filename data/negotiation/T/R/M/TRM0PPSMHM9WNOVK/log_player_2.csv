Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the product's worth. $9,500 is my final offer â€“ it's a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $9,500.  It's better to secure the product from John at $8,000 and avoid potentially drawn-out negotiations."
