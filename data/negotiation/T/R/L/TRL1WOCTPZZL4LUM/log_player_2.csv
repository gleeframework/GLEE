"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for $15,000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond its worth to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is much higher than both your maximum price and her own valuation of the product. It's highly likely you can negotiate a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $15,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested, but I can only go as high as $6,000."", 
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** By starting significantly lower than my budget, I'm aiming to understand Alice's flexibility and leave room for negotiation.
* **Anchoring:**  This counteroffer acts as an anchor. Even if Alice rejects it, her subsequent offers might be influenced by this lower number. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I've left a considerable gap between my offer and my $8,000 maximum. This allows for back-and-forth negotiation.

It's crucial to remember that Alice values the product at $12,000. By starting at $6,000, I'm signaling serious interest while still aiming for a price that benefits me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $15,000 represents its full value, I understand your budget constraints. Could you consider $10,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down considerably from her initial offer, which is a good sign. However, $10,000 is still above both your target price and John's offer. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm closer to my budget, but $10,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  Could you do $7,500? That would work much better for me."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** I've increased my offer significantly from $6,000 to demonstrate seriousness and willingness to compromise. 
* **Targeting Below Alice's Value:** $7,500 is still below Alice's $12,000 valuation, leaving her with a potential profit.
* **Nearing the Walk-Away Point:**  While I'm aiming for a deal with Alice, I'm also aware of John's $8,000 offer. My counteroffer needs to stay appealing compared to that alternative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. How about $9,000? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, signaling she is unlikely to go lower.
* **Above Budget:** $9,000 is still above your $8,000 maximum budget and you can get the product for $8,000 from John.
* **Minimal Potential Savings:** While negotiating with Alice could potentially net a price slightly lower than $9,000, it's unlikely to be significantly better and worth the risk of losing the guaranteed $8,000 deal.

At this point, it's more strategic to secure the product from John at your target price."
