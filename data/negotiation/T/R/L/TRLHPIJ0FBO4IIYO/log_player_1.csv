"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $125. I think this is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum.  This gives him room to negotiate while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe I can offer you $100 for the product. This aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a more mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about $115? This would still be a good deal for you, and I wouldn't have to sell to John."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position. Would $105 be acceptable for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $105 is closer to my minimum, I'm not yet ready to accept it. I still believe I can get a slightly higher price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to go down to $110. I'm sure you understand that this is already a great deal, and I'm giving you a significant discount.  I'm eager to make a deal, but I'm also firm on this price."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not yet ready to accept it. I have a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I still believe I can negotiate a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal.  However, I'm firm on $108.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to make a good deal.  Let's close this now, or I'll have to consider selling to John."", ""product_price"": 108} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've considered your last offer and am willing to pay $106 for the product. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $106. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $106
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're getting close to my minimum, but with only two rounds left, the risk of not getting a higher offer is too great. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price."
