{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is a better deal than John's offer of $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. You can try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer offers a price slightly above Alice's minimum value of $10,000, giving her a little profit while still saving you a significant amount compared to John's price. It's a reasonable starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is a good deal for you. It's significantly lower than John's price of $15,000 and still gives Alice some profit. There's a high chance that if you reject this offer, Alice might not be willing to go lower, and you'll end up paying $15,000 to John."
