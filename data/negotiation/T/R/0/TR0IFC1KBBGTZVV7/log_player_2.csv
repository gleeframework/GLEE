"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. I understand it's worth less to you than it is to me, but I believe this price offers a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.  I'm confident you'll find this offer appealing. If you decide to pass, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay my full asking price. Let me know your decision.
