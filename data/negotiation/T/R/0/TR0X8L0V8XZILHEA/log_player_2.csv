Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $90 is a bit steep for me.  How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}

Round 3

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $87.50. How about $86?  I'm really close to my budget, and I think this could be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 86}
```"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm close to accepting your offer, Bob! But I still need to make a bit more profit. I'll offer you the product for $89. It's the final offer I'm willing to make. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

```

While $89 is still higher than what you initially hoped to pay, it's getting closer to your preferred price point. You have limited rounds left, and buying from John would cost you more.  It's better to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
