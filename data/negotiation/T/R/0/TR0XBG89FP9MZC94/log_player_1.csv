Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's 50% higher than my minimum value. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob makes a counteroffer.  I'm confident in the product's value and want to see how much Bob is willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but it's still higher than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value, and while I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not confident we can reach a mutually acceptable price. It's better for me to sell to John for $10,000 and guarantee a sale above my minimum value."
