Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $175.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested but $175 is a bit steep for me.  How about $140?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
 I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  $140 is too low, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate you're interested!  $140 is a bit too low for me though.  How about we split the difference and go with $157.50?  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 157.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $157.50 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $152.50.  That's closer to my budget and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $152.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $152.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $152.50 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price of $150, and I'm not sure I can get a better offer in the remaining rounds. I'll accept his offer and sell the product to him."
