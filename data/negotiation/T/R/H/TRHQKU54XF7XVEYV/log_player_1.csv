Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in this product, but  $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me.  Could we settle around $900,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{

Even though Bob matched John's offer, I still have a chance to get a higher price from Bob. I'll try to negotiate a bit further."

Round 6
