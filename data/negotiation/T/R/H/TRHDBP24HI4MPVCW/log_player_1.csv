Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn more than the $800,000 guaranteed from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my desired value, I believe I can still push for a higher price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm offering $950,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a bit more, $925,000 is a good price and it avoids further negotiation.  It's significantly more than what John is offering, and there's no guarantee I'd get a better price if I continue."
