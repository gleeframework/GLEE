"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 was a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $11,000, so I'm offering it to you for $10,000. This is my final compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,
