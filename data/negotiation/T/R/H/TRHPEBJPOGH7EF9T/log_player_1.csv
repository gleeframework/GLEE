Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in. It's something you value at $100, and I'm offering it to you for $120.  This is a fair price considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a fair price for the product, but I'm trying to stay within a certain budget. Can you meet me at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take $90, I'm aiming for a higher price and there are still 8 rounds left to try and close a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your offer is a compromise, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $105. Can we do $97.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $97.5 is closer to my minimum,  I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price. There are still 6 rounds left to get a better deal, so I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $97.50 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get at least $101.25 for the product.  This is a fair compromise considering our previous offers. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 101.25}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get as close to $100 as possible. Can we do $100.50? I think that's a fair compromise considering our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

It's getting close to the end of the rounds, and while $100.5 isn't ideal, it's more than my minimum of $100 and very close to what John is offering.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
