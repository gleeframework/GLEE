"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,175,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. What do you think?",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,5,
