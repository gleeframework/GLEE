Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,175,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. What do you think?

While Alice's offer is closer to my maximum budget, it's still above what I'm comfortable paying. I'll continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that we won't reach an agreement within the remaining rounds.  To guarantee I get the product and avoid the risk of losing out, I'm going to purchase it from John for $1,000,000."
