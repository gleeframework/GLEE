"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be well worth it. Let's try to close this deal.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to hear you're willing to come up a bit. However, $8,750 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,875. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.",8875.0,Alice,5,
