"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I would like to propose a lower price of $10000. I hope this aligns better with your valuation of the item.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, though. How about $10500? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more than my minimum price. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my position, Alice. I understand your perspective, but unfortunately, I am unable to meet at $10500. I would like to propose a price of $10200, which I believe is fair for both parties involved.",10200.0,Bob,4,
