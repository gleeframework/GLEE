Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its features and value, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000.  I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a little high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay around $6,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum.  While I want to find a deal, holding out for a better price is wiser than accepting such a low offer.

Round 3
