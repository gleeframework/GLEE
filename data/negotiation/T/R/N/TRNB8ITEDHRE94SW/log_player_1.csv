"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold strategy, but it sets a high bar for negotiation and could potentially lead to a quick deal if Bob values the product highly.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer and my understanding of his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to try to get closer to my desired amount by counteroffering. I'll need to carefully consider how much wiggle room I have based on Bob's interest and the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It shows I'm willing to be flexible, but I'm also demonstrating that I value the product highly. This middle ground might encourage Bob to accept, especially if he's genuinely interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $900,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's significantly better than selling to John for $800,000. We're getting closer to my desired range, and with only a few rounds left, I want to secure a deal."
