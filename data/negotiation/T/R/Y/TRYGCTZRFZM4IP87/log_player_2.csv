"Round 1

# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to let it go for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You're aiming to save money, and $100 is more than your limit. It's time to counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $100 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $70 right now. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 70}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. I can meet you in the middle at $90. Would you be interested? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $90 is closer to your limit, it's still more than you're comfortable with. You can try to negotiate further and see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product and I'm willing to pay $75. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you at $85. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is within your budget, you can still try to negotiate a lower price. There are still rounds left, and you can always buy from John if you can't reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm at $80. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $80. I'll meet you at $82.50, and that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to your limit, but it's still a bit higher than what you're willing to pay.  You've already reached a point where further negotiation is likely to be difficult.  It's more efficient to buy from John at this point and avoid the risk of more rounds of haggling with Alice."
