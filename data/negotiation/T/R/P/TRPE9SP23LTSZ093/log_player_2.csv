"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not sure $80 is enough for me, Bob. I was thinking more along the lines of $92. It's still a good deal for you, but it's closer to what I'm looking for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go down to $80. It's better to cut your losses and buy from John at this point, rather than potentially wasting more time negotiating with Alice."
