"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $100 simply doesn't cover my costs. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I believe this price is fair considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your efforts to find a fair price. Considering my budget constraints, would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied.  I want to explore if I can get a higher offer before selling to John.  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and gives me another round to try and reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $105 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $112.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and my cost. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 112}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product and your costs, but I am still aiming to keep within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $108? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only four rounds left, the negotiation with Bob isn't progressing quickly enough to get me close to my desired price. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $120, which is more profitable than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
