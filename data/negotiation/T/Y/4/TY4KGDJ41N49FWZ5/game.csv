"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $15,500.  This is the absolute highest I can go, but I hope we can reach an agreement.",15500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,500 is your maximum, Bob. However, I've had other interested parties, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $16,500, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really committed to getting this product, but $16,000 is the absolute highest I can go. Let's see if we can make this happen.",16000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're really committed to getting this product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $16,250, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",16250.0,Alice,5,
