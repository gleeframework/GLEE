Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I know it's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value of the product, giving him room to negotiate. However, it's also significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price, leaving you room to negotiate upwards if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $9,500 for the product.  This still represents a great value for you, considering its worth to you is $8,000. Let's find a compromise we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $9,500 is a good deal for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $9,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price and is still a good deal for Bob. I'm accepting Bob's offer."
