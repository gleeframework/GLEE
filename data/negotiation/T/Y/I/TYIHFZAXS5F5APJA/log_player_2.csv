Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $9,500 for the product.  This still represents a great value for you, considering its worth to you is $8,000. Let's find a compromise we can both be happy with.
