Thanks for offering! That price is a little high for me. Would you consider $65?,65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you think $65 is a bit low for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $90?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $90 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, but $75 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a decent profit. How about $85?",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm glad we're getting closer. How about we settle at $80? That's the absolute highest I can go.,80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $80, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at the midpoint of $80 and my target price. How about $92.50?",92.5,Alice,7,
