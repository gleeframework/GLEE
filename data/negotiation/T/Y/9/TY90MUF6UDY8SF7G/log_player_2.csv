"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as you've mentioned it's worth $12,000 to you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save a bit more.  How about $9,500? That still gives you a good profit, and it's a better deal for me. Let's see if we can close this."", ""product_price"": 9500}
