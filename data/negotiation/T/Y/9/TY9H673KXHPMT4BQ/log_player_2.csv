Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you offering it to me. However, $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'd be happy to buy it for $150, my maximum budget."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I still think this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $165. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $165 is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price. You're looking to save as much money as possible, and it's worth seeing if Alice will come down further.  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering again is the most strategic move at this point."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $165 is still a little outside of my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $155.  If you're willing to meet me there, I'd be happy to purchase it right away."", ""product_price"": 155}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $155. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $160. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $160 is closer to your budget than previous offers, you're still hoping to save more.  You have a few more rounds to work with and John's offer is a good safety net.  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering again gives you the chance to see if Alice will come down further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I'm starting to think we're not going to find common ground.  I really value your product, but unfortunately, I can't go higher than $155. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to look at other options."", ""product_price"": 155}
