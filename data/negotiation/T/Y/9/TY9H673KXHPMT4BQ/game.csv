"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else.",180.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you offering it to me. However, $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'd be happy to buy it for $150, my maximum budget.",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I still think this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $165. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $165 is still a little outside of my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $155.  If you're willing to meet me there, I'd be happy to purchase it right away.",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $155. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $160. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm starting to think we're not going to find common ground.  I really value your product, but unfortunately, I can't go higher than $155. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to look at other options.",155.0,Bob,6,
