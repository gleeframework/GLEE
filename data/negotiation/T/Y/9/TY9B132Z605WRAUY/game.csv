"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and considering its value, I'm asking for $20,000.  What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in the product,  $20,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $16,000 for it.  What do you think?",16000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $16,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value you're getting.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $18,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle at $17,000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",17000.0,Bob,4,
