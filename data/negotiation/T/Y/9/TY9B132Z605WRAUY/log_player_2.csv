"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and considering its value, I'm asking for $20,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save money and the product is worth $15,000 to him.
* Alice's initial offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than Bob's value.
* It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There are still 9 rounds to reach a potential agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in the product,  $20,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $16,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is aiming to save as much as possible, so he starts with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. 
* $16,000 is still above Bob's value, leaving room for further negotiation if needed.
* The message expresses interest in the product while indicating a willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $16,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* While Alice's offer of $18,000 is closer to Bob's value, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.
* There are still 7 rounds left, allowing for more negotiation and potentially getting a better price. 
* Bob should continue to try and negotiate a lower price, especially since he has the option to buy from John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $18,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle at $17,000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is trying to slowly close the gap between his offer and Alice's. 
* Offering $17,000 shows a willingness to compromise while still keeping some room for negotiation. 
* The message emphasizes a desire to reach a fair agreement and close the deal."
