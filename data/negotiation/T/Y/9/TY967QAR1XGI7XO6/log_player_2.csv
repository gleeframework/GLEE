Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is firming up her price and has come down considerably.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she won't budge from $1,050,000. Accepting this offer secures a significant savings compared to John's $1,500,000 price."
