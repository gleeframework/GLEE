"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, around $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While $1,100,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Would you be willing to consider $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
