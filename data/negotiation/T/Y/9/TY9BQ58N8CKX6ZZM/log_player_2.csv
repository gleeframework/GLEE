(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $100?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. I'm getting closer to my budget, but $100 is still a tad steep for me.  Could we settle at $95?"",
""product_price"": 95
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to my target, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $102? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure it's worth it for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $102.  It's a reasonable compromise to save $18 compared to John's offer."
