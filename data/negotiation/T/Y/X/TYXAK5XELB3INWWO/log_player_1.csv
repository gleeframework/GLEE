"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm sure you'll love it. I'm asking for $110 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($100). This leaves room for negotiation. 
* By expressing confidence in the product and offering a friendly greeting, I aim to establish a positive rapport with Bob. 
* This initial offer also serves as a gauge of Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $65 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $100. While I'm open to negotiation, accepting such a low offer would result in a significant loss. 

Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a more reasonable price and continue the negotiation. I still have 8 rounds remaining and can always opt to sell to John for $100 if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $65 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90 to make this work. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm making a significant compromise by lowering my price from $110 to $90. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and find a solution.
* **Clear Communication:**  I'm being upfront and honest with Bob about my minimum acceptable price while still being polite.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** I'm emphasizing finding common ground, signaling that I'm open to further discussion and potentially reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $75 is a step closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $100. Accepting it would mean selling the product at a loss. 

I believe there's still potential for a better deal.  I'll continue the negotiation by making a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to secure a price closer to my desired range.  I can always opt to sell to John for $100 if this negotiation doesn't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $75 is closer, but I'm still not there yet.  How about we settle at $85? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll enjoy the product."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my offer from $90 to $85. This shows Bob that I'm serious about reaching an agreement. 
* **Focus on Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a fair deal for both of us. This helps to create a sense of win-win and increase the likelihood of acceptance.
* **Positive Reinforcement:** I'm emphasizing the value and enjoyment of the product to encourage Bob's acceptance.

I'm still aiming to secure a price closer to my minimum acceptable value of $100, but this counteroffer represents a significant concession.  If Bob still refuses, I will have to weigh the remaining rounds and the possibility of selling to John."
