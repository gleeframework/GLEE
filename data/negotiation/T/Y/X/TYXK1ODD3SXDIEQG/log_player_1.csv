"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'll be very interested in it!  I'm offering it to you for $110.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Testing the Waters:** I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more than his perceived value of $80.
* **Friendly Tone:** Using a friendly tone can help build rapport and encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher Value for John:**  Selling to John guarantees me $100, which is my minimum acceptable price and higher than Bob's offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I still have room to negotiate further and potentially get a better price. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I'm open to negotiation, $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95?  This would still be a good deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Offering to split the difference shows I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my desired value.
* **Focus on Value:**  Highlighting the good deal for Bob can incentivize him to accept.
* **Maintain a Positive Tone:**  Keeping the conversation friendly encourages further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **John's Offer is Higher:**  Selling to John guarantees me $100, which is higher than Bob's offer of $85.
* **Limited Negotiation:** Bob has already dropped his offer twice, and his last offer is below my minimum. 
* **Time Constraint:** There are only six rounds left, and it's unlikely Bob will increase his offer significantly.

It's more beneficial to secure the guaranteed higher price from John rather than risk further negotiation with Bob."
