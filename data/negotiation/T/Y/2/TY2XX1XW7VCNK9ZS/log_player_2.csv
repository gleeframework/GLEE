# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $10,000 is still more than Bob is willing to pay.  He can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his maximum budget.  He can try to counteroffer again or buy from John."
