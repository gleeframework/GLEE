"Hello Bob, I have a unique opportunity to sell you a high-value product that I think you'll love. I'm open to negotiating the price, but I'm starting with an initial offer of $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $11,500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While I'm definitely interested, $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $10,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I think I can do better than that. Let's aim for $11,250. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,250 is still a bit high for me, but I'm sure we can find a middle ground.  How about $10,750?  This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finally finalize this deal.",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I need to think about the value I'm getting out of this deal. Let's try $11,200. It's a slight increase, but I believe it's worth it for the product's value to you.",11200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,200 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm committed to making this deal work, so how about we split the difference and go with $10,950? This is a fair compromise, and we can finally finalize the sale.",10950.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to give up more. Let's try $11,100. It's a slight compromise, but I believe it's worth it for the product's value to you.",11100.0,Alice,9,
