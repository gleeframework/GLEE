"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's negotiate! Alice's first offer is way above my budget. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd need a price closer to $600,000 to make this work."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how Alice responds. This allows for room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below my $800,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. Let me know if this is more to your liking. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice came down in price, but it's still above my limit and John's price. I'll counteroffer again to try and close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. To be honest, my budget for this is closer to $700,000. If you're able to work with that, I think we can make a deal."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

I'm inching closer to my limit, but I want to see if I can get Alice down further before considering John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make sure I'm covering my costs. I'm now offering the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price, considering the value this product brings, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go below $850,000, which is above John's offer.  It makes more sense to buy from John at this point and secure the $800,000 price."
