Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be incredibly valuable to your operations. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll see."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) while ensuring the deal is still attractive enough for him to accept.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,400,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still keeping you well above your minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000).
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This is a single-round negotiation.  We don't know if Bob would counter-offer if the initial price is too high.  Therefore, it's a balance between ambition and ensuring the deal goes through.
* Bob's willingness to pay doesn't guarantee he'll accept any price.  He might have budget constraints or other factors influencing his decision."
