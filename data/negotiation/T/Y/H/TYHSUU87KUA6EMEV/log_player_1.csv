{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $950,000. It's a great opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price to maximize potential profit.  
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to create a sense of urgency and desirability.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.

**Why I'm not starting at the minimum acceptable price:**

* Starting lower risks underselling the product's worth and potentially missing out on a higher offer.
* It's important to create room for negotiation to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Would you consider selling it for $850000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Offer:** Bob's offer is higher than my minimum acceptable price, but there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Avoiding a Quick Sale:** Accepting Bob's offer would be a quick and easy sale, but it might not be the best possible outcome.  
* **Testing the Waters:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to gauge how strongly he wants the product and see if he's willing to come up in price. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but higher than Bob's current offer, aiming for a price between $850,000 and $950,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product for $900,000. This price still reflects the exceptional value this product offers, while giving you a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Appealing to Reason:**  I'm highlighting the product's value again, but also emphasizing the  fairness of my counteroffer.
* **Open-Ended Question:** The question ""What do you say?"" encourages Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget, would you be open to selling the product for $875000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer is just $25,000 below my initial target of $900,000.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk Bob will walk away.
* **Time is Money:**  Accepting the offer allows me to finalize the deal and avoid further back-and-forth.

**Why I'm not rejecting:**

* I'm not sure if I can get a better offer from Bob, and the risk of him walking away is too high.
* While I'm still $50,000 below my initial asking price, it's a significant amount of money for this unique product."
