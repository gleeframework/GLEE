"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is too low for me to consider. Could you meet me halfway at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  While $15,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $13,250?",13250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, we're getting close. I can see you're firm on your price, but I need to stay within my budget.  Would you consider $12,000? That's the absolute highest I can go.",12000.0,Bob,6,
