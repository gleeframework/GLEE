"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to get a better price from Alice first.  We have room to negotiate before hitting our $150 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit steep for me. Could you do it for $110?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Interested:** The message expresses interest while still making it clear we want a lower price.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counter-offer positions us well. Even if Alice rejects it, we have a good chance of meeting somewhere in the middle, well below our $150 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, but $110 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $120 is a solid price, saving us $30 from our maximum and representing a decent compromise. 
* **Minimal Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield small gains, and we risk Alice backing out or the negotiation taking too long."
