"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to you, but I'm willing to start negotiations at $140. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to buy significantly below Alice's perceived value and our own maximum price. Starting with a lower offer gives us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Engaged:** The message expresses interest and a willingness to negotiate, which is important for a successful outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'd like to counter your offer at $125. This is my final offer before considering other buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is Anchoring:** Alice is trying to anchor the negotiation closer to her initial offer.  While $125 is closer to our goal, we still have room to negotiate, especially since she mentioned this is her ""final offer"" before considering other buyers (a common negotiation tactic).
* **We Have Time:** It's only Round 3, and we have several rounds left to try and reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $115? That's a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This is a classic negotiation tactic that can feel like a win-win to both parties. It shows flexibility on our side while still moving us closer to our target price.
* **Creating Urgency:** By suggesting a compromise, we subtly imply that this is a good deal that Alice should consider before walking away. 
* **Maintaining Politeness:** We want to keep the tone positive and collaborative, even while negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're finding common ground here, Bob. Considering your offer, I would like to counter at $120. This is my best offer, as it's very close to what I'm willing to accept while still allowing me to maximize my earnings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:**  Alice has signaled very strongly that $120 is likely her lowest acceptable price. She's framed it as a price that benefits both of us. Pushing further could make her walk away. 
* **Good Deal:** While we could try to negotiate a few dollars less, $120 is a solid deal. It's significantly below our maximum price and Alice's initial offer.
* **Time Considerations:** We've already used half our rounds. While we have time for more back-and-forth, there's no guarantee of getting a better price from Alice."
