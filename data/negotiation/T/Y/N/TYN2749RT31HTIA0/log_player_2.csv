"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. I think this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for a better price from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand it's a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle. I'll accept $9000 for the product.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. While $9,000 is closer to Bob's maximum, it's still above his goal price. John offers the product for $8,000, which is within Bob's budget and a better deal than Alice's latest offer."
