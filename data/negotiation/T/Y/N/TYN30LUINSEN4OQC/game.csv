"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $125 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good deal considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen!",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and settle on $140. This seems like a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to purchase the product within my budget.",140.0,Bob,4,
