Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a sample offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential $200,000 profit margin for Bob.

**Strategy**

You want to capture as much of that $200,000 as possible. Offering a price too close to $1,000,000 leaves money on the table. Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 risks Bob rejecting the offer.

**Sample Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair and reflects the significant return on investment you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You're not starting low and inviting haggling.
* **Value Emphasis:**  You highlight the ""return on investment"" to justify the price.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 leaves Bob with a potential $50,000 gain, making it likely he'll accept while maximizing your profit.

**Important Notes**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  You don't know if Bob has other options. A confident opening sets the tone.
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer.  You have room to negotiate down slightly from $1,150,000 if needed."
