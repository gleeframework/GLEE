"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair and reflects the significant return on investment you'll see. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is above her own valuation, it's still less than your maximum price of $1,200,000 and significantly better than buying from John. Accepting this offer saves you $50,000."
