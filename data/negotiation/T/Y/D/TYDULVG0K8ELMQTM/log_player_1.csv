{""product_price"": 950000}

I'm starting with a high offer, but one that leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay close to the value he places on the product. This is a good starting point for maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a profit closer to my target price. I believe this counteroffer will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price while still leaving some room for negotiation."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's time to sell to John. While I'm disappointed that I couldn't get a higher price from Bob, continuing to negotiate would only waste time. John is a guaranteed sale at $800,000, which is my minimum. I'm confident that John will be a good customer, and I can focus on finding other buyers for my products in the future."
