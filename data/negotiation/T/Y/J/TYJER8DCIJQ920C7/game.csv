"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that will benefit your business greatly. I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What are your thoughts?",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I acknowledge the value of the product, $750,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm prepared to offer $700,000 for the product, which is still within a reasonable range considering its potential benefits. I'm confident this price represents a fair compromise. Let me know your thoughts.",700000.0,Bob,2,
