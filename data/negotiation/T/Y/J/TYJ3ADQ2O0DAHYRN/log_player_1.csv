"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and making it seem like a good deal for Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer, but I'm setting the initial price high enough to maximize my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe I can offer you $95 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While $95 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **More negotiation room:**  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to my target.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $100 gives me the confidence to push for a better price from Bob without fearing losing out entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from the initial $110.
* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm suggesting a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **Positive message:**  I'm still emphasizing a desire to close the deal and finding a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I would like to propose $100 for the product. I hope this meets your expectations and we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $100 meets my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No further room for negotiation:**  While I could try to push for a higher price, it's unlikely Bob will budge further, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal.
* **John's offer is the same:** Selling to John at this point would result in the same profit, so there's no advantage to going that route. 

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and secure sale at my minimum acceptable price."
