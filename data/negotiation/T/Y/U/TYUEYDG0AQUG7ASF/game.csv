"I'm really interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $22,000 is closer to its true market value. Could you meet me halfway at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with $17,000. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,4,
