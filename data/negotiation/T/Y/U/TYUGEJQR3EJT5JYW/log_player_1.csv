Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $170. This is above Bob's value but still gives him room to negotiate. If he rejects, I can then adjust my offer based on his counteroffer.  It's a good starting point to maximize my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $130 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm offering $145. It's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.  This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still securing a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still below my desired price, it's higher than his previous offer and close to my minimum.  Continuing to negotiate might result in further delays and the risk of Bob backing out altogether.  Selling to John for $150 is also an option, but accepting this offer is quicker and guarantees a sale."
