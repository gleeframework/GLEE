"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product at a competitive price of $14,000. I believe it would bring significant value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the product is worth significantly more to both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** $13,250 is cheaper than $15,000.
* **Alice is willing to negotiate:** This shows she's flexible and might be willing to come down further.
* **Meeting in the middle:** Accepting this offer demonstrates a willingness to compromise, while still achieving a lower price than her initial offer. 

By accepting, Bob secures a good deal without risking further negotiation and potentially ending up paying more with John."
