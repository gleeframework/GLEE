"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $750,000 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable to you.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $825,000?  This would still give you a great deal on the product, and it's a fair price for me. What do you say?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I must respectfully decline your offer of $825,000. I am still unable to go above $750,000 for the product. However, I am open to discussing other potential arrangements or terms that might be mutually beneficial. Please let me know if there's anything else we can consider.",750000.0,Bob,4,
