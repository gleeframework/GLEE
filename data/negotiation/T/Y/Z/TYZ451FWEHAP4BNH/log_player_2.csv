"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's a fair price while still allowing me to get a good return on my investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  He can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price.  There's also room to negotiate with Alice, as she values the product at $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  That's still a good deal for you, and it's the most I can afford.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $1,100,000 to make this worthwhile.  This is a significant investment for me, and I need to ensure I can recoup my costs. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can still get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price.  While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,075,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away with a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,075,000 is still not enough for me to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,087,500. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I hope you'll consider it seriously. Let's work together to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,087,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's offer is still higher than what John is offering, and Bob has already made several counteroffers. It's likely that further negotiation will be unproductive, and it's better to secure the product at the lower price from John."
