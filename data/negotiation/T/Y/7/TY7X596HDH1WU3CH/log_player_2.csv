"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $130 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is above my maximum budget. I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This gives me room to negotiate upwards if needed, while still aiming for a price well below my maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, which is good.  However, I can still try to get the price closer to my ideal range. It's worth another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  How about $105?  That seems fair to me."",
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

I'm inching closer to her price, but still leaving room for further negotiation. This counteroffer represents a reasonable compromise in my mind."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. Let's try $110. I'm confident you'll find the product worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is negotiating in good faith and this offer is only $10 above my ideal price.  It's unlikely I'll secure a significantly better deal with further haggling, so it's time to accept."
