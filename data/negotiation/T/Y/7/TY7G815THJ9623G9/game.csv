"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. Let's start with a fair price. How about $100 for this exceptional product?",100.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. To find common ground, how about we meet in the middle at $92 for the product? This respects both our valuations while moving forward with the transaction.",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $92 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a more substantial offer. How about $87 for the product?",87.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob. Let's try $90 as a compromise. This is a fair price considering both our perspectives. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to accepting, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $88, but that's my final offer. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",88.0,Bob,6,
