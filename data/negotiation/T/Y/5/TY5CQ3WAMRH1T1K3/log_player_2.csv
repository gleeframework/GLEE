"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for $800,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price.  He should counteroffer Alice and see if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.

Bob should buy the product from John. While Alice has come down in price, it's still higher than what Bob can get from John. There's no need to continue negotiating with Alice when a better option is available."
