"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is better than $1,200,000, it's still more than Bob's ideal price of $800,000. There's room for negotiation, and it's worth trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing a clear intent to negotiate.  It's also within Bob's maximum budget, giving Alice some room to accept.  Starting with a lower offer increases the chance of getting a better price in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than Bob's desired price. While it's closer to the $800,000 goal, it's still not ideal. It's worth continuing to negotiate and pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from Bob's previous offer, showing flexibility and willingness to compromise. It also keeps the price below the $900,000 mark, leaving room for further negotiation if Alice rejects it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, she's still far above Bob's desired price.  Continuing the negotiation is the best option at this point, as Bob has a few more rounds left to try and reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a significant jump from Bob's previous counteroffer, demonstrating his willingness to compromise while still keeping the price below Alice's latest offer. It also represents a reasonable price point considering Alice's previous offers and Bob's maximum budget. This should put pressure on Alice to accept, as she's likely to get a lower price than her initial offer if she continues to reject."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,005,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,005,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is actually higher than her previous offer.  This suggests she's not very flexible.  With only three rounds left, the risk of not reaching a deal with Alice is high.  It's better to cut losses and buy from John at a fixed price of $800,000, ensuring a purchase within Bob's budget."
