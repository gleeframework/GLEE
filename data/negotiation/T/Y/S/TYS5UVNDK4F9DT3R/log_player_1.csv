Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob at $1,000,000. This is the minimum amount I'm willing to accept, as it reflects the product's value to me. If Bob rejects this offer, I'm confident I can sell it to John for the same price. This strategy maximizes my chances of getting the best price possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below the value of the product to me. I'm going to counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my target price before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob at $950,000. This is a compromise that demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the product's inherent value.  I believe this offer is attractive enough for Bob to consider, but it also keeps me closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $925,000.  While it's still below my ideal price,  it's a good compromise and ensures I don't risk losing the sale completely by continuing to negotiate. Selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, but the negotiation with Bob has shown that I can get a reasonable price with some flexibility."
