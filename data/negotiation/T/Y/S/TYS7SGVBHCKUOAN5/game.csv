"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm working with a tighter budget.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm still confident the product's value is worth more than $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my budget. To be completely transparent, I have the option to purchase a similar product elsewhere for $800,000. If you'd be willing to come down to that price, I'd be happy to close the deal with you today.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you have other options, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go down to $800,000. I'm still confident the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $815,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can see the value in the product at this price.",815000.0,Alice,5,
