# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you have other options, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go down to $800,000. I'm still confident the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $815,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can see the value in the product at this price.

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has made it clear she won't go down to our ideal price of $800,000.  While we could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee she'll budge, and we risk losing out on the guaranteed price from John. It's in our best interest to take the sure thing and buy from John at this point."
