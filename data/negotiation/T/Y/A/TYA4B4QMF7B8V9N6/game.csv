"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll be willing to pay a premium for it. I'm willing to let it go for $2000000. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2000000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value and allows for a profitable deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1500000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1750000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1750000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to go up to $1600000, which is a fair price given our previous discussions.  Let's aim for a swift agreement.",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to meet you at $1650000, but I think we can do better than that. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. Let's aim for $1675000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great deal for both of us.",1675000.0,Alice,5,
