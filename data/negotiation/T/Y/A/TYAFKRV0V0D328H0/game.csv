"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $950,000 is above my current budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This price reflects the product's worth while leaving room for both of us to benefit from the transaction. I'm open to further discussion, but I need to stay within this price range.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. After careful consideration, I understand your position and am willing to negotiate further. Considering the product's value and market positioning, I propose a revised price of $900,000. This still maintains a significant profit margin for us while acknowledging your budget constraints. I look forward to your feedback on this proposal.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.  I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value and my budget. Let's see if we can close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
