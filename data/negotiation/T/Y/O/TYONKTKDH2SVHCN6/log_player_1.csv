Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get closer to my target price.  $120 is too low, but it's a good starting point for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $145?  I think it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $130 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still aiming for a higher price, but Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum. I'll counter with a slightly lower price to try to close the deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I respect that. Let's try $135. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but this is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $135, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $125 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $150. Bob's offers are getting closer, but I'm concerned that we may not be able to reach a mutually agreeable price before we run out of rounds. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum target price and avoids the risk of having to settle for less."
