"Bob, I've made several concessions, and I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a fair price. However, I still need to make a significant profit to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counteroffer at $1075000. This is my best and final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
