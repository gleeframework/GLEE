"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $9,500.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. It's much closer to my maximum budget than her valuation. I should counter with a significantly lower price to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $7,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  Could you meet me halfway at $8,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but $8,500 is still too high. I'll counter with a price closer to her valuation, but leaving some room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you consider $7,750? I think that's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 7750
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $8,125? This feels like a fair price that acknowledges both of our positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is definitely getting closer to a price I'm happy with, but I think there's still room for negotiation. I'll try one more time to see if I can get it a bit lower before considering accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, you're getting close! I could potentially do $7,900.  That's a big jump for me, but I'm very interested in the product."",
""product_price"": 7900
}
