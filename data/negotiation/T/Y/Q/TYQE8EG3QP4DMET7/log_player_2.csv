# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $950,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I understand your perspective, $950,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer. I'm open to negotiation but need to land closer to my valuation. Would you be willing to consider $1,050,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I can go at this time.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  This would allow both of us to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
