"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $2,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's better to reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You can always fall back to John's offer if negotiations with Alice fail."

{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it and my own budget constraints. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the product's value significantly exceeds that price point. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your budget. You can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  You're still better off with John's offer, but it's worth seeing if you can squeeze a lower price out of Alice."
