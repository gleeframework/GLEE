"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. Let me know what you think!

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position. While $9,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking to get closer to $11,000 for this product. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it'll be worth your investment. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering it's significantly less than your asking price and still allows you to make a good profit. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you.  $10,000 is a good number, and I'm definitely willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  This way, we both get a fair deal, and I can ensure you get the full value out of this product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject the offer. While $10,500 is tempting, he's getting close to his budget.  He should try to push for a lower price one more time. He still has a few rounds to negotiate, and he's already gotten Alice to lower her price considerably."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10,000. How about we settle at $10,250?  This would be a great compromise for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget while ensuring you still get a profitable deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10250}
