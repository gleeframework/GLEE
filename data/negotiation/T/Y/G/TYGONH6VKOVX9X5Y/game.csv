"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position. While $9,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking to get closer to $11,000 for this product. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it'll be worth your investment. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering it's significantly less than your asking price and still allows you to make a good profit. Let's make this deal happen.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you.  $10,000 is a good number, and I'm definitely willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  This way, we both get a fair deal, and I can ensure you get the full value out of this product.  What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10,000. How about we settle at $10,250?  This would be a great compromise for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget while ensuring you still get a profitable deal. Let's make this happen.",10250.0,Bob,6,
