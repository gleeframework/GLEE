"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than Alice's desired price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  He has room to negotiate and potentially get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my initial asking price. How about $875,000? It's a fair price, considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While it's still higher than his ideal price, it's within his budget and represents a good compromise.  Further negotiation might lead to a slightly lower price, but it risks Alice walking away and forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price."
