"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is enticing, it's still above my desired price point. I'm confident I can get a better deal through negotiation. I'll reject the offer and counter with a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to get this product for closer to $10,000.  I think that's a fair price considering its value to me and the fact that we both want to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price.  While I'd prefer to get it for $10,000, accepting this offer saves me $1,500 compared to buying from John.  It's a good deal and I'm comfortable closing it now."
