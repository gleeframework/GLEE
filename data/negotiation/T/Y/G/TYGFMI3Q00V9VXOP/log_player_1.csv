Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to get this product for closer to $10,000.  I think that's a fair price considering its value to me and the fact that we both want to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.
