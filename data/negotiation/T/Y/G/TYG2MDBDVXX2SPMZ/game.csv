"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its worth to me is much higher. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  However, $6,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $9,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000. Would you be open to that?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're making progress.  While I appreciate your offer, $7,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? It's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
