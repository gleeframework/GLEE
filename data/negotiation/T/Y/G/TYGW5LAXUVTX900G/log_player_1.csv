"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm offering it for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is a decent price, I'm aiming for higher. I'll counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  I can come down to $95.  That's still a fair price for the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Can you meet me at $85? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my target price, Bob's offer of $85 is only $5 below my minimum.  It's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing him and ending up selling to John for $80."
