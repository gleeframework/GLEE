"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get this product at a discounted price, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $12,000, while John wants $15,000. 
* **You're still saving money:** Even at $12,000, you're getting the product for less than your maximum budget of $15,000. 

Therefore, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer to save $3,000."
