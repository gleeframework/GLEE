Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for this product, but I won't go any higher.  Let me know if that's acceptable to you.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1250000 is still too high for me. I'm confident this product is valuable, but I'm sticking to my offer of $1000000.  This is the absolute maximum I can pay.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 
I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  Bob's been insistent on his offer, and I'm running out of time.  I'd rather secure a guaranteed sale than risk further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or a deal falling through altogether."
