"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think you'll find it very useful. I'm asking for $200 to start. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks Alice, but $200 is too high for me. I'm only willing to pay $100 for this product. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, but $100 is quite low for this product. It's high quality and I'm confident you'll get a lot of use out of it. How about we meet in the middle at $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $160 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $120, but that's my final offer.  If it's not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $145.  This is my final offer, as it's already a very fair price for this product.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $130. If that's not acceptable, I'm going to have to buy from John.",130.0,Bob,6,
