"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit below what I need to move forward.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $1,050,000.  I believe this price fairly reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I've considered your latest offer and while I understand the value of the product, I am unable to go above $975,000. This feels like a fair compromise given our previous discussions. I hope you find this offer acceptable.",975000.0,Bob,4,
