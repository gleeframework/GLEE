Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $9,750 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,250. If we can meet in the middle here, I think we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:

```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very slowly lowering her price. It's unlikely she'll go below $10,000, which is the price John is offering.  At this point, it's more efficient to cut negotiations with Alice and secure the product from John at your target price."
