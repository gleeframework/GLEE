"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let's start the conversation! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  $1,150,000 is still too high for him, considering he values the product at $1,200,000.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close this deal without further delay. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much as possible. $1,100,000 is closer to his desired price, but he can likely negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer gives him another chance to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. That's a significant compromise on my end. Let's try to close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm going to stick to my previous offer of $1,100,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's the best way to close this deal quickly. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still determined to get the product for a lower price than $1,100,000.  He's already made a significant compromise by going up to $1,075,000.  He's only had 5 rounds, so there's still time to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer keeps the door open for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,085,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1085000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see your point, but $1,085,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on my last offer.  How about $1,092,500?  This feels like a reasonable compromise, and it allows us to move forward with this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,092,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,092,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is running out of time and negotiation rounds. While $1,092,500 is still higher than his desired price, it's a reasonable compromise considering the limited time remaining. If he rejects this offer, he risks losing the deal with Alice and being forced to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting the offer allows him to secure the product at a price within his budget."
