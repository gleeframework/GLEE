"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close this deal without further delay.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. That's a significant compromise on my end. Let's try to close this deal.  What do you say?",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm going to stick to my previous offer of $1,100,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's the best way to close this deal quickly. Let's meet in the middle!",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,085,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal. Let's make this happen.",1085000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I see your point, but $1,085,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on my last offer.  How about $1,092,500?  This feels like a reasonable compromise, and it allows us to move forward with this deal.",1092500.0,Alice,7,
