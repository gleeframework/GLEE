,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $140 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a good deal on this.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $130 is still a bit lower than where I need to be, but I'm willing to go down to $135 to make this deal work.  This is a great product that I'm sure you'll enjoy, and I want to make sure we both walk away happy.  Let's close this deal!",135.0,Alice,5,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125, which is the lowest I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle and make a deal.",125.0,Bob,6,
