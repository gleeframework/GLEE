Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product ahead of other interested buyers. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to let it go for $11,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $12,000, selling to Bob at a higher price earns more profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting us closer to our $12,000 baseline.
* **Urgency and Value:**  The message creates a sense of urgency and highlights the product's value to Bob, increasing the likelihood of acceptance."
