**Reasoning:**

Bob has been incredibly consistent in his valuation and unwillingness to budge above $1,500,000.  At this point, continuing negotiations is unlikely to result in a significantly better offer. It's time to cut losses and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, rather than risk Bob walking away and getting stuck with a worse outcome."
