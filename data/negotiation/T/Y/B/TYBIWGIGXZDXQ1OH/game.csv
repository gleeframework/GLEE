I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. My initial offer is $1500000.,1200000.0,Alice,1,,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,
"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. Can we meet in the middle at $1100000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your interest, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If that's not acceptable, I'm open to further negotiations."
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I've already compromised by not going for the initial $1500000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $1200000, so my new offer is $1300000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1300000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1050000. Can we meet in the middle at $1150000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not comfortable going down to $1150000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. My next offer is $1250000, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options."
"I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. Considering we're already at $1250000, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. I can offer you a deal at $1220000. This is my final compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for the product's value.",1220000.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $1180000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1180000.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,"I understand you've made a final offer, Bob, but I'm not comfortable with $1180000. I've already compromised significantly, and I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm going to hold out for the best possible deal. I'm not making any further concessions. I'll wait for your next move."
"I'm not willing to budge further, Bob. My initial offer of $1500000 was a good starting point, and I've compromised significantly since then. I'm willing to make one last attempt to find common ground. My next offer is $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to John.",1200000.0,Alice,7,,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,
"I understand you're not willing to budge further, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I can meet you at $1190000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1190000.0,Bob,8,,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I've already made it clear that $1200000 is my minimum. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. I'm starting to think that selling to John might be the better option for me. I'll hold out for the best possible deal."
"I've made it clear that $1200000 is my minimum, Bob. I'm not willing to negotiate further. I'm giving you one last chance to meet my minimum price. If not, I'll be forced to consider other options. My final offer is $1200000, and I expect a decision from you now.",1200000.0,Alice,9,,
