"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $95. This is a high-quality item worth more than $100 to you, and I believe this price reflects its value while allowing us to maintain a fair profit margin. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a good deal, Bob can potentially save more money by counteroffering. The product is worth $100 to Bob, so there is room for negotiation.  By rejecting the initial offer, Bob can explore the possibility of getting a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this moment. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product, as it aligns with my budget and the value I perceive for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we agree on a price of $90 for the product? This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while being more accommodating to your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price point. While $90 is still more than Bob's initial counteroffer of $85, it's a significant improvement from the original $95.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to save $10 compared to buying from John and still get a good deal."
