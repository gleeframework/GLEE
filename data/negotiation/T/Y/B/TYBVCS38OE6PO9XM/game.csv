"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this moment. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product, as it aligns with my budget and the value I perceive for it. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we agree on a price of $90 for the product? This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while being more accommodating to your budget.",90.0,Alice,3,
