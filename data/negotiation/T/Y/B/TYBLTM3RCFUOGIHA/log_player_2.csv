You can get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  $1,400,000 is still too high, as it's above your maximum budget."

You're still closer to your goal of saving money by rejecting Alice's offer. $1,325,000 is still a bit higher than what you're willing to pay.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John."
