"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $175 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $140 for it. What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $175 is a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $160? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $160 is closer to what I can afford, I'm still a bit over budget. Would you be willing to go down to $150? That's my absolute maximum, but I'm sure we can both agree it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",150.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I've already gone down to $160 from my original price of $175. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $155? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",155.0,Alice,5,
