"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit your business. Considering its value to us and the potential it holds for you, I propose a price of $950,000 for the product.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product and the market conditions, I am willing to lower the price to $825,000. This still allows us both to benefit from the transaction.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $825,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at this price.",800000.0,Bob,4,
