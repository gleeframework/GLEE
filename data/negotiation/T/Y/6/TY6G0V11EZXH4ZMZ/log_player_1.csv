Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $9,500. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting in the middle.
* **Secure a Good Deal Quickly:** A strong initial offer might encourage Bob to accept without dragging out the negotiation, ensuring Alice doesn't have to resort to John's lower offer. 

This strategy balances ambition with a degree of realism, increasing the likelihood of a profitable sale."
