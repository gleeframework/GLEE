"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $95. This still gives me a decent profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement here.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $80 is a bit low for you, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $95. How about $87.50? Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $87.50 is still a little too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a fair price that would allow us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $90. I'm willing to go up to $88, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",88.0,Bob,6,
