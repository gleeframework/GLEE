Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, playing the role of Alice:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm asking for $11,500. Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:**  You have insider information that the product is worth $12,000 to Bob. This is a significant advantage.
* **Leaving Room for Profit:**  Offering the product at $11,500 leaves you with a profit of $1,500 ($11,500 - $10,000). This is a significant gain compared to selling to John.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer.  By pricing it slightly below his perceived value, you increase the chances of him accepting while still maximizing your potential profit. 
* **Framing the Offer:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob and presents the offer as exclusive, potentially making it more enticing."
