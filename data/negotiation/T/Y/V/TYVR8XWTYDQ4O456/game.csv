"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. To make this work, I'm offering $1,075,000. This price reflects a significant discount from your original offer and represents a fair compromise. I'm confident that we can reach an agreement at this price, benefiting both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
