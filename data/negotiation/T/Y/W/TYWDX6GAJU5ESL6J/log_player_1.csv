Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant returns you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Room for negotiation:** The offer leaves some space for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification for price:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" aims to frame the price as justified, even though you haven't explicitly revealed the product's worth to you. 

**Goal:** The aim is to secure the highest possible price from Bob, knowing you have a safety net with John."
