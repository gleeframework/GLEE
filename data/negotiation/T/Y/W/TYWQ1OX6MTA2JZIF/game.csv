"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $150 to you! What do you say?",140.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $140 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to go down to $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  Let's compromise.  How about $125?  That's still below your perceived value and closer to what I need.  What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $117?",117.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating.  I can't go lower than $120, as that's my minimum.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $118.50?  That's a good price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",118.5,Alice,5,
