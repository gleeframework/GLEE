"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe it would be of great value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Buying from Alice at $140 saves you $10 compared to buying from John at $150.
* **You still get a good deal:** Even though you're paying more than the product is worth to Alice, you're still getting it for less than your maximum price of $150."
