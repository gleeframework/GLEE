Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $110. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. I'm also using a friendly and positive tone to encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to do? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell it for such a low price. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I understand your offer, $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. Would you be interested in paying $95 for the product? Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $80. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90? That seems like a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still trying to stay close to my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $82.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $82.5 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price.  I believe I can do better by continuing to negotiate with Bob. I'm not quite ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $82.50 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to go down to $87.50. This is a fair compromise and a good price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 87.5} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $82? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $100. We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds and I'm not convinced I'll be able to get a price from Bob that meets my minimum.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to go below my minimum price. John is a reliable buyer and I'm happy to sell to him."
