"Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I understand your offer, $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. Would you be interested in paying $95 for the product? Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",95.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $80. Would you be willing to meet me at $85?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90? That seems like a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!",90.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $82.50 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to go down to $87.50. This is a fair compromise and a good price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen!",87.5,Alice,7,
