Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. To show my genuine interest, I'm willing to offer $1,250,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
