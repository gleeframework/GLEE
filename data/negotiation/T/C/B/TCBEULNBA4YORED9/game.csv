"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussions.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. To show my genuine interest, I'm willing to offer $1,250,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the inherent value of this product.  While your offer is tempting, I believe it undervalues its true potential.  Let's meet closer to the middle - how about $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your perspective on the product's value, but  $1,325,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a fair compromise that shows I'm serious about acquiring this product.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
