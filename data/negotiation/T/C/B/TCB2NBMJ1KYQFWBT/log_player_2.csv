"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our top-of-the-line product! It's a fantastic opportunity to get your hands on this unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. I think this is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is a good deal, I want to see if I can get it for even less.  I'm going to reject Alice's offer and try to counteroffer to save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down to $9,000, but I'm still looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,800. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my target price, and I'm only $800 away from my desired price of $8,000. It's a risk to reject and counteroffer again, as Alice might become less flexible.  Accepting the offer at $8,800 still saves me $3,200, which is a good deal."
