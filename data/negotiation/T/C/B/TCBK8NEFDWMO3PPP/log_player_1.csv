Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."

While $8,750 is closer to my minimum, I'm still within my rounds to push for a slightly higher price. I'm hoping that by rejecting this offer, I can get Bob closer to my ideal price of $9,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,750 still isn't quite what I'm looking for.  How about $8,900?  It's a compromise that gives you a great deal, and allows me to get closer to my minimum.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 8900}

**Reasoning:**

I'm still within my rounds and Bob is getting closer to my minimum. While $8,500 is tempting, I'm going to try to push for a slightly higher price. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach a compromise."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $8,600, but I'd really love to get it for $8,500. Can you meet me at $8,500?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're at round 8, and while I'd like to push for a slightly higher price,  I need to be realistic.  $8,500 is just slightly below my minimum, but it's a good deal considering the time we've spent negotiating.  Plus, I'm running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
