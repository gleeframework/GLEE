"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $100. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a reasonable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $100 is still too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! However, $100 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $65? I believe that's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 65
}
```

This counter-offer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but still leaves room for negotiation. By being polite and suggesting a win-win situation, we increase the chances of Alice engaging in further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your response, Bob. Considering your offer, I would like to counter with $75 for the product. This price reflects a compromise between our values and could be beneficial for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still closer to our target price. Let's try one more time to negotiate before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $70? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

We're getting closer to our maximum budget. This counter-offer aims for a price that benefits both parties,  while subtly conveying our willingness to walk away if needed."
