"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget concerns, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $13,000 is still a bit too rich for my blood. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $12,000 is the absolute lowest I can go. I have another buyer interested at that price, but I wanted to give you the chance first.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you have another buyer interested at $12,000, but I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a good deal. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, which is the best I can do. Can you accept that?",11500.0,Bob,6,
