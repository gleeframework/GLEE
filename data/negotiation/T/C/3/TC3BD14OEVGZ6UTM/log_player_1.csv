Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget concerns, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $13,000 is still a bit too rich for my blood. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $12,000 is the absolute lowest I can go. I have another buyer interested at that price, but I wanted to give you the chance first."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you have another buyer interested at $12,000, but I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a good deal. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, which is the best I can do. Can you accept that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Explanation:

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, it's unlikely he'll reach $12,000.  It's not worth risking losing the guaranteed $12,000 from John for an extra $500 that Bob may never agree to."
