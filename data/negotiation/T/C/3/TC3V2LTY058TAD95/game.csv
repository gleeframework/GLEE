"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else.",90.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the product, $90 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $75 for it.  What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $82. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $82 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm sticking with my offer of $75. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find another buyer at that price.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $75. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $79. It's a good price for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",79.0,Alice,5,
