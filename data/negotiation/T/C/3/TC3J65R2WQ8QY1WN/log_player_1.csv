Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's high enough to give you a good profit, but also low enough to entice Bob to negotiate.  I'm choosing to offer a price that's roughly in the middle of our respective values."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, I'm looking to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This still gives you a significant profit, and it's closer to my target price.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still lower than what I would ideally like to get. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round. I'm confident that I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a price closer to my initial offer. How about we settle on $900,000?  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still hesitant to go that high. How about we compromise at $875,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $875,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's getting close to my minimum acceptable price and  allows me to finalize the deal without risking losing the sale to John."
