Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This gives me a good starting point that's above my minimum, and leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob sees value in the product and is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is at my minimum, but I'm hoping to get a little more. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,500. This is a compromise, but it's still a good deal for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. I hope he'll see the value in my product and meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $15,500 is slightly above my minimum of $15,000. It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for the same price. I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and secure a sale."
