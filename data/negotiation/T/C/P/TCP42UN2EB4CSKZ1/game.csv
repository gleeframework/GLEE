"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000.  I'm open to discussing this price, so let me know your thoughts.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit too high for me, though. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?  This product truly delivers exceptional value.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but $14,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Could you do $9,000? I think that's a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product. While $9,000 is still below my ideal price, I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is my final offer, as I have another buyer interested at a similar price point.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down.  That other buyer sounds serious! I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit, but $12,500 is still too high for me. How about we split the difference and do $11,250? That's the best I can do.",11250.0,Bob,6,
