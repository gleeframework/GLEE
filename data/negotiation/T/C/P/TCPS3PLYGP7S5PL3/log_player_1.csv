I'm offering the product to Bob for $13,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000, but still leaves me with a profit. I'm hoping Bob will find this offer attractive and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is more than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $11,000. This is still below my ideal price, but it's closer to what I'm willing to accept. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my product and meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Although Bob has increased his offer to $10,000, it's still not close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. To avoid further negotiation and ensure a better return, I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000."
