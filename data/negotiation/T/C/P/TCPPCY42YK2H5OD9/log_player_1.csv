{""message"": ""Bob, I'm delighted to offer you this product, which I believe will be highly valuable to you. My asking price is $1,150,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000. I believe that's a fair price that allows for a reasonable profit margin. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial asking price. It's still early in the negotiations, and I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.

I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in this round."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. It shows you're willing to negotiate. To be frank, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm still confident that I can get closer to my asking price.  We're getting closer, and I believe we can reach a deal that benefits both of us in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,075,000 isn't quite where I need to be.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,087,500.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I'm hopeful we can finally reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1087500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I appreciate the concessions you've made so far. How about this: I'll agree to $1,080,000, but that's my absolute best offer. It's a fair price, and it allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

This is a good deal for me, considering we're already in round 6. I'm getting closer to my minimum goal of $1,000,000 and Bob seems firm on his offer. Accepting now is the best choice."
