"Bob, I'm delighted to offer you this product, which I believe will be highly valuable to you. My asking price is $1,150,000. This reflects the significant value of the product and allows for a fair margin for you.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000. I believe that's a fair price that allows for a reasonable profit margin. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial price, and I believe it's a fair compromise that still allows you to realize the value of the product. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement in this round.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. It shows you're willing to negotiate. To be frank, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,075,000 isn't quite where I need to be.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,087,500.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I'm hopeful we can finally reach an agreement.",1087500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I appreciate the concessions you've made so far. How about this: I'll agree to $1,080,000, but that's my absolute best offer. It's a fair price, and it allows both of us to walk away happy. What do you say?",1080000.0,Bob,6,
