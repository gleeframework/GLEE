Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** This gives Bob an incentive to counteroffer, allowing me to potentially push the price higher. 
* **John as a Backup:**  I have John as a backup buyer who will pay my minimum price ($12,000), so I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counteroffer at $9,500 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While $9,500 is closer to my minimum than his initial perceived value, it's still below what I'm aiming for.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  I believe I can push Bob further, as he clearly sees the value of the product and is willing to negotiate. 
* **John as Safety Net:** Having John as a backup buyer gives me the confidence to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate your interest. While I value our discussion, $9,500 is still a bit below my target price. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?  This would be a fair compromise and allow us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint Compromise:**  Offering $9,750 presents a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still being closer to my desired price point.
* **Appealing to Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing fairness by calling it a ""fair compromise."" This can appeal to Bob's sense of equity and encourage him to accept. 
* **Maintaining Flexibility:**  While this is closer to my minimum, it still leaves room for potential further negotiation if Bob wants to counter again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to consider $9,700 as a counteroffer. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while remaining within my budget. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $9,700 is very close to my desired price point of $9,750. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  While I could potentially push for another $50, there's a risk that Bob will walk away. Accepting his offer ensures a sale close to my target price. 
* **Time and Effort:** Continuing the negotiation might take more time and effort, and it's not guaranteed that I'll get a significantly better price.
* **John's Offer:**  While John is willing to pay $12,000, the time and effort to secure a sale with John might be more significant than accepting Bob's offer, which is already a good deal for me."
