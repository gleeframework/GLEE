Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at a special price of $11,000. This is a one-time offer, so let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but she also needs to offer Bob a price that's enticing.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $8,000, so Alice needs to offer it at a price significantly lower than his valuation to make it attractive.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Offering it at $11,000 gives Bob a potential ""deal"" of $3,000 and nets Alice a profit of $1,000 over her guaranteed sale to John. 

This strategy aims to balance maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
