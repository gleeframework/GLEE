Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to capture most of the value while still leaving room for negotiation.  $1,400,000 is a significant amount for Bob, but it still leaves him with a $100,000 profit. This should encourage him to consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's better than selling to John, it's still significantly less than what I want for the product. I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm countering with $1,300,000. This is still a good profit for Bob ($200,000) while also allowing me to make a considerable profit.  This should be a reasonable compromise."
