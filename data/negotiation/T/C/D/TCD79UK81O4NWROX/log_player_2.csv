"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great starting point for our conversation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still too high for Bob. He has a maximum budget of $1,200,000 and wants to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $925,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $925,000 is still above Bob's desired price point. He is looking to save as much money as possible and wants to continue negotiating to try and reach a lower price. Rejecting this offer allows him to make another counteroffer."

Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $912,500 is closer to Bob's desired price range, it's still above his target.  He wants to save as much as possible and believes he can still negotiate a lower price.  He'll reject this offer and continue negotiating."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll counteroffer at $907,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close:**  At $907,500, Alice's offer is only $7,500 away from Bob's last counteroffer of $900,000.  
* **Risk of buying from John:**  If Bob rejects this offer, he risks having to buy from John for $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Alice's current offer.
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  While Bob might be able to negotiate a lower price, there's no guarantee Alice will budge further.  

**Conclusion:** Given the risk of a higher price from John and the relatively small difference in price, Bob should accept Alice's offer."
