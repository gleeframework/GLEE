"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110.",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $90?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer $100. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's see if we can close the deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $95 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $98. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I'm getting close to my minimum price.",98.0,Alice,5,
