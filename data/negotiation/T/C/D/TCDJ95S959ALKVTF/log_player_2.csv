"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is less than John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by counteroffering. There's room for negotiation as Alice values the product at $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can see you're willing to pay $13,000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though - I can do $14,200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While Alice is willing to come down a bit, $14,200 is still higher than what Bob is comfortable with.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if Alice can come down further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,200 is still a little high for me. I'm really keen on this product, but my budget maxes out at $13,500.  Let's meet in the middle at that price and seal the deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm not willing to go as low as $13,500, but I can meet you halfway between $14,200 and $13,500. I'll do $13,800. That's the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:**  $13,800 is less than Bob's maximum of $15,000.
* **The price is close to Bob's desired price:** Bob's counteroffer was $13,500, so $13,800 is a small difference.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to get a significantly better price:** Alice has already demonstrated a willingness to negotiate, but it's unlikely she'll go much lower.  There's a risk that rejecting the offer will lead to a stalemate or Alice going back to her initial price.

By accepting the offer, Bob saves $1,200 compared to buying from John."
