"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can save a significant amount of money by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer.  $800,000 is still a substantial amount, and Bob has room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This aggressive approach sets the stage for a negotiation where both parties have room to compromise.  It's unlikely Alice will accept this offer outright, but it will force her to reconsider her position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, there's still room for further negotiation.  Bob should continue to try and reduce the price.  Accepting $750,000 would be a good deal, but Bob can likely do better if he continues to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a smaller jump this time, showing a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price.  This is a good strategy to show Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but wants a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $725,000, which is only $25,000 away from Bob's last counteroffer.  While there's still a chance to negotiate further, it's becoming risky.  If Bob rejects this offer, there's no guarantee Alice will come down further.  Also, with only 5 rounds remaining, the risk of running out of time and having to buy from John for $1,000,000 is increasing. Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product for a decent price while still saving a substantial amount of money."
