"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on this product. However, given my current budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $2000000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1500000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $1500000 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to be flexible.  To show my commitment to this deal, I'll lower my price to $1750000. This still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential value of this product to your business.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
