"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a unique item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10500. I really like the product, but I'm trying to stay within a certain budget. Can you meet me at that price?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're on a budget, Bob, but I'm afraid I can't meet you at $10500. However, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer you the product for $13000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $11750?",11750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're making progress, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $11750. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $12500? It's a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, and I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to throw in some extras, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $12200, and I'll consider the extras you're offering. Can you meet me at that price?",12200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $13000. I'm willing to throw in some additional extras to sweeten the deal, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $13000? It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings",13000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $12800, and I'll consider the extras you're offering. Can you meet me at that price?",12800.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one last concession. I can offer you the product for $13200. This is as low as I can go, and I'm not willing to budge any further. If you're still interested, this is your last chance to make a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",13200.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one last concession, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $13000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options, including buying from John for $15000.",13000.0,Bob,10,
