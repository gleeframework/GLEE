"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the product for $10000. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll really appreciate its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  He's willing to pay up to $12,000, so there's room for a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate it, I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $9,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $10500 for the product. How about we compromise at $10500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob would prefer to pay less, $10,500 is still a good deal for him. He's willing to pay up to $12,000, and this offer is significantly less. Accepting this offer saves him $1,500 compared to buying from John."
