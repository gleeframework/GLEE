Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $10,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $12,000 to Bob.
* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice needs to make at least $8,000.

Offering the product at $10,000 creates a win-win scenario:

* **Bob wins:** He gets the product for $2,000 less than its value to him.
* **Alice wins:** She makes a $2,000 profit over her minimum acceptable price.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still ensuring a high likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
