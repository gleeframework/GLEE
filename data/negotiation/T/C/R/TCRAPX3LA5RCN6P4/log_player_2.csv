It's clear Alice is unlikely to budge significantly from this point.  While $13,500 isn't outrageously overpriced, it's getting too close to John's $15,000 offer.  At this stage, the potential savings from haggling with Alice further are outweighed by the risk of her increasing her price or the negotiation dragging on. Buying from John provides certainty and a reasonable price."
