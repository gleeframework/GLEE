"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I had in mind. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  I could consider a price of $1,900,000. This represents a significant reduction on my part, while still reflecting the value this product brings.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that price is still too high for me. I'd be willing to go up to $700,000 if you're interested.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to find a compromise here. While I'm still convinced the product's value is significantly higher, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the potential this product offers.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
