"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the deal, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10000. I'm willing to consider a price of $11500. It's a compromise, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11500 is still a bit high for me. I'm feeling $11000 is a fair price that we can both agree on. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going all the way down to $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we try $12250? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I think it's still a fair compromise.",12250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate the effort to compromise, but I'm still aiming for something closer to $11000.  Could we meet at $11500?  That seems like a fair compromise for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're close to your target, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going all the way up to $11500. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $12750? It's my final offer, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",12750.0,Alice,7,
