"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the deal, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10000. I'm willing to consider a price of $11500. It's a compromise, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is closer to his target, it's still above his preferred price point. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm feeling $11,000 is a fair price that we can both agree on. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going all the way down to $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we try $12250? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I think it's still a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $10,000.  While Alice's offer is a step down, it's still outside of Bob's comfort zone.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and gives Bob the opportunity to try and push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the effort to compromise, but I'm still aiming for something closer to $11,000.  Could we meet at $11,500?  That seems like a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're close to your target, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going all the way up to $11500. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $12750? It's my final offer, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $12,750 is still too high for Bob.  He has already made several counteroffers and Alice has not budged significantly.  It is unlikely that Alice will lower her price any further, and Bob is starting to run out of time. Buying from John for $15,000 guarantees Bob the product within his budget, even if it's not the ideal price."
