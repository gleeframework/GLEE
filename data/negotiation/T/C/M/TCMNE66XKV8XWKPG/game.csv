"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable, but not at that cost.  I'd be willing to consider something closer to $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your initial offer reflects. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product has value, but we're still pretty far apart. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000, but that's as high as I can go right now.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a deal.  Let's bridge this gap - I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product and represents a fair offer.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're making progress, but that's still quite a leap from my last offer. To be frank, I'm getting close to going with my alternative option. If you're willing to come down to $1,100,000, we have a deal. Otherwise, I think it's best I explore other options.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and I'm motivated to close this deal. My final offer is $1,300,000. This is a significant reduction on my part and a fair price considering the product's value. I believe this is a win-win situation for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
