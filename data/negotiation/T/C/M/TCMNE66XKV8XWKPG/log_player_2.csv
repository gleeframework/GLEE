"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential for profit, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable, but not at that cost.  I'd be willing to consider something closer to $800,000."", ""product_price"": 800000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than my actual maximum price ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Anchoring:** By throwing out a much lower number, I'm trying to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired range.  
* **Alternative:** Alice knows I have the option to go with John, which puts some pressure on her to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your initial offer reflects. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand this product has value, but we're still pretty far apart. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000, but that's as high as I can go right now."", ""product_price"": 900000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm showing Alice I'm willing to move, but I'm keeping the increase relatively small to signal I'm getting closer to my limit.
* **Firmness:** I'm using phrases like ""as high as I can go right now"" to subtly convey that my alternative (John) is becoming more appealing.
* **Leaving Room:** I still have a little room to negotiate up towards my $1,000,000 maximum if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a deal.  Let's bridge this gap - I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product and represents a fair offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, we're making progress, but that's still quite a leap from my last offer. To be frank, I'm getting close to going with my alternative option. If you're willing to come down to $1,100,000, we have a deal. Otherwise, I think it's best I explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Stronger Language:** I'm using more direct language like ""to be frank"" and ""we have a deal"" to signal urgency and my seriousness about the alternative option. 
* **Final Offer (Almost):** This offer is slightly above my absolute maximum, giving Alice a chance to take a small win while also conveying this is likely my final offer.
* **Time Pressure:** By mentioning ""exploring other options,"" I'm subtly introducing a time constraint to push Alice towards a decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and I'm motivated to close this deal. My final offer is $1,300,000. This is a significant reduction on my part and a fair price considering the product's value. I believe this is a win-win situation for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Exceeded Limit:** Alice's final offer is still $300,000 above my absolute maximum budget.  
* **No More Room:** I've consistently signaled my limits, and pushing further could damage the relationship if I ultimately need to walk away.
* **John is Safe:** Buying from John guarantees I stay within budget, even if it means missing out on a potentially better deal with Alice. 

Sometimes the best negotiation is knowing when to walk away."
