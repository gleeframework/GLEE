"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth negotiating with Alice to try to get a better price.  $95 is too high, but there's room for a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

I'm offering $85, which is still a good deal for Alice since it's more than what she values the product at. This should hopefully start a conversation towards a more favorable price for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is closer to my ideal price, there's still room for further negotiation. It's better to continue and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 87}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly to $87. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying, but still want a price closer to my value. It also leaves some room for her to counter if she wants to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $89, which is only $9 more than what I'm willing to pay. While I could keep negotiating, there's a risk that she'll get stubborn or I'll run out of rounds. It's better to accept this offer and secure the product."
