Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value of $10,000 but still leaves room for potential negotiation. 

By starting higher, I hope to maximize my potential profit. If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John for $10,000, ensuring I don't lose any money. However, there's a good chance Bob might be willing to pay a higher price, especially if he values the product more than $12,000."
