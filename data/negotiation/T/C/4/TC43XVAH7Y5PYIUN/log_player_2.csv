"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase a product that holds immense value. While I can't disclose the specifics just yet, I assure you it's worth at least $1000000 to me. I'm starting with an offer of $1500000. This is a significant investment, but I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's potential.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above your budget. It's best to reject and start negotiating.  You have a clear upper limit of $800,000 and plenty of rounds to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to consider purchasing the product, but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time. This is my maximum budget. I'm eager to learn more about the product, but this price is my absolute limit. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your financial constraints.  While $800000 is a significant amount, it doesn't reflect the true value of this product for me. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1200000. This price is still below its true worth but shows my willingness to compromise. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your budget, though she is showing a willingness to negotiate.  You should continue to try and negotiate down to your desired price. There's still time to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  I'm ready to make a final offer of $900,000. This reflects the value I see in the product and the potential for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let's work towards an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective and the limitations of your budget.  I'm willing to make one final compromise to see if we can reach a deal.  I'm offering the product for $1000000. This is my absolute minimum, as it reflects the product's true value to me.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than previous rounds, it's still above your budget. You have a few more rounds to try and negotiate, and there's still a possibility she will go lower. It's best to try to get the price closer to your maximum offer of $800,000."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your efforts to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still outside my budget. To finalize this deal, I'm willing to offer $950,000, which is my absolute final offer. If you're open to it, we can finalize the transaction.  However, if this isn't acceptable, I'll need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 950000}
