{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to get as much as possible.  I'll be prepared to negotiate down if necessary, but I want to see if I can get a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd prefer to sell it to him, it's not worth selling for less than $150. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still aiming for a profit.  This is a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer."
