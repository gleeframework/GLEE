"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it has immense potential and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  Given the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $1,000,000. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value and allows us both to walk away with a good deal. What do you say?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $1,050,000. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $1,080,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth and shows my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
