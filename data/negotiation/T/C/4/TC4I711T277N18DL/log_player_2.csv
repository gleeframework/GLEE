"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it has immense potential and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth, and I'm open to negotiating further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to her. There's room for negotiation, and it's likely we can get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows us to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  Given the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $1,000,000. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to our initial counteroffer, we can still potentially get a better price.  $1,100,000 is still too high, considering the product's worth to Alice is $1,500,000. Rejecting the offer allows us to continue negotiating and potentially reach a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value and allows us both to walk away with a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $1,050,000. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $1,080,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth and shows my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial asking price, and we're getting close to our initial counteroffer of $1,000,000. Accepting this offer saves us $420,000 compared to buying from John. While we could potentially negotiate a lower price, the risk of losing the deal entirely and having to buy from John for a higher price is not worth the potential savings."
