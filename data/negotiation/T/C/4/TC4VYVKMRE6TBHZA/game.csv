"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit to $10,750. Let's meet in the middle, and we can finalize this deal.",10750.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $10,750. Can we try $10,125?",10125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about we settle on $10,500? This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal.",10500.0,Alice,5,
