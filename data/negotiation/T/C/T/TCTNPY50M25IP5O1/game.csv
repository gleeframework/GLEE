"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true value. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the opportunity to purchase this product. I understand its value, but I believe I can't justify spending $1,200,000 on it. Could we perhaps negotiate a price closer to my budget, around $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While $1,200,000 represents its premium value, I'm willing to move closer to your number. How about we settle at $1,000,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my position. I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price. However, I still feel that $1,000,000 is slightly above my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate further towards $900,000? I believe this could be a mutually beneficial solution.",900000.0,Bob,4,
