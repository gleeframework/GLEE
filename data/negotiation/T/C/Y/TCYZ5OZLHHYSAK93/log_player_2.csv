"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell this high-value product to you at a competitive price. I'm thinking of starting with $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a decent price, it's still more than Bob wants to pay.  He has 10 rounds to negotiate and can always buy from John as a backup. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of counteroffering at $11,500. This is the best I can do, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best deal possible. While $11,500 is closer to his target than Alice's initial offer, it's still above his desired price point.  There are still rounds left for negotiation, and Bob can always purchase from John for $15,000 if necessary.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,250 is now within Bob's acceptable range and represents a significant discount from her initial price.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice could refuse further offers, and Bob would be forced to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price and avoids the risk of a higher price later."
