It's always beneficial to try to negotiate a lower price, especially when you have a backup option.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to get a better price."

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's well below Alice's initial offer. This sets the stage for negotiation and hopefully leads to a more favorable deal."

Alice has moved closer to my price, but there's still room for negotiation. I'll try another counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing a willingness to compromise while still staying below Alice's current offer.  This could encourage Alice to make a further concession."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

```

While I'd like to keep negotiating, Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price point.  It's better to secure the product at $825,000 than risk further negotiation and potentially end up buying from John for $1,500,000."
