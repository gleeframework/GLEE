"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, $1,350,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Bob,4,
