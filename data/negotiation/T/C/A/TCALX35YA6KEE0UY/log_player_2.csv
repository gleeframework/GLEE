"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high. It makes sense to negotiate for a lower price.  We have plenty of rounds to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're aiming to pay significantly less than Alice's initial offer and our maximum budget.  Starting with a lower offer gives us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Interested:** We want to maintain a positive tone to encourage Alice to continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit high for you, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you. However, I'm still open to negotiations if you're willing to pay more. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** Alice is now offering the product at her own valuation. This means we're very likely to get the best possible price. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  While we have more rounds to negotiate, there's no guarantee Alice will go any lower. Accepting now secures a good price.
* **John's Price:** Buying from John would cost us $2,000 more."
