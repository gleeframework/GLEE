"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value, I'm starting the price at $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, considering what a valuable asset it is. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

The product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, and she's offering it for $1,100,000. This means she's still willing to make a profit, and there's likely room for negotiation. It's better to reject the offer and try to get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget concerns. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a compromise here, but I need you to understand this product's value.  My final offer is $1,000,000.  This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's more than fair.

Alice's final offer of $1,000,000 is still above my budget, even though it's a significant drop from her initial price.  I've already made several counteroffers, and it seems like we're not going to reach an agreement. It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $800,000."
