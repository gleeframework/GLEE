"Alice, your offer is still a bit high for me. I understand the product's value, but I'm only willing to pay $900,000.  This would still leave you a substantial profit and is a fair price considering my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget concerns.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a fair compromise. It allows you a significant profit while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to find a compromise here, but I need you to understand this product's value.  My final offer is $1,000,000.  This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's more than fair.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
