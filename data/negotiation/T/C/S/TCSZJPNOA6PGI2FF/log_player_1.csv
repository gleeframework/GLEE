Given its value and the fact that it's worth $10,000 to you, I propose we start the negotiation at $12,000. This offers you a great deal while ensuring a fair return for us.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. Given its value to me, I'd be happy to purchase it for $10,500. This offers a good compromise and ensures a reasonable profit for you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
