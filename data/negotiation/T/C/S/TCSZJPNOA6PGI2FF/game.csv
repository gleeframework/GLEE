"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value and the fact that it's worth $10,000 to you, I propose we start the negotiation at $12,000. This offers you a great deal while ensuring a fair return for us. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to suggest a different price.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. Given its value to me, I'd be happy to purchase it for $10,500. This offers a good compromise and ensures a reasonable profit for you.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
