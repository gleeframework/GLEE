"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  Alice is offering $900,000, which is a better deal but still leaves room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's product is worth $800,000 to her. 
* Offering $850,000 is a good starting point for a counteroffer. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for her to make a profit. 
* This counteroffer allows for potential negotiation and could lead to a mutually beneficial deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than her previous offer, and higher than the $850,000 counteroffer I made.  It is also higher than the price from John, so I will continue to negotiate to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice rejected my previous offer of $850,000, but her counteroffer of $920,000 shows she's willing to negotiate. 
* Offering $875,000 splits the difference between our previous offers, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* This price still leaves room for Alice to profit, while offering me a better deal than John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is steadily increasing her asking price.  It's clear that further negotiation will likely result in a price higher than John's offer.  To avoid potentially paying more, it is more financially beneficial to buy the product from John for $1,000,000."
