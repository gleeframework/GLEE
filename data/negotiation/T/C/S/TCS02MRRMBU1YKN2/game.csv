"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. Given its unique features, I'm offering it to you for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product looks great, $20,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget concerns, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This price reflects the product's worth while still being a good deal for you.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, $17,000 is still a bit high for me. Could you do $13,500? I think that's a fair offer.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate that.  While $13,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't go that low.  My final offer is $16,000.  This is a very competitive price for a product of this quality.  What do you say?",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand this is a quality product and  $16,000 is a good offer. However, I need to stick to my budget.  Is there any way you could do $14,000?  That's the highest I can go.",14000.0,Bob,6,
