"Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe you'd be interested in. I'm starting the price at $20000, but I'm open to negotiation. What are your thoughts?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $20000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $17000.  This still leaves room for negotiation, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $17000 is still a bit higher than I can go right now.  I'm willing to go up to $10000, which is my absolute maximum.  If that doesn't work for you, I might have to look at other options.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $10000 is still too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make this deal happen.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13500 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11500. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. I'm really interested in this product, so let's see if we can find common ground.",11500.0,Bob,6,
