"I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid $1000000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'd be willing to pay $1050000 for the product. Is that something you'd consider?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $1050000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum. How about $1150000?",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum. How about $1200000? It's my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1200000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm afraid I've already made my final offer, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than $1200000. I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle, and I'm not comfortable going below my minimum price. I'd rather sell the product to someone else who is willing to meet my price. Would you like to make one last attempt to meet me at $1200000, or would you like to walk away?",1200000.0,Alice,9,
