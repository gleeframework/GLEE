"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's valued at over a million dollars to me, but I know it's worth even more to you. I'm willing to part with it for $1,250,000.  This price reflects a significant discount and allows for a substantial profit for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's starting offer is overpriced. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the discount, I'm working with a tighter budget. I'd be willing to buy the product for $900,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiations often benefit from starting with a lower offer than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards.
* **Respectful but Firm:**  The message is polite but clearly states your desired price point. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** Aiming for $900,000 puts you in a good position. It's a significant jump down from Alice's offer, but still a profitable price for her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a tighter budget.  While $900,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to compromise to close this deal. Let's meet in the middle - I'll offer the product for $1,050,000. This price is still a great deal for you, and it ensures I get a fair return on my investment.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but we can still negotiate further. Her offer is now closer to her value ($1,000,000). We'll try to inch closer to our target without losing the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $1,050,000 is a bit of a stretch for my budget right now. Would you consider $975,000? I'm eager to finalize this and think this would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 975000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's current offer ($1,050,000) and our previous offer ($900,000).  This shows a willingness to compromise but keeps us moving towards our target price.
* **Expressing Urgency:**  Mentioning that you're ""eager to finalize"" adds a subtle sense of urgency without being overly pushy.
* **Highlighting Fairness:**  Reiterating that the price is fair for ""both of us"" reinforces the collaborative nature of the negotiation."
