Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $18,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his level of interest and his perceived value of the product. 
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John, so there's limited risk in starting with a higher offer to Bob.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. You can gradually lower the price, but ensure you don't go below your $12,000 minimum."
