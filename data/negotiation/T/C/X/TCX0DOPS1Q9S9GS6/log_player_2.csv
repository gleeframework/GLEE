"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I believe it's worth $12,000 to you. I'm willing to let it go for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  I'll try a counteroffer to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it leaves room for further negotiation. It also signals that I'm serious about buying but looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice met me in the middle, and $10,000 is a fair price that saves me $2,000 compared to John's offer. There's no guarantee I could get a better deal from Alice, and I risk pushing her away.  It's time to accept and get the product."
