Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate and encourages Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$120 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still potentially attractive to Bob since it's higher than his offer. This should encourage further negotiation without risking losing the deal completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $130 is still below my preferred price, it's closer to my minimum acceptable price and risks of further negotiation are high.  I'll accept Bob's offer to secure the sale and avoid the potential of losing the deal entirely."
