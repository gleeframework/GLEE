{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum acceptable price:** This ensures you make a profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.

By starting with a moderate price, you can gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is still above your minimum, it's a significantly lower profit margin.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to try and get closer to your desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $100 is a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $110? This price still leaves room for you to save and ensures I can cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 110}
