# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.

Bob should reject the offer.  He can get the product for less from John. While there's a chance Alice might come down in price, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $950,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Bob should buy from John. While Alice has come down in price, it's still above his target.  John offers the product at his desired price, so there's no need to risk further negotiation with Alice."
