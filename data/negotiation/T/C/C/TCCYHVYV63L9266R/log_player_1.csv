"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $1,100,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. This product offers exceptional value, and I believe a price closer to my original offer is more reflective of that. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,000,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your previous offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly moving towards my price point, but I'm not in a hurry.  I'm willing to see if he'll go a bit higher before I consider accepting. I'm confident I can get a better deal than $950,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To demonstrate my own flexibility, I'm willing to come down slightly. How about $975,000? This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's value while still working within your budget."", 
""product_price"": 975000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $975,000, so I'll make a counteroffer of $962,500. I think this is a fair price that recognizes the product's value without breaking the bank. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $962,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $962,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is definitely getting closer to a more acceptable price, I'm still leaving a significant amount of money on the table if I accept. There's still room to negotiate, and I'm willing to push a bit further, especially since I have John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  How about we split the difference one last time? Let's say $968,750, and we have a deal."", 
""product_price"": 968750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm applying a bit more pressure here. By suggesting this is the ""last time"" I'm willing to split the difference, I'm hoping to incentivize Bob to accept. This offer is still a good deal for me, and it avoids the risk of further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to pay $968,750. I'm willing to meet you at $955,000, which is as high as I'm willing to go. I hope we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $955,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $955,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to move significantly from his $955,000 offer. While I could continue negotiating, it's becoming increasingly risky. I'm better off taking the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John rather than potentially losing even more ground with Bob or ending up with no deal at all."
