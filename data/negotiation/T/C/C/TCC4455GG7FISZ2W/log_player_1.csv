Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  I know the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, so this gives me some room to negotiate.  If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and see if it's worth continuing the negotiation or if it's better to go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I still believe I can get a better deal. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000} 
```

I'm willing to come down slightly from my initial offer, but I still believe the product is worth more than $1,800,000. This counteroffer shows I'm open to negotiation, while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close enough to my minimum acceptable price.  At this point, I'm happy to close the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation.  It's not as much as I hoped for initially, but it's still a good profit for me."
