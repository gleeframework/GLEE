"Alice, your offer is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $800000. If you're willing to consider that price, I'm ready to make a deal.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1400000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $1400000 is still too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my maximum budget is $800000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $1400000 is still a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1200000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
