Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1400000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1400000 is still a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1200000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value.
