Round 5

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to be fair.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but $8,750 is my final offer. It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.

You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly committed to a slow descent in price, and we're running out of rounds.  While we could likely push for a slightly lower price, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at $10,000 is too great.  $8,750 is a good price, and it's time to accept."
