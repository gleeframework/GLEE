"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'd be interested in. My initial offer is $11,000.  Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you showing interest but $7,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but I'm on a tight budget. How about $8,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer and shows I'm serious about buying.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate, which I appreciate. $8,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer!  How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $8,500? It seems like a fair compromise to me.",8500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to be fair.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but $8,750 is my final offer. It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",8750.0,Alice,7,
