Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** Alice will get $1,500,000 from John, so she won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. This is the maximum he's willing to pay.
* **Negotiation Room:** There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Optimal Strategy**

Alice should aim for the highest price Bob is likely to accept.  Here's how:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Considering its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,199,999. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1199999}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below Bob's maximum valuation ($1,199,999) creates a strong incentive for him to accept. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" adds a time pressure element, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the product's worth, the message implies a high value by using phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value.""

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation.  If Bob rejects this offer, Alice will sell to John at her guaranteed price."
