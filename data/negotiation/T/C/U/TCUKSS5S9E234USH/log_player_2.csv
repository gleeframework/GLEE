"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for a price of $18,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that I'm confident you'll love. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and what John offers.  You should definitely counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $18,000 is way beyond my budget. I'm interested, but only if it's within a more reasonable range.  Would you consider $6,000?"", ""product_price"": 6000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This offer is substantially lower than Alice's asking price. While it might seem aggressive, it establishes your budget limitations and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Anchoring:** By starting low, you aim to ""anchor"" the negotiation around a lower number. This can influence Alice's counteroffer to be more favorable than if you had started higher.
* **Leaving Room:**  There's a significant gap between your offer and your $8,000 walk-away point. This allows you to negotiate upward in subsequent rounds while still potentially securing a great deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but $6,000 is a bit low for my expectations. Let me see if I can meet you in the middle. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $12,000. It's a fair price that I think reflects the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice is moving in the right direction, $12,000 is still above both your target price and what John offers. There's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  However, $12,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be open to $8,000?"", ""product_price"": 8000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Your Limit:** This offer represents the absolute maximum you're willing to pay.
* **Signaling Seriousness:** By offering your max, you're signaling to Alice that you're serious but also unwilling to budge further. 
* **Pressure on Alice:** This puts the ball in Alice's court. She now knows your limit and has to decide if it's worth selling to you or holding out for a potentially better offer elsewhere."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to make a deal, Bob. However, $8,000 is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Alice has made it clear that $10,000 is her absolute lowest price.
* **Better Alternative:**  John is offering the product for $8,000, which is your maximum budget.
* **No Point in Further Negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate with Alice is unlikely to result in a better price. You've reached an impasse. 

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and secure the product from John at your target price."
