"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the potential return on investment you'll gain.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, the price you've offered is a bit steep for me. Given the market value and my budget, I'm willing to offer $1,700,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I believe the value of this product is significantly higher than what you're proposing. It's a unique opportunity with the potential for substantial returns. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. This still reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I still believe $2,100,000 is too high.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to offer $1,900,000 for the product. This represents a significant compromise on my end and would allow us to both walk away with a positive outcome.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
