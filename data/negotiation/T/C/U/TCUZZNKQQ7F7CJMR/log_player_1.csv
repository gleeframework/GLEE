Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it has the potential to be highly valuable to your operations.  While my asking price is $1,400,000,  I'm open to discussing a figure that makes sense for both of us. How does that sound?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,400,000 vs. $800,000) sets a strong anchor. This might make a lower counter-offer from Bob more favorable. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The message explicitly states willingness to negotiate, giving Bob an opening to counter-offer. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, ensuring you meet your minimum.

This strategy aims to maximize profit by:

1. **Potentially securing a price higher than Bob's perceived value.**
2. **Falling back on a guaranteed sale at your minimum acceptable price.**"
