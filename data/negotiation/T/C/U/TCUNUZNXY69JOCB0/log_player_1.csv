Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,450,000. This is a one-time offer before I move forward with other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a price slightly below your guaranteed sale price to John ($1,500,000) sets a high anchor. This makes Bob perceive the final offer as more reasonable, even if it's significantly higher than his perceived value.
* **Exclusivity and Scarcity:** Emphasizing that this is a limited-time offer before you move on to other buyers creates a sense of urgency and scarcity.
* **Justification of Value:**  While not explicitly stating Bob's perceived value, the message hints at the product's worth being higher than what he might think by mentioning ""significant value"" and ""your insights.""

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:** If Bob accepts, you gain a significant profit above his perceived value.
2. **Secure a Sale:** The offer is appealing enough to potentially sway Bob, but you still have the safety net of John's offer."
