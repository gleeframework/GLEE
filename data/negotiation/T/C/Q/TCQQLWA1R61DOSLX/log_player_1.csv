"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I know it's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.  I'm confident that the product is worth more than $10,000 to me, so I'm aiming to get a good profit.  We'll see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can't pay more than $9,000 for the product. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is tempting, I'm confident I can get more. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with my own.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for significantly less than my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $10,500. It's a fair price considering the value of this product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm trying to be reasonable while still protecting my profit margin. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enticing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm still not able to pay more than $9,500 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. While $9,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still a bit below what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to go down to $10,000, but I'm not going any lower.  This product is worth a lot, and I think $10,000 is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

This is my final offer. I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can finally close the deal. If he rejects it, I'll sell the product to John."
