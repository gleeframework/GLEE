"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a little high for my budget. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product's quality and features. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
