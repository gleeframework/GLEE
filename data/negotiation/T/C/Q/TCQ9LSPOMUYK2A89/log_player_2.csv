"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $100, but Alice's offer is $90, leaving you some room for negotiation. 
* Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer of $85. This is halfway between Alice's offer of $90 and my maximum price of $100. 
* It shows I'm serious about buying the product but also willing to negotiate. 
* This gives Alice some room to counter, but also leaves me some wiggle room if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is higher than my initial counteroffer, but still less than my maximum price. 
* There's still room for negotiation, and I'm not in a rush to buy from John at a higher price. 
* Rejecting allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 88} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm raising my offer slightly to $88. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and compromise, while still keeping the price below my target of $90. 
* This offer is closer to Alice's last offer of $92, showing a willingness to meet halfway, but not too far from my previous offer. 
* This allows for further negotiation, but also puts pressure on Alice to accept before I consider John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $95 is getting closer to my maximum price of $100. 
* However, it's still higher than my ideal price and indicates Alice is not willing to come down much further. 
*  Since there are limited rounds left, and I don't want to risk further negotiation and getting stuck with a higher price, I'm better off securing the product from John for $100. This ensures I get the product at my maximum price."
