"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can do better than $1,100,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still within a range where she might be willing to negotiate. We'll see how she responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still not as low as you'd like.  It's worth trying to negotiate further. You can likely get a better price than $1,080,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1020000}
```

This counteroffer pushes the negotiation closer to your desired price point. You're still willing to pay more than John's price, but you're showing Alice that you're serious about negotiating a fair deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, Alice has come down a bit, and you're only $60,000 away from John's price. It's likely that you won't be able to get a lower price from Alice without further negotiation. It's more efficient to accept the offer and get the product, saving time and effort compared to further negotiation."
