"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm confident we can work out a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I still have room to negotiate and potentially earn more. I'm not yet willing to settle for $1,600,000, especially with 8 rounds left.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue the negotiation and see if I can secure a higher price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While I value our potential partnership, I can't accept $1,600,000 at this time.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000.  This price reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 1650000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,550,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a higher price. I have 6 rounds left, and I believe there's still room to negotiate.  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,550,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's close this deal and make this mutually beneficial. I'm ready to finalize the agreement if you're on board."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,575,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product and the negotiations we've had so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,575,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,575,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are at round 6, leaving only 4 rounds left.  Bob's offer of $1,575,000 is getting close to my minimum and I'm concerned about the risk of going lower and potentially ending up with John's offer of $1,500,000.  Accepting this offer secures a sale and a profit,  which is my main goal."
