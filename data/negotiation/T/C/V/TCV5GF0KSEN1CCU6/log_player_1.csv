Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's value. This allows for some negotiation room, but it's a strong starting point. I'll adjust based on his counteroffer and assess the value of continuing negotiations with him compared to selling to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum value of $12,000.  While it's tempting to take $11,500, I'm going to reject it and see if I can get a better deal from Bob. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12250}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,250. This is a bit closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum price. I'm hoping this will be enough to get Bob to come up a bit more while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $12,000.  While it's getting closer, the risk of further negotiation is not worth it. I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000, as it's a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price."
