"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $11,000? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm still a bit above $10,000, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we aim for $11,500? It's a small step up from your last offer, but I think it's still a great opportunity for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay above my minimum price. How about we aim for $11,000?
