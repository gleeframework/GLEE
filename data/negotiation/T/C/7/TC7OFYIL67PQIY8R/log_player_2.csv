"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable item for a price of $14,000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $14,000 isn't a terrible price, you know you have a fallback option with John at $15,000. There's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower to avoid losing the sale."
