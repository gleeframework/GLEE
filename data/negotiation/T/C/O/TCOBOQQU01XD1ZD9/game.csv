"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $105? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. ",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $95. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but I need to stay within my budget.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $100? This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's try to close this deal.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to pay $97.50 for the product. Can you consider this price?",97.5,Bob,6,
