{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal for something worth at least $100 to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also trying to build a rapport with Bob by being friendly and highlighting the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm confident that I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your offer, I'm still looking for a price closer to $100.  How about we split the difference and go with $95?  That's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $95. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer. It's getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm not willing to settle for less than $100 just yet. I'm confident that I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. How about we meet in the middle again at $93.75? I believe that's a fair compromise, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 93.75} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to walking away, but I still think we can find a mutually beneficial price. How about we go down to $91? That's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100, and we're already halfway through the negotiation rounds. I'm not sure I can get him to agree to a higher price, and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to sell to John for $100."
