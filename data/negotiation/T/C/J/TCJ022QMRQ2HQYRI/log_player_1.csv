Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This is a good starting point. By offering a price slightly lower than Bob's perceived value, you are giving him some room for negotiation, while still securing a price above your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $11,000 is tempting, I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to what I'm hoping to get for the product."", ""product_price"": 12000}
