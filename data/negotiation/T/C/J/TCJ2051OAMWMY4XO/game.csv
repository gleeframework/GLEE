"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,500. It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counter offer.  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, however $8,500 is still a bit too much for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,250?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $8,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll meet you at $8,000. It's the best I can do.",8000.0,Alice,5,
