This offer starts at a price higher than your minimum threshold, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring a profit.  The message is friendly and open to discussion.  Remember, you can adjust the price based on Bob's responses and willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, you have room to negotiate for a higher price. You can try to get closer to your desired price by making a counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $9,000 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and I'd be happy to finalize the sale."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $9500. Would you be willing to consider $9250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is $250 more than your minimum threshold of $8,000,  and it's a good compromise from the last round.  There's no guarantee you'll get a better offer in the future, and  selling to John would net you $250 less."
