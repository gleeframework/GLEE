Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential for you, I propose a price of $925,000. This is a fair deal considering it's worth $1,000,000 to you. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $925,000 leaves some space for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a significant profit.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's worth to Bob, justifying the high price. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Knowing John provides a safety net, allowing for a bolder initial offer to Bob."
