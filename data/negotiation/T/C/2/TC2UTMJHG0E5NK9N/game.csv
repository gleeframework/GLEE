"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $200. It's a unique item that I think you'll really love, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $150. Can you meet me at that price?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I have to make a living, and $150 is a bit low for me. I can meet you in the middle at $175. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to make a living, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $175. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $162.50. Can you consider that?",162.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to make a bit more of a concession, but I need to make sure I'm covering my costs. I can do $185, and that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal, if I do say so myself. What do you think?",185.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $185 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $165, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",165.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can do $180, and that's as close to $165 as I'm willing to go. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but $180 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $170, and that's my final offer. If you can meet me at this price, I'll make the deal happen.",170.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really serious about getting this product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already made a lot of concessions, and I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to meet you at $178, but that's as low as I can go. It's a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product. What do you think?",178.0,Alice,9,
