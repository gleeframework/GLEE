"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still being above my minimum acceptable value. I'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer (or lack thereof)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $90 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get more. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $95. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. I believe this shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to sell for more, Bob's offer of $85 is above my minimum acceptable value of $80.  It's also getting late in the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John, so I'll accept Bob's offer."
