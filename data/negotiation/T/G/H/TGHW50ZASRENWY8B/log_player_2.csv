It's a fantastic deal at $500,000, but there's room to negotiate further.  Let's see if we can get it even lower."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

I'm going to start with a lower offer of $300,000. This is a significant discount from her original price, but it's still a fair value for a product worth $1,200,000 to me. Hopefully, she sees the value in closing the deal and accepts."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and $400,000 is still within my budget. However, I'd like to see if we can close the deal closer to my initial counteroffer. Let's see if I can get her down a bit more."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000}

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to $350,000. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Alice's last one, and I believe it shows that I'm serious about closing this deal. Hopefully, Alice will see the value in this price and agree."

Alice is moving closer to my target price, but I'm not willing to settle just yet.  I'll make one more counteroffer and see if we can reach an agreement."
