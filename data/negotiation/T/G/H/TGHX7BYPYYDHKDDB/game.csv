"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Can you meet me at that price?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $700000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you need to make a profit, but $850000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $725000. Can you consider this price?",725000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm going to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll sell the product to you for $825000. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $825000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to make a counteroffer of $737500. Can you consider this price?",737500.0,Bob,6,
