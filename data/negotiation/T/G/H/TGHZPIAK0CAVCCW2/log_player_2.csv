"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's initial offer. It's still too high, and he can likely get a better price by negotiating. He has 10 rounds, so there's plenty of time to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a strong counteroffer, aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows Alice he's serious about negotiating and willing to walk away if she doesn't come down closer to his desired price. While he wants to save as much as possible, he's also aware of the time limit and the alternative price from John.  This offer is still well above Alice's minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still too high.  He's likely to get a better price by continuing to negotiate. He has time on his side (7 rounds remaining), and the threat of buying from John gives him leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is raising his offer slightly, but still significantly below Alice's current offer.  He's demonstrating that he's willing to compromise, but not willing to overpay. He's also factoring in that Alice likely wants to get a deal done, and the risk of losing the sale to John may lead her to accept this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down considerably in price, and this offer is only $25,000 more than Bob's previous counteroffer.  With 5 rounds remaining, continuing to negotiate is a risk.  There's a good chance Alice will either dig in or be unwilling to come down further, and buying from John would cost Bob significantly more.  This offer allows Bob to buy the product while still saving a substantial amount compared to buying from John."
