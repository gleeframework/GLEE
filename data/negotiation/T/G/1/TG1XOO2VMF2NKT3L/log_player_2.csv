"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering a price significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still higher than John's offer. This is a strategic move to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. If Alice accepts, Bob saves a considerable amount. If Alice rejects, Bob can either counter again or move on to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget, even after her counteroffer. At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John, who is selling it at a price that aligns with Bob's budget.  Further negotiation with Alice might lead to a lower price, but there is no guarantee, and the time spent on negotiation might not be worth the potential savings."
