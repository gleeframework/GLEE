Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $90. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile."", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $90 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he wants to, while still ensuring a good profit for you.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Offering it at $99 might make Bob feel like he's being squeezed, potentially leading him to reject the offer. A slightly lower price increases the perceived fairness. 

By offering the product at $90, you strike a balance between maximizing your potential profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the deal."
