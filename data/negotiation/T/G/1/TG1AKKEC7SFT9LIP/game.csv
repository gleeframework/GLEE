"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. Given the value of the product, I'd be willing to come down to $1,200,000.  This is a significant compromise, but it's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,200,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to propose $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal worthwhile. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer the product for $1,100,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and it reflects my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,6,
