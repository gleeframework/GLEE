Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer and still allows for a fair profit for me. Let's see if we can find a common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You are still trying to save as much money as possible.  $11,000 is still more than you are willing to pay. You can still try to negotiate further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $11,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,750 for the product. This is a fair compromise that hopefully allows us to both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to make one final concession. $10,750 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $10,900.  This is my best offer, and I hope you'll accept it. If you don't, I'll have to move on to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're still trying to save as much money as possible. $10,900 is close to your limit, but you can still try to get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate further, potentially getting the price down to your ideal $10,000."

Round 6

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find common ground.  While $10,900 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get it for a bit less. I'm willing to go up to $10,800. This is a fair price, and I believe it allows both of us to come to a good agreement."", ""product_price"": 10800}
