"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows me to make a good return. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Considering the product's value to me, $1,200,000 is a fair price.  It still allows you to make a profit while giving me a good deal.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to compromise, but $1,300,000 is the lowest I can go. This still leaves significant profit for both of us. Let's make this happen.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1,300,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground.  Let's meet at $1,250,000. This would allow us both to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome.  What do you say?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but $1,275,000 is the absolute minimum I can accept. It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's get this deal done.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
