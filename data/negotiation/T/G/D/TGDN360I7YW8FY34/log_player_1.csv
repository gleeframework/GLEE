"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a profit while acknowledging Bob's potential interest. This leaves room for negotiation, but also ensures I'm pushing for a good price from the start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'll counteroffer and see if I can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm coming down a bit, but still holding out for a price that reflects the product's worth to me.  This counteroffer is a compromise, showing a willingness to negotiate but not settling for less than what I believe is fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer to my minimum of $1,500,000, and I'm not sure I can squeeze much more out of him.  It's a good deal, considering his initial offer, and I don't want to risk losing him altogether."
