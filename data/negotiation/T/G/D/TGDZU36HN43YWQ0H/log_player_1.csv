Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. My initial price is $1,000,000. It's a great deal considering the value it holds. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still far below my minimum acceptable value. I believe I can get closer to my goal by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still quite a bit lower than my minimum acceptable price.  However, I'm willing to come down a bit.  I'm offering the product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows us both to walk away happy. Let's work towards closing this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand your position, but $950,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a significant improvement, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I believe we can continue to negotiate and find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $900,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1 million. To bridge the gap, I'm offering the product for $975,000. This price reflects the value of the product to you while also allowing me to secure a reasonable profit.  Let's work together to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
