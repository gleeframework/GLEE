"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price. $12,000 is still above your maximum budget of $8,000.  You have 9 more rounds to make a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

$10,250 is still more than my budget. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $10,250 is still above my limit.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand your budget constraints.  However, $9,000 is still significantly below my minimum.  Let's compromise at $10,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

$10,000 is still more than I'm willing to pay, but I'll try to negotiate one last time. I'm not sure if we can agree, but it's worth a shot."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but I can't go higher than $9,500. It's a significant step up from my previous offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product and my budget.  Is there any way we can reach an agreement?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
