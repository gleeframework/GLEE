"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This would be a fair price for both of us.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $10,250 is still above my limit.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints.  However, $9,000 is still significantly below my minimum.  Let's compromise at $10,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but I can't go higher than $9,500. It's a significant step up from my previous offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product and my budget.  Is there any way we can reach an agreement?",9500.0,Bob,6,
