Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to $100 as possible, but you also want to make sure Bob accepts the offer.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $80, so offering it above that is necessary.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $95 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring you get a price significantly higher than his valuation. 
* **Backup Buyer:** You have John as a safety net, guaranteeing you at least $100. This allows you to aim higher with Bob."
