,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $900,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $875,000? This price is fair and reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.",875000.0,Bob,4,
