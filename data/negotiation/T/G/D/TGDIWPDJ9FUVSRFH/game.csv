"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $13000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $18000. It's still a great deal considering its value to you.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  $18000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go to $15500.  That's the very most I can afford, and it's closer to my initial budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see that you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $17000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it's the lowest I'm willing to go.",17000.0,Alice,5,
