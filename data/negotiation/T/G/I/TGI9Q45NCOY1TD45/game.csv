"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000.

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product. This price is still above your value for it, and I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiations.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save as much as possible, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $1,150,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while getting me a good price.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm offering you a final counteroffer of $1,250,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
