Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value, but leaving some room for negotiation.  I'm also aware that John is a fallback option, so I want to ensure the final price is above $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While selling to John is a viable option, I'd prefer to try and get a higher price from Bob.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm reducing the price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a price significantly higher than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'd like to get a higher price, I'm confident that selling to John will secure a price that's above my minimum requirement.  I'm also concerned that Bob might continue to lower his offers, potentially pushing me further down in terms of profit."
