Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000 is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum.** This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition.** This helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer.

**Strategy:**

This approach aims to strike a balance between getting a good price and keeping the negotiation open. By starting with a relatively high price, I can gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a deal above his initial valuation.  If Bob rejects the offer, I can use John as a leverage point to potentially push for a higher price in counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.** Accepting it would be a significant loss.
* **Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer.** This keeps the negotiation open and potentially leads to a better price.
* **Selling to John for $15,000 is always an option, but it's better to explore other options first.** The negotiation with Bob might lead to a better outcome. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum.  I'll use the fact that I have a backup buyer (John) to my advantage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $10,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500, considering your interest.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is above Bob's offer but still below my minimum.** This shows flexibility while keeping the pressure on Bob. 
* **The message emphasizes my willingness to negotiate.** This keeps the door open for a deal. 
* **The mention of Bob's interest subtly implies that I have other options.**  This can encourage him to consider a higher price.

**Strategy:**

By moving closer to Bob's offer, I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a firm stance.  This creates a sense of urgency for Bob and could potentially lead to a deal closer to my desired price."
