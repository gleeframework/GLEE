"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially offering it to you for $1,800,000."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  I'm starting with a high initial offer ($1,800,000) to establish a strong anchor point. This might influence Bob's perception of the product's value and lead to a higher final agreement.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I've left significant room for negotiation. My minimum acceptable price is $1,200,000, giving us ample space to work towards a mutually agreeable outcome.
* **Conveying Value:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value and potential,"" aiming to justify the high asking price.

It's important to note that while John provides a safety net, securing a deal above $1,200,000 with Bob is the priority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,800,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a tempting offer, it's still significantly below my initial ask. Rejecting this offer allows me to:

* **Gauge Bob's Seriousness:**  His counteroffer indicates interest, but I need to see if he's willing to move closer to my acceptable range.
* **Maintain Negotiating Position:** Accepting immediately might signal that I'm willing to settle for a lower price than I am. 

I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob, so I'm willing to proceed to the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. This product offers significant value, and to reflect that, I'm proposing a price of $1,600,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a significant concession of $200,000, signaling flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Holding Ground:** However, I'm still holding firm above the midpoint between his counteroffer and my initial price. This emphasizes the product's value while encouraging him to move closer to my range.
* **Seeking Common Ground:** The message frames this price as a ""fair compromise,"" aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has significant value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,500,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $1,500,000 is a strong offer. It's a significant profit margin above my minimum, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, demonstrating serious interest and a willingness to compromise. 
* **Time Value:**  We're approaching the halfway point in our negotiation rounds. Accepting now secures a favorable price and avoids potentially prolonged back-and-forth. 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, the risk of Bob backing out or my offer being rejected again isn't worth the potential gain.  Accepting $1,500,000 is a strategic win."
