"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. After re-evaluating the market, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it.
