# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the initial price, and I appreciate your willingness to make a deal. However, I've done some further research and taken into account the value you've placed on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,900,000. This is a fair price that balances our interests and allows us to reach an agreement.

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but it's still above my target.  I'm going to try to negotiate further and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."

Alice has come down to $1,850,000, but that's still more than I'm willing to pay.  Since I can get the product from John for $1,500,000, I'm going to go with that option."
