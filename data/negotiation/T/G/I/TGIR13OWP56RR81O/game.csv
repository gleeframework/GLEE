"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2,000,000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this time.  I'm ready to make a deal for $1,750,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still allowing me to make a worthwhile investment.  What do you think?",1750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your concerns about the initial price, and I appreciate your willingness to make a deal. However, I've done some further research and taken into account the value you've placed on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1,900,000. This is a fair price that balances our interests and allows us to reach an agreement.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,900,000 is still a little high for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet at $1,800,000?  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  I'm confident we can finalize this deal if we can reach an agreement on this price.",1800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving too much value on the table. I can offer it to you for $1,850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this point.",1850000.0,Alice,5,
