Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal considering the value of the product.  Let's try to make this work!
