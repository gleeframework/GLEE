"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a better price than John's $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $10,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $10,500.  Would you consider $11,000?  It's a small compromise for a product you know is worth more. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value for Bob:**  Bob is willing to pay up to $12,000.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is offering $11,000.
* **Saving:** This offer saves Bob $1,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting and potentially increasing the price (or Bob ending up buying from John at a higher price) outweighs the potential savings. 

Accepting Alice's offer is the most logical decision, as it secures the product at a price within Bob's budget while still providing a significant saving."
