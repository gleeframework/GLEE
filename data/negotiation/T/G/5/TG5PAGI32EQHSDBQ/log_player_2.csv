Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,800. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and her 'final offer' language suggests she's getting firm. It's not worth risking a higher price when John offers a guaranteed price at my limit."
