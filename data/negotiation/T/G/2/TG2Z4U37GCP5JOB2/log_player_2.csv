Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $11,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,200. This is a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's still a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $11,200 saves you $800 compared to John's offer, and further haggling risks her walking away."
