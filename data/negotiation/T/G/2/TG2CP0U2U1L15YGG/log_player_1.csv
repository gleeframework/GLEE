Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and thought of you since it might be right up your alley. I'm offering it to you at $22,000. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 22000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Knowing Bob values the product at $8,000 and you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, starting high allows room for negotiation.
* **Potential for higher profit:**  While the product is only worth $8,000 to Bob, he might be willing to pay more depending on its scarcity, his urgency to acquire it, or his lack of awareness about alternative options.
* **Fallback option:** If Bob rejects the offer, you're not losing anything. You can always fall back on selling to John at your minimum acceptable price. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy.  There's no guarantee Bob will accept this high price. A different approach might involve a slightly lower price to increase the chances of a quicker sale, albeit with a potentially lower profit margin."
