"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $14,000. I believe it will be very valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can likely get a better price by counteroffering.  While $14,000 is a good deal, he can potentially save more by negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I am interested, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'd be willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the product's value to me is quite high. Could you meet me halfway at $13,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he could continue negotiating, the price is now at $13,250. This is a good deal for Bob, as he can save $1,750 compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation might result in a lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting the counteroffer and Bob having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings."
