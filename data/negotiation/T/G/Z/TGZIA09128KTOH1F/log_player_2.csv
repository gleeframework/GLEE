Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit far from your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $9500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?

While Alice's offer is closer to your target price, it's still higher than your desired $8,000. It's worth another round of negotiation to see if you can get closer to your budget."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire for a compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $9000. I'm willing to offer you the product for $9200. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:

Alice has stated this is her final offer, and it's still above your desired $8,000.  You can choose to counteroffer again, but there's no guarantee Alice will budge.  Since you have a guaranteed option to buy from John for your desired price, it's the most sensible choice in this situation."
