"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but I'm only able to go up to $10000 right now. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your offer but $10000 is simply too low. This product is incredibly valuable and I'm confident it would be worth much more to you in the long run.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $14000?  I'm willing to be flexible but that's the lowest I can go.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $14000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $12000. Let's meet in the middle on this one.",12000.0,Bob,4,
