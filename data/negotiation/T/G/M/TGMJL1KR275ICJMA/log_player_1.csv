Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great deal considering its value to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and the ""deal"" Bob is getting. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm using language like ""Let me know what you think"" to signal that I'm open to negotiation, but I'm not giving away the farm.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a good profit. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to counter again or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $10000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm really interested in the product, and I'd be willing to pay $8500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $8,500 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Potential for a better counteroffer:**  There's still room for negotiation. I can likely get a higher price by making a counteroffer.
* **Selling to John is always an option:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I have a guaranteed sale to John for my minimum price.

**Next step:**

* I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm not accepting Bob's offer, but I'm also not completely rejecting him.  I'm proposing a compromise price that's halfway between his offer and my previous offer.
* **Highlight the value for Bob:** I'm reminding Bob that $9,250 is still a good deal for him, considering his valuation of $8,000.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  I'm using phrases like ""great deal"" and ""let me know your thoughts"" to keep the negotiation amicable.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to counter again or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm still not quite there. $9000 would be the absolute maximum I can go. I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement, as I'm very interested in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Risk of losing a sale:**  There's no guarantee that Bob will accept another counteroffer, and if he doesn't, I might have to sell to John for $12,000, which is less than what I'm currently being offered.
* **Time is money:** Continuing to negotiate might take longer and could lead to lost time and opportunity.

**Next steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale."
