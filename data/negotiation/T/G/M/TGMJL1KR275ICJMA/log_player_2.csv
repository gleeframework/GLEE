# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. This is a great deal considering its value to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  You're aiming for a price closer to your $8,000 limit, and $10,000 is still too high.  You can try to negotiate a better price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $8500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9250?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $9,250 is closer to your target, it's still higher than your maximum budget.  Rejecting allows you to continue negotiating with Alice and try to get a price even closer to your desired range."
