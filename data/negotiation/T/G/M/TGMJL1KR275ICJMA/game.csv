"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $10000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm really interested in the product, and I'd be willing to pay $8500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $8500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9250?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know your thoughts.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm still not quite there. $9000 would be the absolute maximum I can go. I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement, as I'm very interested in the product.",9000.0,Bob,4,
