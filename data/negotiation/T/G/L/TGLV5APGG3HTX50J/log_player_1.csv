"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $150. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price but leaves room for negotiation.  I'll see if Bob is willing to meet me there, or if we need to adjust the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm not willing to sell the product for that amount. I'll reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm countering with $130. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping that it's a price that Bob will find appealing while still allowing me to get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that price.  I'll counter with a slightly higher price to see if we can close the deal. There are still a few rounds left to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm countering with $115.  This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, but I believe it's a reasonable price considering my minimum and the limited rounds remaining. I'm hoping this offer will be accepted and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where Bob is offering $105, which is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I could continue negotiating, it's not clear if we'll reach an agreement within the remaining rounds. To avoid the risk of losing a sale altogether, I'll choose to sell to John for $120, which guarantees me a secure profit."
