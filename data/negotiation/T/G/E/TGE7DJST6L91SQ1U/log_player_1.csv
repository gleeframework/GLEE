Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,999. I think it would be a great fit for you, and this is a very competitive price."",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay even slightly more.
* **Appear Reasonable:** Starting with a price just below your guaranteed sale price makes it seem like you're offering Bob a good deal.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While this is a high initial offer, it leaves you some room to potentially negotiate down slightly if Bob shows interest but hesitates at the price. 

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob might accept this offer, even though it's significantly higher than his perceived value.  People sometimes make buying decisions based on factors beyond just the pure monetary value."
