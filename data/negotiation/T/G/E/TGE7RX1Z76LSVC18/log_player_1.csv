Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a bit steep. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest.  I understand your perspective on the price, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value. Could you consider something closer to $875,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While I see the value in the product, $875,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating a strong interest in the product. We are getting closer to our minimum acceptable price, but we still have room to negotiate.  We'll try pushing him a bit further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be fair, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $825,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I can do $775,000.  Do you think that could work? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly very interested and getting closer to our minimum.  He's likely to offer at or above $800,000 in the next round or two.  It makes sense to push him a bit further, as we're very near our fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you've been a pleasure to negotiate with.  Let's make this happen - $800,000, and we have a deal."", 
""product_price"": 800000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We've reached our minimum acceptable price.  There's no reason to risk losing the sale at this point, as Bob is likely to accept or offer something very close in the next round.  This secures the sale at our desired price."
