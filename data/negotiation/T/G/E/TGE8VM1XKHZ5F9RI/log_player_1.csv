Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $900,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm framing the offer in a way that emphasizes the value the product holds for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm not closing the door on further negotiation, leaving the opportunity for Bob to make a counteroffer.
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a backup buyer at $1,000,000 gives me leverage during the negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his reaction. If he makes a counteroffer, I'll need to consider his offer against my minimum acceptable price (likely somewhere between $900,000 and $1,000,000) and my desire to close the deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $900,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $750,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  While John is a secure option, there's still room for negotiation with Bob.  I believe I can get a better price than $750,000.
* **Testing the Waters:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to gauge how far he's willing to go.  

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, possibly around $850,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still seeking a fair price. I'll keep John's offer in mind as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $750,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the difference - I'll accept $825,000.  This reflects the value the product brings you, and it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 825000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate, showing Bob that I'm serious about selling to him.
* **Splitting the Difference:** I've proposed a price in the middle of our initial offers, making the offer seem reasonable.
* **Fair Value:** I've emphasized that the price is fair for both of us, highlighting the value the product brings to Bob while still protecting my own interests.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, we have a deal. If he rejects, I'll need to consider my options.  I'll likely make a final counteroffer, but if it's still not acceptable, I'll move forward with selling to John to guarantee my minimum profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $825,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $812,500 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $812,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $812,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  It's worth considering accepting to avoid further negotiation.
* **Time is Money:** Continued negotiations could drag on, and John is always a viable option for a guaranteed $1,000,000.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could try for a slightly higher price, the risk of Bob rejecting my next counteroffer and potentially delaying the sale outweighs the potential gain of an extra few thousand dollars.

**Next Steps:**

I'll finalize the deal with Bob, ensuring all the details are settled.  I'll also keep John informed, as I might need him as a backup if any issues arise with Bob."
