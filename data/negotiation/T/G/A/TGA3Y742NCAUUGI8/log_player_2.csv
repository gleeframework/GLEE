"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,500 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is a better price than John's $12,000, Bob can potentially get a better deal by counteroffering.  There are 9 rounds left, and Alice has room to lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  How about $10,500?  That's still a good price for you and leaves some room for us to work together."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference?  $11,000 is a fair price that still leaves some room for both of us to benefit. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is closer to his goal than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting, Bob can continue to try and lower the price further.  There are 7 rounds left, so there is still time to work out a deal that is beneficial for both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,750. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
