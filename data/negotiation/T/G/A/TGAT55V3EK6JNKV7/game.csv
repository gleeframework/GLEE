"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a high starting point.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see a price closer to $600,000 for it to make sense for me. ",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $900,000, which is a significant discount from my initial price. This is my best offer so far, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my range. To be honest, $800,000 is the highest I can go. If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to close the deal.  Otherwise, I might need to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm close to your target, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $820,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can seal the deal.",820000.0,Alice,5,
