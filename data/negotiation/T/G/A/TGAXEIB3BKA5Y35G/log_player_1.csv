{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts high, acknowledging the product's value to Bob while still leaving room for negotiation. It also sets the tone for a positive and potentially profitable interaction.  I'm open to negotiation and ready to consider Bob's counteroffers, but I also have a fallback option with John, which gives me a strong position."

Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
