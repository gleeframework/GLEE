Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm confident that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it.

While Bob is showing interest, his offers are escalating too slowly. It's unlikely he'll reach a price point that's significantly better than what John is offering. Accepting John's offer guarantees the $1,000,000 and avoids further negotiation."
