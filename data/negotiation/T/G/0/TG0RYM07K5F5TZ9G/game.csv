"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm very interested in the product, but I can't go above $1,250,000. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen!",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,250,000 is appealing, the value this product brings is substantial.  Could you consider $1,375,000? I'm confident it's a price that reflects the value while remaining a smart investment for you.",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value of this product, but $1,375,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm prepared to go up to $1,300,000. I believe this offer is fair and represents a significant investment for me. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
