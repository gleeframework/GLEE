Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm very interested in the product, but I can't go above $1,250,000. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,250,000 is appealing, the value this product brings is substantial.  Could you consider $1,375,000? I'm confident it's a price that reflects the value while remaining a smart investment for you."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of this product, but $1,375,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm prepared to go up to $1,300,000. I believe this offer is fair and represents a significant investment for me. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 
 
At this point, Bob is showing willingness to move closer to my price, and $1,300,000 is a solid profit above my minimum. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk him lowering his offer or walking away in later rounds."
