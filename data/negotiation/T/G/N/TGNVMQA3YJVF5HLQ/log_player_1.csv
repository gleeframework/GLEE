"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's valued at over a million dollars to me, but I understand it might be worth less to you.  I'm willing to start the negotiation at $900,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is a significant amount of money, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't settle for a price that's so far below my minimum.  I have 8 rounds left, and I believe I can get a better price."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is too far below my minimum.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and it's the best I can offer right now.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 4

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has shown some willingness to compromise, his offer of $775,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I have 6 rounds left, and I believe I can still get a better price.  I will continue to negotiate with Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $775,000 is still not in the ballpark of what I need to make this deal work.

Let's close this deal, I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 825000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is inching closer to my desired price range, his offer of $795,000 is still too low. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to settle for anything below $800,000. I have 4 rounds left, and I'm confident I can achieve a more favorable price."
