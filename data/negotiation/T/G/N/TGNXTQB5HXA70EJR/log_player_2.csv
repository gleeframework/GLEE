"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm willing to part with it for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above Bob's maximum budget. It makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. $10,000 is quite low, but I understand your budget constraints. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum price point.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice is willing to go lower."
