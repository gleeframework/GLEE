"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my reach.  I'm firm on my budget of $10,000.  If you're not willing to go lower, I'll have to move on to another seller.",10000.0,Bob,4,
