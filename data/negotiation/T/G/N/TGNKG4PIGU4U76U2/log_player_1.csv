Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $170. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a positive tone helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Emphasis:** Mentioning the product's higher worth subtly reinforces its value to Bob. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while still keeping the negotiation open for Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure if $170 is a good deal for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I want to make a deal, accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss.  

I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range. This keeps the negotiation going while pushing Bob to consider a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $145. Let's work together to find a price that's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 145} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a middle ground, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Fairness Focus:**  ""Fair for both of us"" emphasizes the collaborative aspect of the negotiation.
* **Still Above Minimum:** $145 is still above my minimum of $150, but closer to Bob's offer. This keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from $145. How about we meet in the middle at $130? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob and get some profit, his offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay $150, it's more beneficial to sell to John and avoid further negotiation with Bob.  This ensures I don't lose money and still achieve my goal of earning at least $150."
