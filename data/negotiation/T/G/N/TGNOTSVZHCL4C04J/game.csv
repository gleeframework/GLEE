"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $8,500? This would still be a great value for you, and it's closer to where I need to be.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $8,500 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $8,250. This represents a good compromise, and I believe it's still a very fair price for the value you'll get from this product.",8250.0,Alice,5,
