"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping this will encourage him to counteroffer, allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial price. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer down slightly in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm open to negotiation, I can't accept such a low offer.  I will counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
``` 

I'm offering the product for $1,200,000. This is my minimum acceptable price and reflects the value of the product to me. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but it's getting closer.  I will continue to negotiate with him, hoping to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $1,100,000. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. I'm still confident that this price reflects the value of the product, and I believe Bob may be willing to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I'm willing to continue the process.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm offering the product for $1,050,000.  This is a compromise, meeting halfway between Bob's last offer and my previous one.  I'm hoping this will be a good enough incentive for Bob to finally agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still slightly below my minimum acceptable price, we're nearing the end of negotiations.  I've already rejected several counteroffers and am running out of time.  Accepting Bob's offer at $1,025,000 will allow me to close the deal and secure a decent profit.  I'm also concerned that if I continue to reject his offers, he might withdraw entirely, leaving me with only the option of selling to John."
