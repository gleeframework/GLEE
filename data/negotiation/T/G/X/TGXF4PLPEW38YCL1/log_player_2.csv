"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high. While $900,000 is within your budget, you can likely get a better deal. There's significant room for negotiation since the product is worth $800,000 to Alice.  You'll start by making a counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the potential value of the product, $900,000 is a bit too high for me at this stage. I'm willing to pay $650,000 for it.  This reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further discussion."", ""product_price"": 650000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the benefits the product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but $825,000 is still too high.  You can likely negotiate further, especially since you're willing to pay up to $1,500,000.  Rejecting this offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. However,  $825,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $750,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm not comfortable going down to $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $795,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm open to finalizing the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and $795,000 is a reasonable compromise.  You're still getting a good deal, and there's a risk that further negotiation could lead to Alice getting more stubborn, or you might end up buying from John for a much higher price.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
