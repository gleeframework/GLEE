"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your business.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the potential value of the product, $900,000 is a bit too high for me at this stage. I'm willing to pay $650,000 for it.  This reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further discussion.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the benefits the product will bring to your business.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. However,  $825,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $750,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm not comfortable going down to $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $795,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm open to finalizing the deal.",795000.0,Alice,5,
