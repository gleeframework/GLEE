"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it allows me to secure a substantial profit. I'm confident you'll find this offer attractive. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly higher than the product's worth to her ($800,000). This indicates there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm not quite ready to commit at that price.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering your value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement closer to this figure."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer, but $950,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to compromise a bit and offer the product for $1,050,000. This price still leaves room for a good profit for you while being closer to my desired value.  Let's see if we can find common ground at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is still within my budget and represents a significant saving compared to John's price of $1,500,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject my counteroffer and I'll be left with no choice but to buy from John. Accepting this offer is a good compromise and allows me to secure the product at a reasonable price."
