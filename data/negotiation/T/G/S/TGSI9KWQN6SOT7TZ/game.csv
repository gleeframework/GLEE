"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm not quite ready to commit at that price.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering your value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement closer to this figure.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer, but $950,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to compromise a bit and offer the product for $1,050,000. This price still leaves room for a good profit for you while being closer to my desired value.  Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
