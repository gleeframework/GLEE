"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave some room for negotiation. It's also still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150, so I'm not losing out if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, I can't accept something that's so far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer, hoping to find a compromise. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle at $112.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not desperate to sell, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're trying to meet in the middle, but $112.50 is still too low for me.  How about we try $118.75? This is a significant compromise from my last offer, and it's getting closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 118.75} 
```

I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's above my minimum. I'm emphasizing the compromise I'm making, hoping to nudge him towards accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest with you, my budget is capped at $120. If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to buy right now.  Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price. Although I'd prefer to get more, I'm willing to accept it to avoid risking a sale to John for less. This also shows Bob that I'm serious about closing the deal."
