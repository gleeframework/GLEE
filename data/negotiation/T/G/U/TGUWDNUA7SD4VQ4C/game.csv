"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $700,000 is a bit too far below my asking price. However, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $900,000? It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000.  Would that price point be workable for you?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $750,000 is still a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me on this.  I'm getting close to my limit, but could you do $825,000?",825000.0,Bob,6,
