{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $1,200,000 to you. Let's close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to an agreement on a price closer to what I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,250,000 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and there's a chance he might come closer to my price.  

Additionally, I have the option to sell to John for my desired price, so there's no immediate need to accept a lower offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,250,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,325,000?  This would give you a good deal, and it would be closer to my desired price. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1325000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000, but I'd like to see if we can get even closer to my target. Can you consider a price of $1,275,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $1,275,000 is still significantly below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000. With 6 rounds left, there's potential to negotiate further and secure a better deal. Moreover, I have the option to sell to John for my desired price, providing a safety net."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to go up to $1,285,000, but I'd like to see if we can get even closer to my target. Can you consider a price of $1,285,000?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even though Bob's offer is the highest yet, it's still significantly below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000.  With only 4 rounds remaining, there's still an opportunity to negotiate further and potentially achieve a better deal. Also, I have the option to sell to John for my desired price, providing a safety net and preventing me from settling for a price I'm not comfortable with."

{""message"": ""Bob, we've been going back and forth for a while, and while I appreciate your efforts, $1,285,000 is still too far from my desired price.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to at least get $1,350,000 for this product. This offer would give you a good price while ensuring a fair deal for me.  Let's finalize this transaction and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
