"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm confident you'll love it, and I think you'll be impressed by its features and benefits. Would you like to make an offer for this product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is at your maximum price point.  There's no immediate benefit to accepting.  Rejecting allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant discount from Alice's initial price.  It's aggressive but still within the realm of possibility.  It's a good starting point for negotiation."

# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you a price of $1300000 for the product. This is my best counteroffer so far, and I'm not sure I can go any lower.
