"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this high-quality item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great price, considering the product's worth to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500. This is a fair price considering your own valuation and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $8,500 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my own minimum price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can close the deal this round. ",8500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $9,000 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $8,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me and my own minimum price. I hope we can come to an agreement this round.",8800.0,Alice,5,
