Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500. This is a fair price considering your own valuation and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
