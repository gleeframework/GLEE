"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point considering the benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  This price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your initial offer.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $11,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This price is fair considering my financial limitations and the product's value. I hope we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  While $11,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still seeking a slightly higher price. Would you consider $11,750? This allows me to acknowledge your position while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,750 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $11,500.  This is a fair price that considers both our needs, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,6,
