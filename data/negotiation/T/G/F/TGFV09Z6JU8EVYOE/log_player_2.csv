"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a fair price.  How does $10,000 sound?  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $12,000. By rejecting her offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with her or proceeding to buy from John for $12,000."
