"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that Bob values the product at $80. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully close the deal at a price closer to my desired $100. I'm also being friendly and positive in my message, hoping to build rapport and make Bob more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price of $100.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a price closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $90 is a little lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a great price for such a high-quality item.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

I'm counter-offering at $105, which is still higher than Bob's offer but closer to my desired price. I'm being positive and emphasizing the value of the product to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $85 is a more reasonable price. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is getting closer to Bob's valuation of $80, I'm still not comfortable selling for that low. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $85 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $95.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm counter-offering at $95, which is a compromise between my desired price and Bob's offer. I'm reiterating my willingness to negotiate while also emphasizing the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not sure about the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $82? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

At this point, Bob's offer is getting very close to his valuation of $80, which is significantly lower than my desired price of $100.  It's clear that we're not going to agree on a price that's mutually acceptable. Since I have the option to sell to John for $100, I'm going to take that offer and end the negotiation with Bob."
