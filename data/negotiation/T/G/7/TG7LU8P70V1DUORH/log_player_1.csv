Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm also prepared to lower my price if necessary to secure a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get a little more.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $9,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway. It's still above my minimum price, but shows I'm willing to be flexible. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair price and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to go lower than my minimum price.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000. It's not the ideal price, but it's better than selling for less than my minimum and it guarantees a sale."
