"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll find very useful. I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's halfway between my minimum and Bob's potential value, aiming for a good starting point for negotiation. This leaves room for me to adjust the price if needed, but still ensures I'm making a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $95? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $95. I'm willing to go up to $92. Can we meet in the middle at $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer for $92. It's a good compromise, and the negotiation has gone on for a few rounds. While I could potentially try for a slightly higher price, there's no guarantee Bob will agree, and the risk of losing the deal isn't worth it at this point. $92 is a significant profit for me, and it's a good outcome."
