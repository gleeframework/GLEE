"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting high, at $1,200,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it gives me some room to negotiate. It also reflects the product's true worth to me, which is $1,000,000.  I'm willing to sell to John for that price, so any deal with Bob must be better. 

Let's see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is too low.  It's significantly less than what the product is worth to me and even below his own perceived value. I'm not going to accept this offer. I'll counteroffer and try to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product for $1,000,000.  This is my minimum acceptable price, as I can sell it to John for that amount. It's also closer to Bob's perceived value of $800,000, making a deal more likely. Let's see if Bob bites."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While I would prefer to get closer to $1,000,000, I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by continuing to negotiate. There are only 6 rounds left, and I'm not sure if Bob will budge further.  Accepting this offer allows me to secure a good deal and avoid the potential of ending up with nothing."
