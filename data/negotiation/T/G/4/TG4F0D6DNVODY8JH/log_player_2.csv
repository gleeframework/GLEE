# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this amazing product, but I have to be honest with you, I've had other interested buyers who are willing to pay top dollar for it. I'm thinking of selling it to them if you're not interested. The price I'm willing to offer you is $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
