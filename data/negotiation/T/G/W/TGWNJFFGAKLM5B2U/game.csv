"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,250,000.  This seems like a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,275,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair for both of us. What are your thoughts?",1275000.0,Alice,3,
