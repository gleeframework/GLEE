"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business and I'm confident you'll love it.

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm open to further negotiations to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $900000 just yet. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. With that in mind, I'm willing to offer $850000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me, and I'm open to further negotiations to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, I'm still not quite ready to accept $875000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's value to me. With that in mind, I'm willing to offer $860000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm open to further negotiations to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",860000.0,Alice,5,
