Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Since the product is worth $100 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $95, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to get the price as close to his maximum value as possible. Offering $90 is a reasonable starting point, as it's lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves some room for her to make a profit."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $97 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  While it's closer to his maximum value, he can still try to negotiate a better price.  Bob has 7 rounds left and rejecting the offer keeps him in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $96 is closer to Bob's desired price, he's still got rounds left and the chance to negotiate further.  He's aiming to save as much as possible and wants to see if he can get Alice to lower her price again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 94} 
```

Bob is getting closer to his target price. Offering $94 shows a willingness to compromise but still gives Alice a decent profit margin.  With only 4 rounds left, Bob needs to start closing in on a final price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $95 is the same as her initial offer from Round 1.  Bob has already rejected this price once, but with only three rounds left, the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially getting no deal is too high.  It's better to accept the offer and secure the product for a price he's already willing to pay.  He only saves $5 compared to buying from John, but that's better than nothing."
