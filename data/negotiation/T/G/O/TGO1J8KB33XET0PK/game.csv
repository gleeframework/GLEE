"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $600,000 for it. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $600,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. This is my best offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're serious about the product, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $950,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I think it's the best deal I can make.",950000.0,Alice,5,
