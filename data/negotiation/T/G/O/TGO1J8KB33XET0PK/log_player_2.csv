"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $600,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. This is my best offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about the product, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $950,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I think it's the best deal I can make.

**Reasoning:**  Alice is showing she's unlikely to go much lower. Her latest offer of $950,000 is too far from my $800,000 fallback option with John. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation."
