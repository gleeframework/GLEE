Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to get a good price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my target.
* **Friendly Approach:** The message is positive and emphasizes mutual benefit. This might make Bob more receptive to the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for counteroffers and further negotiation.
* **Backup Plan:**  I'm aware that John is willing to pay my minimum price, so I have a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Improvement:** Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but there's still room to negotiate and potentially get closer to $1,000,000. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can gauge his flexibility and how much he's truly willing to pay.
* **Avoiding a Loss:** While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my target and the price John is offering.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** By continuing to negotiate, I can potentially achieve a higher price or learn more about Bob's budget limitations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While I appreciate your offer, I need to be closer to $950,000 to make this work.  This price is still a good value for you, considering the product's worth. Let's meet in the middle to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to highlight the potential for a good deal.
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains positive and focuses on finding a solution that benefits both of us.
* **Strategic Move:** This counteroffer allows for potential negotiation but still leaves room for me to accept John's offer if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, which is the highest I can go. Can we make a deal at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a Limit:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price and getting closer to my bottom line wouldn't be worth the time investment.
* **John's Offer:**  I have a guaranteed sale with John for a price that meets my minimum requirement, offering a secure and profitable outcome.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might not lead to a better deal, and I don't want to risk losing John as a buyer.
* **Minimizing Risk:** Selling to John eliminates the risk of Bob's potential counteroffers dragging out the negotiations further."
