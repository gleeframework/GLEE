{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars with further negotiation, the risk of Alice walking away or Bob having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings.  At this point, accepting Alice's offer is the most prudent choice."
