"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1100000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1050000.  This is a significant step closer to your last offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I'm glad to see we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm now offering the product to you for $1075000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
