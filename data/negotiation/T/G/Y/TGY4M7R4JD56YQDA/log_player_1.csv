Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price seems a little high for me.  Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $7,000, I'm hoping I can get closer to my desired price range with a counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  Let's make this work!"", ""product_price"": 8500}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $7,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm going to try to counteroffer one more time before considering selling to John."
