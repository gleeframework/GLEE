"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1200000 is a good starting point, I'm still aiming for a higher value given the unique potential of this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1350000?  I believe this price reflects the value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1100000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Given the product's potential and the value I know it holds, I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This is a final compromise on my end, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
