"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1150000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to at least get $1250000 for this product.  It's a fair price considering the value it provides to you. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good price for the product, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1200000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we agree on that price?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
