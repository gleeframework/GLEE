"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm confident this will be a worthwhile investment for you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, however,  $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  I believe this price point represents a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident that $950,000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
