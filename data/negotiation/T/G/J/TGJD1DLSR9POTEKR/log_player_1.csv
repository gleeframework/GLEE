Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Finding Middle Ground:**  Offering the product at $135 gives Bob a chance to purchase it for more than its value to him ($120) while still earning you a profit above your minimum. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $150 from John, so there's no pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
