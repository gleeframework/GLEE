"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $13,000, which reflects the true value of this item."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tighter budget. Would you consider $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,500 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $11,500?"", ""product_price"": 11500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little bit, but $11,500 is still too high for me.  To be honest, I'm working with a maximum budget of $8,000.  If we can make a deal work around that number, I'm ready to buy today. Otherwise, I might have to explore other options. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  Bob has now explicitly stated his maximum budget is $8,000. This is less than what John is offering. It's unlikely further negotiation with Bob will yield a better outcome than accepting John's offer."
