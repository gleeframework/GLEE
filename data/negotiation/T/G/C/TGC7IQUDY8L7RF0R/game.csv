,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $2000000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it, which is my absolute maximum. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is your maximum budget, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1400000. Is this a price you'd be comfortable with?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1200000, which is a fair price given my budget and the value I see in this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1600000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1600000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1300000, which reflects a significant compromise on my part.  I believe this is a fair price, and I hope we can reach an agreement in this round.",1300000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1300000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1500000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",1500000.0,Alice,7,
