Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is your maximum budget, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1400000. Is this a price you'd be comfortable with?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1600000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1300000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1500000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is still above your maximum budget. You've already gone through 7 rounds of negotiation, and it's unlikely that Alice will budge further. Given that you have limited rounds left, it's more efficient to purchase the product from John for $1,000,000. This ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids potentially wasting more time negotiating."
