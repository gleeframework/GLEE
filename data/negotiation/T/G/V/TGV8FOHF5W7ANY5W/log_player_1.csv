Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. I believe I can offer you $100 for the product, which aligns closely with its value to you. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I will reject Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better price. Even though his offer aligns with my minimum value, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is just a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $110.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product to you, I would like to propose a price of $105. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob has met me halfway and the offer is only $5 below my minimum acceptable price. I don't want to risk losing the sale and having to settle for John's $100 offer."
