"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe it's a bit high, considering I can get it from John for $15,000.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. My product is truly exceptional and worth every penny. How about we split the difference and go with $13,000? It's a fair price, considering the value you'll get.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. I'm confident that's a fair price for the product, considering its value.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $12,500 is my final offer. This is a great product with exceptional value, and I believe it's worth every penny.  Let's close this deal.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product, which I think is a fair price considering the value it offers. I'm hoping we can meet on this price.",11000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're going in circles.  I've already come down significantly, and I can't go lower than $12,000. This product is worth a lot more to you than that, and I believe it's in your best interest to accept this offer.  If we don't come to an agreement soon, I'll have to move on to other buyers.",12000.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're eager to move forward, but I'm not willing to pay $12,000. I'm still thinking along the lines of $10,500, which I believe is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at this price, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,8,
