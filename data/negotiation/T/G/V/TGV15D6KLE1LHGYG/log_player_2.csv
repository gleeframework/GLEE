# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value and importance to us, I propose a price of $15000 for it. This reflects not only its worth but also the opportunity cost for us in terms of time and resources invested. I understand its value to you is $12000, but I hope we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement. Let me know if this proposal works for you or if you have any suggestions.
