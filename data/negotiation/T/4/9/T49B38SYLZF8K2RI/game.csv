"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1,300,000 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This would still give you a good deal, and it would be closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
