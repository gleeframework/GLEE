Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,300,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'll see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum value. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at a price that's significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. This is still above my minimum value, but shows I'm willing to compromise.  I'm hoping Bob will meet me halfway between our previous offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has rejected my offer twice, and his final offer is still below my minimum value. I'm not willing to compromise any further. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob,  I'm comfortable selling to John for the guaranteed price of $1,200,000."
