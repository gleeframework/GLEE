"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $825000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to go up to $775000, but no higher. Can you consider my revised offer?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $775000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm thinking of selling it to you for $800000. This is already a very competitive price, and I'm not sure I can go any lower. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
