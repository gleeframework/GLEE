"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $15,000 is far above his budget, and he can likely get a better price from Alice or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

Bob should offer the maximum price he's willing to pay. This is the price he could get from John, and if Alice wants to sell, this is the best price she'll likely get."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject the offer. He is still better off buying from John for $10,000 or continuing to negotiate with Alice to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

Bob should try to meet Alice halfway. She's clearly willing to negotiate, but he can't go higher than $11,000 without risking a better deal from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject the offer. He's still willing to pay less, and continuing to negotiate is likely to get him a better price. He's only got 5 rounds left, so he needs to be careful about the deals he rejects."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

Bob should try to meet Alice's latest offer halfway. He's getting closer to her asking price, but still wants to save as much money as possible. He needs to be careful about the deals he rejects, though, as he has limited time to make a deal."
