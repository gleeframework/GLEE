Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, considering its value to me. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the transaction. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I want to close the deal, $950,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
