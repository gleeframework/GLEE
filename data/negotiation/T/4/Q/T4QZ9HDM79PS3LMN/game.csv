"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $180. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",180.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to make a reasonable offer, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $160. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not sure I can stretch to $160. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $140. What do you think?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $140 just yet. I'm willing to compromise and offer you $152. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. What do you think?",152.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $152. I'd like to try to get closer to my budget of $150. How about we meet at $145? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",145.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $155. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $145 and $155. How about we try $150.50?",150.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $150.50. I'd like to try to get as close to my budget as possible. How about we meet at $149.99? I'm willing to make a small concession, but I'd like to stay as close to $150 as possible.",149.99,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get as close to your budget as possible, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $152. I think this is the lowest I can go and still make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $149.99 and $152. How about we try $151.00?",151.0,Alice,9,
