"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1000000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's very fair for both of us.  Let's talk about a price of $950000. This would allow you a significant profit while still ensuring I receive a strong return on my investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.
