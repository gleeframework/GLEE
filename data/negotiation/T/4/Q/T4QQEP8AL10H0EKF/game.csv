,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Considering the value to me, I'm willing to pay $8,500. This is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,500 is still a bit low considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $9,500, which is a reasonable compromise. It's important for me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,5,
