Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of your product, I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. How about considering a price of $750,000 for the product?

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm hoping to get a better price. I'll try to counter-offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $850,000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I've reviewed our previous discussions and believe we can find a fair price. How about $800,000 for the product? This aligns closely with your original asking price and offers a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

This is a good deal for me, as Bob's offer matches my minimum price.  It's better to secure the sale than to risk losing the deal and having to rely on John's offer."
