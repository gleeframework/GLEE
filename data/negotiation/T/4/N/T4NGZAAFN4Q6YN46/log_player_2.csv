{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's roughly 17% lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows I'm serious about negotiating and willing to walk away if the price isn't right.  It's important to be aggressive in the early rounds to establish a lower baseline."
