{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I'm offering for sale. I'm asking $200 for it. I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation while still securing a profit above your minimum.  It also includes a friendly message to build rapport and gauge Bob's initial interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $100 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counteroffer to try and reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $175. This still gives me a fair price, and it's a significant discount from my original offer.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $175 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $150.  This is my final offer. If it's not acceptable, I'll have to look elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's final offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not willing to risk further negotiation.  Selling to John for $150 guarantees me my minimum profit and avoids potential complications with further negotiation."
