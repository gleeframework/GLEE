Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Would you be willing to consider my counteroffer?

Bob's offer is getting too close to my minimum price. I don't want to risk losing out on a better deal with John, who is already willing to pay my minimum price.  It's time to move on and sell the product to John."
