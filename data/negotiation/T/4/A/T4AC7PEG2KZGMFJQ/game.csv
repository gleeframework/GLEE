"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $140 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $160? It's a fair price for a product worth so much to you.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable going that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $155? I'm sure you'll find that a fair price considering the value of this product.",155.0,Alice,5,
