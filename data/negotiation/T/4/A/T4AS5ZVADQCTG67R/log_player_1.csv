Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $140. I believe it's a great deal and would be valuable to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible without going below our minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 allows for some potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Secure a Sale:**  While John offers a guaranteed $150, there's a chance Bob will accept $140, netting a quicker sale.

This strategy aims to balance securing a sale with maximizing the potential profit from Bob."
