"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to make a generous offer to you today. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's a good starting point, I can likely get a better price. 
* **I have 10 rounds.** This gives me room to negotiate and try to drive down the price.
* **Buying from John is a backup option.** If negotiations with Alice fail, I can still buy the product for $1,000,000. 

**Next Steps:**

I will send Alice a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still a bit high.**  While she's come down from her initial offer, I believe I can still get a lower price.
* **I have 7 rounds left.**  This gives me time to continue negotiating and hopefully drive the price down further.
* **Buying from John is still a backup option.** If I can't secure a better price from Alice, I can always buy the product from John.

**Next Steps:**

I will send Alice another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm prepared to offer $860,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal quickly.  Let's try to get this done."", ""product_price"": 860000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to give up too much. I'm willing to compromise again and offer the product to you for $870,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer to my desired price.**  Her offer of $870,000 is only $10,000 away from my last counteroffer.
* **I'm running out of time.**  With 5 rounds left, I'm not sure I can get a better price.
* **The risk of buying from John is significant.**  His price is $130,000 higher than Alice's offer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Alice's offer and purchase the product for $870,000. While it's not the absolute lowest price, it's a reasonable compromise and saves me a substantial amount compared to buying from John."
