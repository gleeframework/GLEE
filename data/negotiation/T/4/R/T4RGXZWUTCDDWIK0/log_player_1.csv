Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this reflects a fair deal considering its worth to both of us."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) without pushing him away. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The initial offer is a strong starting point, but leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price.
* **Backup Plan:** We know we have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so there's no pressure to go below that amount.

By starting high but remaining reasonable, Alice aims to secure the best possible outcome for herself in this negotiation."
