Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,350,000.  This is a one-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible without losing him to a guaranteed sale with John ($1,000,000).
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,350,000 leaves a significant profit margin for me while still offering Bob a substantial discount compared to his perceived value.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By calling it a ""one-time offer,"" I'm adding a bit of pressure for Bob to act quickly and not risk missing out."
