"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's close to Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm aiming for a collaborative atmosphere, emphasizing mutual benefit. 
* **Open to discussion:** I'm inviting Bob to respond, showing I'm open to negotiation.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **John's offer:** I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net, but I'm trying to get the best possible price from Bob.
* **Multiple rounds:** I have 10 rounds, so there's time to negotiate. I'm not rushing into a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $10,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  I believe I can get a better price from Bob.  He's already shown interest and has a higher perceived value for the product. 
* **Multiple rounds:**  I have more rounds to work with. 

**Next Steps:** I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but still lower than Bob's perceived value, aiming for a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too far off for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  That's still a fair price for both of us, given the product's value. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by lowering my price from $14,000.
* **Value proposition:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my counteroffer.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and collaborative approach.
* **Strategic price point:** $13,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still below Bob's perceived value, leaving room for further negotiation.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **John's offer:** While $12,000 is my floor, I'm aiming for a better deal with Bob.
* **Multiple rounds:** I still have several rounds to find a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that we need to find a compromise. How about $11,500? That's a significant step from my previous offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While $11,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price and my minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiation potential:** Bob is clearly interested in the product and is moving closer to my price range. There's still room for negotiation. 
* **Multiple rounds:**  I have multiple rounds to find a more favorable price.

**Next Steps:**  I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, but higher than Bob's latest offer, aiming to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer. $11,500 is closer, but I'm still looking to get closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? This would give us both a fair deal, and we can move forward."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and split the difference:** This strategy signals a willingness to meet halfway while still securing a price above my minimum.
* **Focus on fairness:** Emphasizing ""fair deal"" for both parties strengthens the negotiation position.
* **Clear and concise offer:** A straightforward offer leaves no room for misinterpretation.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **John's offer:** This offer is still above John's price, leaving room for potential profit.
* **Multiple rounds:** The remaining rounds allow for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  Let's settle this right now. How about $12,000 even? That's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,000 matches my minimum acceptable price.
* **No further negotiation:** There's little room for further negotiation, and I'm unlikely to get a higher offer from Bob.
* **Avoiding risk:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees the sale and eliminates the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price or a deal falling through. 
* **Time constraint:**  We're approaching the halfway point in the negotiations, and I want to secure the deal before potentially losing more time.

**Strategic Considerations:**

* **John's offer:**  While John is willing to pay $12,000, accepting Bob's offer avoids the need to sell to John and potentially missing out on a higher price in the future rounds.
* **Opportunity cost:**  By accepting Bob's offer, I am forgoing the possibility of a higher price, but the risk of further negotiation is too high at this point."
