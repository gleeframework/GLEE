"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too far off for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  That's still a fair price for both of us, given the product's value. Let's find a middle ground.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that we need to find a compromise. How about $11,500? That's a significant step from my previous offer.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer. $11,500 is closer, but I'm still looking to get closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? This would give us both a fair deal, and we can move forward.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  Let's settle this right now. How about $12,000 even? That's a fair deal for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,6,
