"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value ($10,000). This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Expressing Value:** I emphasize the product's unique value to pique Bob's interest and make him consider the offer seriously. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message leaves the door open for negotiation, making it clear I'm willing to discuss the price. 
* **Setting the Stage:**  By starting high and emphasizing value, I aim to establish a good starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product might be high for you, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $12000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While $12,000 is better than my minimum, it's still significantly below the value I'm aiming for.
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially get a higher price.
* **Not Selling to John Yet:**  I'm not ready to accept John's offer yet. I have 8 rounds left, and I believe I can likely get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $14,000, reflecting your budget constraints while ensuring I get a fair price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by reducing my price to $14,000. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise and increases the chances of reaching a deal.
* **Highlighting Value:** I subtly remind Bob of the product's value by mentioning a ""fair price,"" reinforcing the idea that it's worth more than his initial offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message remains open-ended, suggesting I'm willing to continue negotiating if necessary.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** $14,000 is still above my minimum value, so I'm not settling for a low price just yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet my budget constraints. I am still looking for a price closer to my limit. I am willing to pay $13000 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I believe the product is worth.
* **Negotiation Continues:**  Rejecting allows me to continue negotiating and see if I can push for a slightly higher price.
* **Not Selling to John Yet:** I'm not desperate to sell to John yet. I have more rounds and see potential for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to go down to $13,500, but that's my final offer.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm signaling this is my last concession, creating a sense of urgency for Bob.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** $13,500 splits the difference between my last offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm flexible.
* **Considering Other Options:** Mentioning ""other options"" (John) subtly implies I'm not desperate, increasing my leverage.
* **Above Minimum:**  This price remains above my minimum, so I'm not making a significant sacrifice."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I am willing to pay $13200 for the product. This is my best offer, and I hope it's within your range to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  Bob's offer is only $300 below my last offer, and we're approaching the midpoint of our negotiation range.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate risks the chance of Bob walking away or me having to settle with John for less.
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 4 rounds left, accepting this offer secures a relatively good price and minimizes the risk of getting a worse outcome.
* **Above Minimum:** $13,200 is still significantly above my minimum of $10,000, making this a worthwhile deal."
