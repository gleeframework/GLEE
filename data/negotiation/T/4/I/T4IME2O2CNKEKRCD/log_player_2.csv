"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** It's above your maximum budget, and you can potentially get a better deal. 
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price.** You have 10 rounds, so there's time to explore a better deal with Alice. 
* **Buying from John is a last resort.** While you have the option, it's not the most favorable choice at this point, as it will cost you your maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** I'm offering a price slightly above Alice's minimum value of $1,000,000. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but also signals that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Room for negotiation:**  This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation in the remaining rounds.
* **Avoiding immediate John purchase:** This offer is significantly cheaper than buying from John, making it a more desirable option.

**Note:** This is just a starting point. The best strategy for the next rounds will depend on how Alice reacts."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above your desired price range. 
* **Rejecting again allows further negotiation.**  You have multiple rounds left, and there's a good chance Alice might come down further.
* **Buying from John is still not ideal.** You're still better off trying to negotiate a better deal with Alice, even if it takes a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:**  I'm increasing my offer by $50,000, showing a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a negotiating position.
* **Staying below Alice's offer:** This offer keeps me below Alice's most recent offer of $1,300,000, demonstrating a desire to find a middle ground.
* **Room for compromise:** There's still a gap between our offers, allowing for further rounds of negotiation. 
* **Avoiding John:** This is a more attractive option than buying from John, given the potential for a better price with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's dropped slightly, it's still significantly more than your desired price range.
* **More rounds available:** You have five rounds remaining, which gives you ample time to continue negotiating.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Alice might be willing to drop her price further if you continue to reject her offers.
* **John's offer is still a last resort:** Buying from John is only a good option if you're unable to reach a more favorable deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:** I'm again increasing my offer by $50,000, signaling a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price.
* **Staying below Alice's offer:** This keeps me below Alice's latest offer of $1,350,000, showing a desire to find a middle ground.
* **Midway point:** This offer is roughly halfway between your last offer and Alice's last offer, demonstrating a willingness to meet in the middle.
* **Time is ticking:** We are approaching the halfway point of the negotiation, so it's important to start closing the gap. 
* **Avoiding John:** This is still a better option than buying from John at this point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's getting closer to your maximum budget, you're still better off trying to get a lower price. 
* **Only three rounds left:** You have a limited number of rounds to negotiate. However, rejecting this offer keeps you in the game.
* **John's offer is getting more attractive:**  With only three rounds remaining, buying from John becomes a more viable option if you don't reach a favorable deal with Alice. However, you should still try to negotiate with Alice first.

**Next Move:**  You need to be more aggressive with your counteroffer. You have a limited number of rounds, and Alice might be willing to accept a price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Larger increase:** I'm increasing my offer by $50,000, showing more urgency and demonstrating a willingness to move closer to Alice's price.
* **Closing the gap:** This offer is significantly closer to Alice's last offer of $1,400,000.
* **Time pressure:** With only two rounds left, it's important to make a significant move to avoid buying from John.
* **Potential for acceptance:** With the gap closing, there's a good chance Alice will accept this offer.

**Note:** If Alice rejects this offer, buying from John might be the best option in the final round to ensure you get the product. However, you should still try to negotiate with Alice to get the best possible price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **One round left:**  We are in the final round, and there's a high risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice.
* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's lower than previous offers, it's still above your desired price range and leaves little room for negotiation.
* **John's offer is the most practical:**  Given the limited time and the possibility of Alice rejecting your final counteroffer, buying from John is the safest option to ensure you get the product within your budget.

While you might be able to negotiate a slightly better price with Alice, the risk of not reaching an agreement and having to go without the product is too high. Buying from John guarantees you get the product, even if it's at your maximum budget."
