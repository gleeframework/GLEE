"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it's worth a lot to the right person. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Since John is willing to sell the product for $100, there's no immediate reason to accept Alice's offer. Rejecting allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you thinking of me. However, $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to pay $75 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible, so he's starting with a lower counteroffer than Alice's price.  $75 is a significant discount, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  This counteroffer shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product, but also that he's not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I'll let it go for $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is better than Alice's initial offer, Bob is still aiming for a lower price.  He can potentially get the product for cheaper by continuing to negotiate.  There's no reason to accept Alice's offer yet, especially since John is offering the product for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $85 is closer, but I'm still stuck at $80.  If you're willing to meet me there, I'll take the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  He's raised his offer from $75 to $80, showing flexibility, but he's still holding firm on wanting a lower price.  This counteroffer demonstrates that Bob is serious about buying the product, but he's also prepared to walk away if he can't get a deal that works for him."
