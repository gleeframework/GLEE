{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it's worth a lot to the right person. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. I want to leave room for negotiation while ensuring I get at least my minimum desired profit.  Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you thinking of me. However, $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to pay $75 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is more than my minimum, it's still below my ideal price. I'm going to reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my desired $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I'll let it go for $85?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm offering a compromise with a price that's closer to my ideal price, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  Let's see if Bob's willing to meet me halfway!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $85 is closer, but I'm still stuck at $80.  If you're willing to meet me there, I'll take the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum price.  While I'd prefer to get more, I'm happy to accept his offer and close the deal.  It's a good outcome for both of us."
