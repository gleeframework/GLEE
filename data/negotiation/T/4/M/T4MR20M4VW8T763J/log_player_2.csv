"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair price for such a valuable asset. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John initially, it's still above Bob's $1,000,000 limit. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to negotiate with Alice or go directly to John, securing the product for a lower price."
