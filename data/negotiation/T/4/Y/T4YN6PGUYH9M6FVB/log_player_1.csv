Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will greatly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential return on your investment."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, I aim to maximize my profit.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $800,000, so I need to offer a price significantly lower than John's offer to make it attractive.
* **Negotiating Room:** The offer of $1,400,000 leaves room for potential negotiation while still securing a substantial profit above Bob's perceived value.
* **Confident Tone:** The message uses positive language to highlight the product's value and instill confidence in Bob."
