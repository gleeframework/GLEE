Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I can go as high as $120. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure about $110. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. It's a great product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm not sure I can go up to $105. I'd be willing to meet you at $100, but that's as high as I can go.

At this point, it's better to accept Bob's offer for $100.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob will walk away completely, leaving you with only the $80 offer from John.  $100 is still a decent profit for you, and it's likely that Bob won't budge much further."
