Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its worth significantly more in the market."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as much money as possible. Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product slightly below my guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, there's a slight possibility Bob might counter-offer, bringing the price closer to $1,500,000.

**Important:** This strategy assumes I don't have significant time constraints. If I need to sell quickly, offering it to Bob at my guaranteed price ($1,500,000) would ensure the sale."
