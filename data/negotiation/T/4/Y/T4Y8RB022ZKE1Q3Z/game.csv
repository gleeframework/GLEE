"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being flexible, but $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $85?  That would be a fair deal for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $87.50. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",87.5,Alice,3,
