Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate if he makes a counteroffer, but also indicates I'm confident in the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $110 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum value of $120.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm offering $115. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his offer of $110 and my previous offer of $130.  It shows willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is stubbornly sticking to $110.  While I could keep negotiating, there's no guarantee we'll reach an agreement, and I'm risking further time and effort with no guarantee of a better outcome.  John is offering my minimum price, and I'm choosing to sell to him for certainty and a guaranteed return."
