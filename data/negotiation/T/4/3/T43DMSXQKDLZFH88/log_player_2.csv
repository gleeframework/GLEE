"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it for significantly less than its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than her own valuation of the product ($800,000). There's a lot of room for negotiation.  While buying from John is an option, it makes sense to try negotiating a lower price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. How about $700,000? I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a price significantly lower than Alice's offer but still comfortably above her valuation. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a good deal. 
* **Appearing Reasonable:** My message aims to come across as fair and open to negotiation, rather than aggressively lowballing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to negotiate, but $700,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about $900,000? This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $900,000 is still a significant markup from her $800,000 valuation. It's worth another counteroffer to see if we can get closer to a price that benefits both of us.  We're still well below our ""buy from John"" threshold."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?  That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Targeting Her Valuation:** I'm now proposing a price that matches Alice's own valuation of the product. This is a strong negotiating point, as it suggests I'm aware of the product's true worth.
* **Compromise Language:** By framing it as ""meeting in the middle"" and a ""fair compromise,"" I'm signaling a willingness to settle but also standing firm on a price that works for me. 
* **Risk Assessment:** There's a chance Alice will reject this and try to hold out for more. If that happens, I'll need to decide if it's worth risking John's offer for a potentially slightly better deal."
