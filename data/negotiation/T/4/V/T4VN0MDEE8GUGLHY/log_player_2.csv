"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $70. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $70
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation to try and get a better price.  We'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for showing me the product, Alice. I'm interested, but $70 is a little high for me.  Would you consider $55?"",
""product_price"": 55
}
```

We're starting with a counter-offer significantly lower than Alice's starting price. This leaves room for negotiation and increases the chances of getting a price closer to our target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $70 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $65. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $65
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we're still aiming lower. We'll reject and counter-offer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we split the difference at $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

We're inching closer to a potentially agreeable price. Offering to ""split the difference"" often feels fair to both sides."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go all the way down to $60, Bob. But I'm willing to compromise further. How about $62? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $62. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $62
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to meet in the middle.  $62 is a good deal, and further haggling might make us lose the opportunity for a discount."
