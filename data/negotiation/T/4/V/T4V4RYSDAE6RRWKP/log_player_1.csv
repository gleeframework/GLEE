Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is more than Bob values it at ($80), but less than my minimum acceptable price ($120). 
* **Message:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to motivate Bob to accept the offer. 

This strategy allows me to potentially earn more than my minimum price while still having a backup buyer in John."
