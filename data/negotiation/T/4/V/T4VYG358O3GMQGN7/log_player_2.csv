"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $12,000 is still above Bob's ideal price point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's minimum acceptable value, but still leaving room for negotiation.  Starting at $10,500 signals a serious intent to purchase while leaving space for potential counteroffers from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,500 is closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still not ideal.  Alice has shown some flexibility, but Bob can likely still push for a lower price.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and might lead to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing that he is serious about making a deal, but still trying to stay below his $12,000 limit.  $11,000 is a reasonable compromise that might convince Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is slowly increasing her price, making the deal less attractive for Bob. However, there's still room for negotiation, and Bob is determined to get the product at the lowest possible price. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation alive and allows Bob to continue making counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, showing Alice he's willing to compromise.  $11,500 is a fair midpoint between their previous offers, and it gives Alice a good reason to accept. With only 4 rounds remaining, Bob needs to find a price that will be acceptable to both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's price keeps inching up, but Bob is still committed to getting a better deal.  He has only 3 rounds left before needing to buy from John, so he needs to find a way to convince Alice to lower her price.  Rejecting this offer gives him one more chance to counter."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his limit, but he still wants to save some money.  He's increasing his offer one last time to show Alice he's serious about buying, but also leaving room for Alice to counter if she wants.  If Alice rejects this offer, Bob will have no choice but to buy from John in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now above Bob's maximum budget.  With only one round left, the odds of reaching a mutually agreeable price are slim.  It's better for Bob to buy from John for $15,000 than to risk Alice rejecting his counteroffer and leaving him with no product."
