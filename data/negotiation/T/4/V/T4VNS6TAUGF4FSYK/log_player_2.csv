"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd really appreciate. It's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $90. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice's offer is overpriced. You can get the product for $100 from John, so there's no need to pay $90. By rejecting her offer, you might be able to negotiate a better price or stick with your backup option."
