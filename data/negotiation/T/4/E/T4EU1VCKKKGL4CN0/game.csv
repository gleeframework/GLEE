"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $100. I understand that $180 might be a stretch, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $140. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,
