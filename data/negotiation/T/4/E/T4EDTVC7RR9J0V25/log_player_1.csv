Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $11500 is a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $10500? That's still a good price for you and it would be a great deal for me.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
