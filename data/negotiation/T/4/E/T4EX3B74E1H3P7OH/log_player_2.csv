"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $14,000. I think it could really be valuable to you, and this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a decent price, it's still above his ideal price point.  He has 10 rounds to negotiate, so rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best option to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $13,000. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $13,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $13,750. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to pay less than $13,000. While Alice has moved closer to his counteroffer, $13,750 is still above his target. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if he can get a better price in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer. I'd be happy to pay $13,250. Let's split the difference and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? That's my final offer.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a Compromise:** Alice's offer of $13,500 is a good compromise. It's slightly above Bob's last counteroffer but below his initial target.
* **Time is Running Out:** This is round 5. With only 5 rounds left, there's a risk that the negotiation might stall further, or Alice might become less willing to compromise.
* **Better than John:**  $13,500 is still significantly cheaper than buying from John for $15,000.

While Bob might ideally want a lower price, accepting the offer at this point secures a good deal and prevents the risk of losing the opportunity."
