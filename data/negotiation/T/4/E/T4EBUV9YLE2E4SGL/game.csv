"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as high as $2,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is closer to the mark, the value this product represents, particularly in terms of its potential, warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
