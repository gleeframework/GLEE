"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential and value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Appear Confident:** Expressing confidence in the product's value can influence Bob's perception. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The initial high price signals a willingness to negotiate, which can encourage Bob to engage in the process.

**Important:** While John's offer of $1,500,000 is a guaranteed fallback, our goal is to maximize profit.  We don't want to settle for John's offer prematurely, especially since we have 10 rounds to negotiate with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as high as $2,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is above his perceived value, it's still below our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. We have room to negotiate and try to bridge the gap.  John's offer provides a safety net, but we're aiming higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is closer to the mark, the value this product represents, particularly in terms of its potential, warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're reducing our price by $200,000, signaling flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Highlighting Value:**  We're reiterating the product's potential value to justify a price above Bob's offer and closer to our minimum. 
* **Seeking Middle Ground:**  This counteroffer aims to move negotiations towards a price point between Bob's offer and our previous ask."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another concession and propose a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now above our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While we could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob might reduce his offer or walk away. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
