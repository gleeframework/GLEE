Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a potential offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **One Shot:** You have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you lose the chance to get more than $1,000,000.

**Offer Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob finds the offer acceptable. A price too close to $1,200,000 might make him balk, while a price too low leaves money on the table.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a price of $1,150,000, reflecting a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and exclusivity.
* **Price:** $1,150,000 allows both parties to benefit. You gain a significant $150,000 over your minimum, and Bob saves $50,000 compared to his perceived value.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher to allow room for negotiation. 
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is paramount, you might consider a slightly lower price for long-term goodwill. 

This offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal."
