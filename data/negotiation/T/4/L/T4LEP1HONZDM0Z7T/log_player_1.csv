(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $85 is too low for me.  I'll try to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $90? This is still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 90}
