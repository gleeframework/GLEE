It's better to try and get a better price from Alice. You can still buy from John, so there's no immediate risk in rejecting and counteroffering."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1050000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is a good compromise, and it's still significantly lower than what John is offering.  Accepting this offer allows you to save $150,000."
