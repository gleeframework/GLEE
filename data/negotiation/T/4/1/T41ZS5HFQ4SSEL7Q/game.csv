"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below my minimum. To be fair to both of us, let's meet in the middle. How about $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that number. How about we try $1,050,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
