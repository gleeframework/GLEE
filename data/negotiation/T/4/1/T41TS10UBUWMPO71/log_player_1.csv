Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, I want to see if I can get even more from Bob.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000. Offering it for less than that would be leaving money on the table.
* **Negotiating Room:** The price of $1,400,000 gives Bob a substantial discount while still netting me a significant profit above my minimum.
* **Urgency:** By mentioning other buyers and a limited-time offer, I'm adding a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to accept."
