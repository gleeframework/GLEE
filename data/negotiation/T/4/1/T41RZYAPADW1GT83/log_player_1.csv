{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $200."",

}
```

I'm starting high to give myself room to negotiate. While I'm willing to go down to $150, I want to see if I can get closer to Bob's perceived value of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I know I have a buyer at $150, so I'll counter-offer and see if I can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. While $80 is a little low for me, I'm willing to come down to $160. This product is really worth it, and I believe you'll be very happy with it."",
""product_price"": 160
}
```

I've decided to make a significant jump down from my initial offer but still stay significantly above both Bob's offer and my minimum price. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also signals the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $120 is a more reasonable price for me. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I could hold out for $150 from John, accepting Bob's offer of $120 is still a profit, and avoids the risk of further negotiation. It's a reasonable compromise."
