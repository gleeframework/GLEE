Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:** I need at least $1,500,000 for this product.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation:** This offer is a compromise. It's significantly lower than my minimum, but higher than Bob's valuation.  This gives him room to negotiate if he wants, but also makes it attractive enough that he might accept.
* **Backup:**  If Bob rejects, I have John lined up to buy at $1,500,000, so I'm not risking anything. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while still having a good chance of securing a deal with Bob."
