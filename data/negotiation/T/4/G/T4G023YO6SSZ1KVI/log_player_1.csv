I'm starting with my ideal price, $1,200,000. This is the price that John is willing to pay, so it gives me a good starting point and leaves no room for negotiation if Bob rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my ideal price and what John is willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm offering Bob a price of $1,100,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still higher than what Bob offered and closer to my desired price. I'm hoping this will entice Bob to accept and avoid having to sell to John at a lower price."
