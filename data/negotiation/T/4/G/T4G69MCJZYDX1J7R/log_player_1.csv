Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,500,000** is a starting point that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* This allows for potential negotiation and leaves room for Bob to feel he's getting a good deal if he agrees.
* There's no way to know what the product is worth to Bob, so starting high and potentially negotiating down is a good strategy.
* If Bob rejects, I can always sell to John for my minimum acceptable price, guaranteeing a profit."
