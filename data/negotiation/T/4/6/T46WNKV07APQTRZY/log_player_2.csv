"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is better than $10,000, there's still room for negotiation. Alice is likely willing to come down from her initial price, and you can try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a little less.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, as Alice has a lot of room to lower her price before reaching her minimum. This is a good starting point for negotiation. I've also added a friendly message to keep the communication positive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $9,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to pay more than $8,500, but I want to see if I can get her closer to that number before making a decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a compromise price that is closer to Alice's last offer but still within my budget. I'm hoping this will be appealing enough for Alice to accept, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
