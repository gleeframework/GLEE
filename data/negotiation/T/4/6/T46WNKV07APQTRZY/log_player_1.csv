Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $9,500 is higher than your minimum of $8,000, meaning you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's a $500 gap between your offer and Bob's perceived value, giving him incentive to negotiate but not making the offer feel too high. 
* **It's a strong starting point:**  By offering a price closer to your desired outcome, you set the tone for a negotiation that favors you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a little less.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above your minimum acceptable price, there's still room for a higher price.  Rejecting the offer and sending a counteroffer gives you a better chance to get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $9,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,750 is a good compromise. It's above your minimum acceptable price of $8,000 and it's a reasonable middle ground between your last counteroffer and his last offer.  Accepting the offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or a stalemate."
