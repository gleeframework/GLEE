"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay significantly less.  Considering your own value for the product, I'm willing to pay $600000. This price represents a fair compromise, allowing you to make a decent profit while ensuring I get a great deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $600000. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $750000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's worth and will still provide a good return for both of us.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $750000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $700000, which would be a fair compromise for both of us. This offer allows you to make a healthy profit while ensuring I get a great deal. I hope we can reach an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not convinced that $700000 is enough to justify the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $775000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's worth and will still provide a good return for both of us.",775000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $775000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to offer a final price of $725000. This represents a fair compromise, and allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  If we can't agree on this price, I'll unfortunately have to look at other options.",725000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a fair compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not convinced that $725000 is enough to justify the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $750000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price.",750000.0,Alice,7,
