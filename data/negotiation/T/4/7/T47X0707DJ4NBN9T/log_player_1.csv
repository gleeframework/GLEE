{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing [product description] and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiating a fair price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  We're opening with a price of $20,000, giving us some room to negotiate downwards. 
* **Highlighting value:** We mention the product's qualities to pique Bob's interest and emphasize its potential value to him. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  We signal our willingness to negotiate, making Bob feel more comfortable engaging in the process. 

**Important Notes:**

* This initial offer is a starting point. We will adjust based on Bob's response and our goal of maximizing profit. 
* We have a backup buyer in John, which gives us confidence in the negotiation process. We can always walk away if the deal isn't good enough."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the [product description], but $20000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be willing to come down to $15000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $15,000 is our minimum, and we're not willing to accept anything less than that. 
* **We have room to negotiate:** We're confident we can get a better price from Bob.  Since we have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay our minimum, we can afford to push for a higher price.
* **We're willing to counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows us to send a counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the [product description]. I understand $20,000 might be a bit steep.  However, considering its quality and potential value to you, I'd be willing to come down to $18,000. It's a fair price that still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can strike a deal!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **We acknowledge Bob's concerns:**  We show we're listening and are willing to compromise by lowering our price.
* **We highlight the product's value:**  We remind Bob of the product's qualities, emphasizing its worth.
* **We're still asking for a good price:**  $18,000 is a decent compromise, allowing us to earn more than our minimum while showing flexibility. 
* **We encourage further negotiation:**  We end with a positive tone, hoping to keep the conversation going and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $16500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Bob's offer of $16,500 is a good compromise, closer to our desired price of $18,000. 
* **Above our minimum:** This offer is above our minimum of $15,000, allowing us to make a profit.
* **Time is money:** Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a better price, but it also risks losing the deal altogether.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a good profit."
