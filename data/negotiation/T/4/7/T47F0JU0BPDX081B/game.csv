"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this product for a very competitive price of $1,200,000.  This is a significant value proposition, and I'm confident it will be a mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go at this point.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This would allow us both to benefit from the transaction.  Let's find a middle ground and make this happen.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is my final offer, so please let me know if it's acceptable to you.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but unfortunately, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.  Let's make this happen.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm not willing to go up to $1,000,000. I'm still thinking $900,000 is a fair price. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options.",900000.0,Bob,6,
