"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product while also remaining within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,025,000. I believe this price is still a great value for the product, and I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still slightly above my budget. I'm ready to pay $975,000 for the product. This price would be fair to both of us and allow me to stay within my financial limits.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $975,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $1,015,000. This price is still a great value for the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1015000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm determined to find a way to make this work within my budget.  Let's split the difference and agree on $1,000,000.  This is a fair price, and it allows me to stay within my financial limits while ensuring you still make a good profit.  I hope you'll consider this final offer.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to accept $1,000,000. I'm still not getting the profit I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
