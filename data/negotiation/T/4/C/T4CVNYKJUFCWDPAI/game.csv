"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $1,750,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  That said, $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000?",1375000.0,Bob,4,
