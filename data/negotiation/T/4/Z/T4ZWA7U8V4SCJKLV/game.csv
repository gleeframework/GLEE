,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is far below what I can accept.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $105?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a reasonable price. ",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle. How about we try $75? That's a fair bit closer to your price and would make this a good deal for me.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $75 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $90. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle at $80? That's the highest I can go, but I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",80.0,Bob,6,
