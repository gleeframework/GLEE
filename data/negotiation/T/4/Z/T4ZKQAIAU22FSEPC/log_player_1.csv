Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $12,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the price, even if it's a general statement about value, can make the offer seem more reasonable.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give me valuable information about his willingness to pay. If he outright rejects it, I know I need to come down significantly. If he counteroffers, I can get a better sense of his price range. 

Remember, I always have the $8,000 offer from John as a safety net, so I can afford to be a bit bolder in my negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me.  Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly lower than both my minimum acceptable price ($8,000) and his own stated value for the product ($8,000).  Accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss for me. I believe there's room for negotiation, so I will reject his offer and propose a counteroffer closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. This product offers significant value, and I need to price it accordingly. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,000?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I'm moving closer to the middle ground to demonstrate willingness to negotiate.
* **Hold Firm (For Now):**  While $10,000 is a significant decrease from my initial offer, it's still a profit, and I want to see if Bob is willing to move closer to my range.
* **Clear Justification:** I'm reiterating the value proposition to reinforce why the price isn't arbitrarily high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Approaching the Bottom Line:** Bob's offer of $7,000 is getting close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Potential for More:** I still believe there's a chance Bob might be willing to go a bit higher, especially since he stated the product is worth $8,000 to him. 
* **Limited Downside:**  If my next counteroffer fails, I can always sell to John for $8,000. At this point, the potential gain from negotiating with Bob outweighs the risk of losing a small amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. How about we split the difference and settle at $8,500? This ensures a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 8500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:** I'm making a smaller concession this time, signaling that I'm nearing my limit. 
* **Split the Difference:** This is a common negotiation tactic that can feel fair to both parties and might encourage Bob to agree.
* **Preserving Profit:** $8,500 still provides a reasonable profit margin over my minimum and John's standing offer."
