"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to save as much money as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to further negotiation if you're willing to meet me halfway.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
