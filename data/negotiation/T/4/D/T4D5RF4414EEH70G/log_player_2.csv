"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, it's wise to reject the initial offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  There's no reason to accept the offer at the full price when there's a chance to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. Given the market, I'd be willing to pay $750,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Counteroffer:**  A $250,000 reduction is a significant counteroffer, showing Bob is serious about negotiating. 
* **Fairness:**  While Bob is aiming for a lower price, he's not being unreasonable and is open to compromise.
* **Motivation:** By presenting a concrete offer, Bob encourages Alice to engage in the negotiation rather than just rejecting outright."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest. While $750000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise. I'm proposing a price of $850000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution.  Let's work together to finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** While Alice has reduced the price, it's still above Bob's target price of $750,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  There's still a $100,000 gap between Alice's offer and Bob's counteroffer. This means more negotiation is possible. 
* **Avoid hasty decisions:** Buying from John is still a viable option, but Bob should continue to see if he can get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $850,000 is still a little higher than where I'm comfortable.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000. This shows I'm committed to finding a deal, but it's the highest I can go at this point."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** Bob only increases his offer by $50,000, signaling a willingness to negotiate but not a drastic change in his position. 
* **Stated Limit:** By stating this is his ""highest,"" Bob creates pressure on Alice to make a decision.
* **Middle Ground:** This counteroffer attempts to find a midpoint between Bob's last offer and Alice's current offer."
