{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly lower than the product's worth to Bob, leaving some room for negotiation. It also includes a friendly message to make the offer more appealing and open to discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for it. Please let me know if this is possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is the same as what John is offering, I'm going to reject it and see if I can get a higher price from Bob.  I'm confident that the product is worth more to him than $12,000 and I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. The product is still worth more than $12,000 to me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still unable to meet at $13,000. Could we perhaps agree on $12,500? This would allow me to stay within my budget while also compensating for the value you place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is a good compromise and brings us closer to a deal.  While it's slightly lower than I'd hoped for, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. It's also a better option than selling to John at $12,000.  I'll take the deal and be happy to move forward with the transaction."
