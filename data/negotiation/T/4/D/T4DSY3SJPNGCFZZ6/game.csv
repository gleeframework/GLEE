,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. The product is still worth more than $12,000 to me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away happy.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still unable to meet at $13,000. Could we perhaps agree on $12,500? This would allow me to stay within my budget while also compensating for the value you place on the product.",12500.0,Bob,4,
