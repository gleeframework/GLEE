"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $90 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**
