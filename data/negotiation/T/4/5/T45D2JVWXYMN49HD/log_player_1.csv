"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $145.  This is a good starting point that leaves room for negotiation, but still gives me a profit above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I want to try and get closer to my original asking price. I'll reject his offer and see if we can come to a compromise in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm going to lower my price to $140. This is a small concession that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it still keeps the price above my minimum and hopefully encourages Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now $135.  This is above my minimum of $120, and with a few more rounds of negotiation I may not be able to get a significantly better price. I'm going to accept his offer."
