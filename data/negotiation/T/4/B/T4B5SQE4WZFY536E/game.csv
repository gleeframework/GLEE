"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value you mentioned earlier, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but $10,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $9,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'll offer the product to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great value for you.",10500.0,Alice,5,
