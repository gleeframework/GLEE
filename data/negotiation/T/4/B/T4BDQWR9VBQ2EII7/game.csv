"Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering your product. Unfortunately, $18,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This is still a good deal for you, given the value of the product.  Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
