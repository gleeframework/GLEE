Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $135. I think it would be very valuable to you, but if you're not interested, no worries!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible, without going below your minimum acceptable price ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting a bit higher than Bob's perceived value allows for potential negotiation. He might counter-offer, giving you the chance to lower the price slightly and still make a profit. 
* **Alternative Option:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, so there's no pressure to go below your minimum. 

By offering the product at $135, you create a win-win scenario where Bob might feel he's getting a deal, and you still make a profit."
